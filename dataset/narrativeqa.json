MCGREGOR & PETER & BENJAMIN\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt is said that the effect of eating too much lettuce is \"soporific.\"\n\n_I_ have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then _I_ am not a\nrabbit.\n\nThey certainly had a very soporific effect upon the Flopsy Bunnies!\n\nWhen Benjamin Bunny grew up, he married his Cousin Flopsy. They had a\nlarge family, and they were very improvident and cheerful.\n\nI do not remember the separate names of their children; they were\ngenerally called the \"Flopsy Bunnies.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAs there was not always quite enough to eat,--Benjamin used to borrow\ncabbages from Flopsy's brother, Peter Rabbit, who kept a nursery garden.\n\nSometimes Peter Rabbit had no cabbages to spare.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen this happened, the Flopsy Bunnies went across the field to a rubbish\nheap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.\n\nMr. McGregor's rubbish heap was a mixture. There were jam pots and paper\nbags, and mountains of chopped grass from the mowing machine (which always\ntasted oily), and some rotten vegetable marrows and an old boot or two.\nOne day--oh joy!--there were a quantity of overgrown lettuces, which had\n\"shot\" into flower.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Flopsy Bunnies simply stuffed lettuces. By degrees, one after another,\nthey were overcome with slumber, and lay down in the mown grass.\n\nBenjamin was not so much overcome as his children. Before going to sleep\nhe was sufficiently wide awake to put a paper bag over his head to keep\noff the flies.\n\nThe little Flopsy Bunnies slept delightfully in the warm sun. From the\nlawn beyond the garden came the distant clacketty sound of the mowing\nmachine. The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse\npicked over the rubbish among the jam pots.\n\n(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a\nwoodmouse with a long tail.)\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThe mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.\n\nWhile she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a\nheavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a\nsackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!\nBenjamin shrank down under his paper bag. The mouse hid in a jam pot.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of\ngrass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.\n\nThey dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.\n\nMr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little\nbrown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them\nfor some time.\n\nPresently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.\n\nMr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--\n\n\"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\" said he as he dropped\nthem into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was\nturning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still\nthey did not wake up.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.\n\nHe went to put away the mowing machine.\n\nWhile he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came\nacross the field.\n\nShe looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen the mouse came out of her jam pot, and Benjamin took the paper bag\noff his head, and they told the doleful tale.\n\nBenjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.\n\nBut Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the\nbottom corner of the sack.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.\n\nTheir parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows,\nan old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.\n\nHe carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.\n\nThe Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe watched him go into his house.\n\nAnd then they crept up to the window to listen.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would\nhave been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to\nhave been inside it.\n\nThey could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\" enquired Mrs.\nMcGregor.\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr.\nMcGregor, counting on his fingers--\"one, two, three--\"\n\n\"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"\n\n\"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.\n\n(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)\n\nMrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel\nsix, but they must be _old_ rabbits, because they were so hard and all\ndifferent shapes.\n\n\"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"\n\n\"Line your old cloak?\" shouted Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them and buy\nmyself baccy!\"\n\n\"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.\n\nWhen she felt the vegetables she became very very angry. She said that Mr.\nMcGregor had \"done it a purpose.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying\nthrough the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.\n\nIt was rather hurt.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSo Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her\nrabbit skins.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough\nrabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a\npair of warm mittens.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TALE OF THE FLOPSY BUNNIES\n\nBY BEATRIX POTTER\n\nF.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n",

The bluebottles buzzed about the wall, and a little old mouse\npicked over the rubbish among the jam pots.\n\n(I can tell you her name, she was called Thomasina Tittlemouse, a\nwoodmouse with a long tail.)\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe rustled across the paper bag, and awakened Benjamin Bunny.\n\nThe mouse apologized profusely, and said that she knew Peter Rabbit.\n\nWhile she and Benjamin were talking, close under the wall, they heard a\nheavy tread above their heads; and suddenly Mr. McGregor emptied out a\nsackful of lawn mowings right upon the top of the sleeping Flopsy Bunnies!\nBenjamin shrank down under his paper bag.",
      " The mouse hid in a jam pot.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe little rabbits smiled sweetly in their sleep under the shower of\ngrass; they did not awake because the lettuces had been so soporific.\n\nThey dreamt that their mother Flopsy was tucking them up in a hay bed.\n\nMr. McGregor looked down after emptying his sack. He saw some funny little\nbrown tips of ears sticking up through the lawn mowings. He stared at them\nfor some time.\n\nPresently a fly settled on one of them and it moved.\n\nMr. McGregor climbed down on to the rubbish heap--\n\n\"One, two, three, four! five! six leetle rabbits!\" said he as he dropped\nthem into his sack. The Flopsy Bunnies dreamt that their mother was\nturning them over in bed. They stirred a little in their sleep, but still\nthey did not wake up.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. McGregor tied up the sack and left it on the wall.\n\nHe went to put away the mowing machine.\n\nWhile he was gone, Mrs. Flopsy Bunny (who had remained at home) came\nacross the field.\n\nShe looked suspiciously at the sack and wondered where everybody was?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen the mouse came out of her jam pot,",
      " and Benjamin took the paper bag\noff his head, and they told the doleful tale.\n\nBenjamin and Flopsy were in despair, they could not undo the string.\n\nBut Mrs. Tittlemouse was a resourceful person. She nibbled a hole in the\nbottom corner of the sack.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe little rabbits were pulled out and pinched to wake them.\n\nTheir parents stuffed the empty sack with three rotten vegetable marrows,\nan old blacking-brush and two decayed turnips.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen they all hid under a bush and watched for Mr. McGregor.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. McGregor came back and picked up the sack, and carried it off.\n\nHe carried it hanging down, as if it were rather heavy.\n\nThe Flopsy Bunnies followed at a safe distance.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe watched him go into his house.\n\nAnd then they crept up to the window to listen.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMr. McGregor threw down the sack on the stone floor in a way that would\nhave been extremely painful to the Flopsy Bunnies, if they had happened to\nhave been inside it.\n\nThey could hear him drag his chair on the flags, and chuckle--\n\n\"One,",
      " two, three, four, five, six leetle rabbits!\" said Mr. McGregor.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Eh? What's that? What have they been spoiling now?\" enquired Mrs.\nMcGregor.\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five, six leetle fat rabbits!\" repeated Mr.\nMcGregor, counting on his fingers--\"one, two, three--\"\n\n\"Don't you be silly; what do you mean, you silly old man?\"\n\n\"In the sack! one, two, three, four, five, six!\" replied Mr. McGregor.\n\n(The youngest Flopsy Bunny got upon the window-sill.)\n\nMrs. McGregor took hold of the sack and felt it. She said she could feel\nsix, but they must be _old_ rabbits, because they were so hard and all\ndifferent shapes.\n\n\"Not fit to eat; but the skins will do fine to line my old cloak.\"\n\n\"Line your old cloak?\" shouted Mr. McGregor--\"I shall sell them and buy\nmyself baccy!\"\n\n\"Rabbit tobacco! I shall skin them and cut off their heads.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMrs. McGregor untied the sack and put her hand inside.\n\nWhen she felt the vegetables she became very very angry.",
      " She said that Mr.\nMcGregor had \"done it a purpose.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd Mr. McGregor was very angry too. One of the rotten marrows came flying\nthrough the kitchen window, and hit the youngest Flopsy Bunny.\n\nIt was rather hurt.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen Benjamin and Flopsy thought that it was time to go home.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSo Mr. McGregor did not get his tobacco, and Mrs. McGregor did not get her\nrabbit skins.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut next Christmas Thomasina Tittlemouse got a present of enough\nrabbit-wool to make herself a cloak and a hood, and a handsome muff and a\npair of warm mittens.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nTHE TALE OF THE FLOPSY BUNNIES\n\nBY BEATRIX POTTER\n\nF.

health and plenty cheer'd the labouring swain,\n\nWhere smiling spring its earliest visit paid,\n\nAnd parting summer's lingering blooms delay'd.\n\n{008}\n\n\n[Illustration: 0017]\n\n\nDear lovely bowers of innocence and ease,\n\nSeats of my youth, when every sport could please,\n\nHow often have I loiter'd o'er thy green,\n\nWhere humble happiness endear'd each scene!\n\nHow often have I paused on every charm,\n\nThe shelter'd cot, the cultivated farm,\n\n{009}\n\n\n[Illustration: 0020]\n\n\nThe never-failing brook, the busy mill,\n\nThe decent church that topt the neighbouring hill,\n\nThe hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,\n\nFor talking age and whispering lovers made!\n\nHow often have I blest the coming day,\n\nWhen toil remitting lent its turn to play,\n\n{010}\n\nAnd all the village train, from labour free,\n\nLed up their sports beneath the spreading tree;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0021]\n\n\nWhile many a pastime circled in the shade,\n\nThe young contending as the old survey'd;\n\nAnd many a gambol frolick'd o'er the ground,\n\nAnd sleights of art and feats of strength went round;\n\n{011}\n\nAnd still, as each repeated pleasure tired,\n\nSucceeding sports the mirthful band inspired:\n\nThe dancing pair that simply sought renown,\n\nBy holding out to tire each other down;\n\nThe swain mistrustless of his smutted face,\n\nWhile secret laughter titter'd round the place;\n\nThe bashful virgin's sidelong looks of love,\n\nThe matron's glance that would those looks reprove;\n\nThese were thy charms, sweet village! sports like these,\n\nWith sweet succession, taught e'en toil to please;\n\nThese round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed,\n\nThese were thy charms--but all these charms are fled.\n\nSweet smiling village, loveliest of the lawn!\n\nThy sports are fled, and all thy charms withdrawn;\n\nAmidst thy bowers the tyrant's hand is seen,\n\nAnd desolation saddens all thy green:\n\nOne only master grasps the whole domain,\n\nAnd half a tillage stints thy smiling plain:\n\nNo more thy glassy brook reflects the day,\n\nBut choked with sedges works its weedy way;\n\nAlong thy glades a solitary guest,\n\nThe hollow-sounding bittern guards its nest;\n\n{012}\n\nAmidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies,\n\nAnd tires their echoes with unvaried cries.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0025]\n\n\nSunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all,\n\nAnd the long grass o'ertops the mouldering wall;\n\nAnd trembling, shrinking from the spoiler's hand,\n\nFar, far away thy children leave the land.\n\n{013}\n\nIll  fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,\n\nWhere wealth accumulates, and men decay:\n\nPrinces and lords may flourish, or may fade;\n\nA breath can make them, as a breath has made:\n\nBut a bold peasantry, their country's pride,\n\nWhen once destroy'd, can never be supplied.\n\nA time there was, ere England's griefs began,\n\nWhen every rood of ground maintain'd its man;\n\nFor him light labour spread her wholesome store,\n\nJust gave what life required, but gave no more:\n\nHis best companions, innocence and health;\n\nAnd his best riches, ignorance of wealth.\n\nBut times are alter'd; trade's unfeeling train\n\nUsurp the land, and dispossess the swain;\n\nAlong the lawn, where scatter'd hamlets rose,\n\nUnwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose;\n\nAnd every want to luxury allied,\n\nAnd every pang that folly pays to pride.\n\nThose gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom,\n\nThose calm desires that ask'd but little room,\n\nThose healthful sports that graced the peaceful scene,\n\nLived in each look, and brighten'd all the green;\n\n{014}\n\nThese, far departing, seek a kinder shore,\n\nAnd rural mirth and manners are no more.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0027]\n\n\nSweet Auburn! parent of the blissful hour,\n\nThy glades forlorn confess the tyrant's power.\n\nHere, as I take my solitary rounds\n\nAmidst thy tangling walks and ruin'd grounds,\n\nAnd, many a year elapsed, return to view\n\nWhere once the cottage stood, the hawthorn grew,\n\nRemembrance wakes with all her busy train,\n\nSwells at my breast, and turns the past to pain.\n\n{015}\n\nIn all my wanderings round this world of care,\n\nIn all my griefs--and God has given my share--\n\n\n[Illustration: 0030]\n\n\nTo husband out life's taper at the close,\n\nAnd keep the flame from wasting by repose:\n\nI still had hopes, my latest hours to crown,\nAmidst these humble bowers to lay me down;\n\nI still had hopes, for pride attends us still,\n\nAmidst the swains to show my book-learn'd skill,\n\n{016}\n\nAround my fire an evening group to draw,\n\nAnd tell of all I felt, and all I saw;\n\nAnd, as a hare, whom hounds and horns pursue,\n\nPants to the place from whence at first he flew,\n\n\n[Illustration: 0031]\n\n\nI still had hopes, my long vexations past,\n\nHere to return--and die at home at last.\n\nO blest retirement, friend to life's decline,\n\nRetreats from care, that never must be mine:\n\nHow blest is he who crowns, in shades like these,\n\nA youth of labour with an age of ease;\n\n{017}\n\nWho quits a world where strong temptations try,\n\nAnd since 'tis hard to combat, learns to fly!\n\nFor him no wretches, born to work and weep,\n\nExplore the mine, or tempt the dangerous deep;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0034]\n\n\nNo surly porter stands, in guilty state,\n\nTo spurn imploring famine from the gate--\n\nBut on he moves to meet his latter end,\n\nAngels around befriending virtue's friend;\n\nSinks to the grave with unperceived decay,\n\nWhile resignation gently slopes the way;\n\n{018}\n\nAnd, all his prospects brightening to the last,\n\nHis heaven commences ere the world be past.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0035]\n\n\nSweet was the sound, when oft, at evening's close,\n\nUp yonder hill the village murmur rose:\n\nThere, as I pass'd with careless steps and slow,\n\nThe mingling notes came soften'd from below;\n\nThe swain responsive as the milk-maid sung,\n\nThe sober herd that low'd to meet their young;\n\nThe noisy geese that gabbled o'er the pool,\n\nThe playful children just let loose from school;\n\n{019}\n\nThe watch-dog's voice that bay'd the whispering wind,\n\nAnd the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0038]\n\n\nThese all in sweet confusion sought the shade,\n\nAnd fill'd each pause the nightingale had made.\n\nBut now the sounds of population fail:\n\nNo cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale,\n\nNo busy steps the grass-grown footway tread,\n\nBut all the bloomy flush of life is fled;\n\nAll but yon widow'd solitary thing,\n\nThat feebly bends beside the plashy spring:\n\n{020}\n\nShe, wretched matron, forced in age, for bread,\n\nTo strip the brook with mantling cresses spread\n\n\n[Illustration: 0039]\n\n\nTo pick her wintry faggot from the thorn,\n\nTo seek her nightly shed and weep till morn;\n\nShe only left of all the harmless train,\n\nThe sad historian of the pensive plain.\n\n{021}\n\nNear yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,\n\nAnd still where many a garden flower grows wild,\n\n\n[Illustration: 0042]\n\n\nThere, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,\n\nThe village preacher's modest mansion rose.\n\nA man he was to all the country dear,\n\nAnd passing rich with forty pounds a year;\n\n{022}\n\nRemote from towns he ran his godly race,\n\nNor e'er had changed, nor wish'd to change his place\n\n\n[Illustration: 0043]\n\n\nUnskilful he to fawn, or seek for power,\n\nBy doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour;\n\nFar other aims his heart had learn'd to prize,\n\nMore bent to raise the wretched than to rise.\n\n{023}\n\nHis house was known to all the vagrant train;\n\nHe chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain:\n\n\n[Illustration: 0046]\n\n\nThe long remember'd beggar was his guest,\n\nWhose beard descending swept his aged breast;\n\nThe ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,\n\nClaim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd;\n\n{024}\n\nThe broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,\n\nSate by his fire, and talk'd the night away;\n\nWept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,\n\nShoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won.\n\nPleased with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow,\n\nAnd quite forgot their vices in their woe;\n\nCareless their merits or their faults to scan,\n\nHis pity gave ere charity began.\n\nThus to relieve the wretched was his pride,\n\nAnd e'en his failings lean'd to virtue's side;\n\nBut in his duty prompt, at every call,\n\nHe watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt for all:\n\nAnd, as a bird each fond endearment tries\n\nTo tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,\n\nHe tried each art, reproved each dull delay,\n\nAllured to brighter worlds, and led the way.\n\nBeside the bed where parting life was laid,\n\nAnd sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,\n\nThe reverend champion stood. At his control,\n\nDespair and anguish fled the struggling soul;\n\n{025}\n\nComfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,\n\nAnd his last faltering accents whisper'd praise.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0050]\n\n\nAt church, with meek and unaffected grace,\n\nHis looks adorn'd the venerable place;\n\nTruth from his lips prevail'd with double sway,\n\nAnd fools, who came to scoff, remain'd to pray.\n\nThe service past, around the pious man,\n\nWith ready zeal each honest rustic ran:\n\n{026}\n\nE'en children follow'd with endearing wile,\n\nAnd pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile\n\n\n[Illustration: 0051]\n\n\nHis ready smile a parent's warmth express'd,\n\nTheir welfare pleased him, and their cares distress'd\n\nTo them his heart, his love, his griefs, were given,\n\nBut all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.\n\nAs some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,\n\nSwells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,\n\n{027}\n\nThough round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,\n\nEternal sunshine settles on its head.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0054]\n\n\nBeside yon straggling fence that skirts the way\n\nWith blossom'd furze, unprofitably gay,\n\nThere, in his noisy mansion, skill'd to rule,\n\nThe village master taught his little school:\n\nA man severe he was, and stern to view;\n\nI knew him well, and every truant knew:\n\n\n[Illustration: 0055]\n\n\nFull well they laugh'd with counterfeited glee\nAt all his jokes, for many a joke had he;\n\n{028}\n\nWell had the boding tremblers learn'd to trace\n\nThe day's disasters in his morning face:\n\nFull well the busy whisper, circling round,\n\nConvey'd the dismal tidings when he frown'd;\n\n{029}\n\nYet he was kind, or if severe in aught,\n\nThe love he bore to learning was in fault:\n\nThe village all declared how much he knew;\n\n'Twas certain he could write and cipher too:\n\nLands he could measure, terms and tides presage,\n\nAnd e'en the story ran that he could gauge:\n\n\n[Illustration: 0058]\n\n\nIn arguing too the parson own'd his skill,\n\nFor e'en though vanquish'd, he could argue still;\n\n{030}\n\nWhile words of learned length, and thundering sound,\n\nAmazed the gazing rustics ranged around;\n\nAnd still they gazed, and still the wonder grew\n\nThat one small head could carry all he knew.\n\nBut past is all his fame: the very spot,\n\nWhere many a time he triumph'd, is forgot.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0059]\n\n\nNear yonder thorn that lifts its head on high,\n\nWhere once the sign-post caught the passing eye,\n\nLow lies that house where nut-brown draughts inspired,\n\nWhere grey-beard mirth and smiling toil retired,\n\n{031}\n\nWhere village statesmen talk'd with looks profound,\n\nAnd news much older than their ale went round.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0062]\n\n\nImagination fondly stoops to trace\n\nThe parlour splendours of that festive place;\n\nThe white-wash'd wall, the nicely-sanded floor,\n\nThe varnish'd clock that click'd behind the door;\n\n{032}\n\nThe chest contrived a double debt to pay,\n\nA bed by night, a chest of drawers by day;\n\nThe pictures placed for ornament and use,\n\nThe twelve good rules, the royal game of goose\n\nThe hearth, except when winter chill'd the day,\n\nWith aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay\n\nWhile broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,\n\nRanged o'er the chimney, glisten'd in a row.\n\nVain, transitory splendours! could not all\n\nReprieve the tottering mansion from its fall I\n\nObscure it sinks, nor shall it more impart\n\nAn hour's importance to the poor man's heart:\n\nThither no more the peasant shall repair\n\nTo sweet oblivion of his daily care:\n\nNo more the farmer's news, the barber's tale,\n\nNo more the woodman's ballad shall prevail;\n\nNo more the smith his dusky brow shall clear,\n\nRelax his ponderous strength, and lean to hear;\n\nThe host himself no longer shall be found\n\nCareful to see the mantling bliss go round;\n\nNor the coy maid, half willing to be prest,\n\nShall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest.\n\n{033}\n\nYes! let the rich deride, the proud disdain,\n\nThese simple blessings of the lowly train:\n\nTo me more dear, congenial to my heart,\n\nOne native charm, than all the gloss of art;\n\nSpontaneous joys, where nature has its play,\n\nThe soul adopts, and owns their first-born sway;\n\nLightly they frolic o'er the vacant mind,\n\nUnenvied, unmolested, unconfined.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0066]\n\n\nBut the long pomp, the midnight masquerade,\n\nWith all the freaks of wanton wealth array'd,\n\nIn these, ere triflers half their wish obtain,\n\nThe toilsome pleasure sickens into pain;\n\n{034}\n\nAnd, e'en while fashion's brightest arts decoy,\n\nThe heart distrusting asks, if this be joy?\n\nYe friends to truth, ye statesmen, who survey\n\nThe rich man's joys increase, the poor's decay,\n\n'Tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand\n\nBetween a splendid and a happy land.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0067]\n\n\nProud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore,\n\nAnd shouting Folly hails them from her shore;\n\nHoards e'en beyond the miser's wish abound,\n\nAnd rich men flock from all the world around.\n\nYet count our gains. This wealth is but a name\n\nThat leaves our useful product still the same.\n\n{035}\n\nNot so the loss. The man of wealth and pride\n\nTakes up a space that many poor supplied;\n\nSpace for his lake, his park's extended bounds,\n\nSpace for his horses, equipage, and hounds;\n\nThe robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth\n\nHas robb'd the neighbouring fields of half their growth;\n\nHis seat, where solitary sports are seen,\n\nIndignant spurns the cottage from the green;\n\nAround the world each needful product flies,\n\nFor all the luxuries the world supplies:\n\nWhile thus the land, adorn'd for pleasure all,\n\nIn barren splendour feebly waits the fall.\n\nAs some fair female, unadorn'd and plain,\n\nSecure to please while youth confirms her reign,\n\nSlights every borrow'd charm that dress supplies,\n\nNor shares with art the triumph of her eyes;\n\nBut when those charms are past, for charms are frail,\n\nWhen time advances, and when lovers fail,\n\nShe then shines forth, solicitous to bless,\n\nIn all the glaring impotence of dress;\n\nThus fares the land, by luxury betray'd,\n\nIn nature's simplest charms at first array'd;\n\n{036}\n\nBut verging to decline, its splendours rise,\n\nIts vistas strike, its palaces surprise;\n\nWhile, scourged by famine, from the smiling land\n\nThe mournful peasant leads his humble band;\n\nAnd while he sinks, without one arm to save,\n\nThe country blooms--a garden and a grave!\n\nWhere then, ah! where shall poverty reside,\n\nTo 'scape the pressure of contiguous pride?\n\n\n[Illustration: 0071]\n\n\nIf to some common's fenceless limits stray'd,\n\nHe drives his flock to pick the scanty blade,\n\nThose fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide,\n\nAnd e'en the bare-worn common is denied.\n\n{037}\n\nIf to the city sped--What waits him there?\n\nTo see profusion, that he must not share;\n\nTo see ten thousand baneful arts combined\n\nTo pamper luxury, and thin mankind;\n\nTo see each joy the sons of pleasure know,\n\nExtorted from his fellow-creature's woe.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0074]\n\n\nHere, while the courtier glitters in brocade,\n\nThere the pale artist plies the sickly trade;\n\nHere, while the proud their long-drawn pomp display,\n\nThere the black gibbet glooms beside the way;\n\n{038}\n\nThe dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign,\n\nHere, richly deck'd, admits the gorgeous train;\n\nTumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square,\n\nThe rattling chariots clash, the torches glare.\n\nSure scenes like these no troubles e'er annoy!\n\nSure these denote one universal joy!\n\nAre these thy serious thoughts? Ah, turn thine eyes\n\nWhere the poor houseless shivering female lies:\n\nShe once, perhaps, in village plenty blest,\n\nHas wept at tales of innocence distrest;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0075]\n\n\nHer modest looks the cottage might adorn,\n\nSweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn;\n\n{039}\n\nNow lost to all; her friends, her virtue fled,\n\nNear her betrayer's door she lays her head,\n\nAnd, pinch'd with cold, and shrinking from the shower,\n\nWith heavy heart deplores that luckless hour\n\nWhen idly first, ambitious of the town,\n\nShe left her wheel and robes of country brown.\n\nDo thine, sweet Auburn, thine, the loveliest train,\n\nDo thy fair tribes participate her pain?\n\nE'en now, perhaps, by cold and hunger led,\n\nAt proud men's doors they ask a little bread!\n\nAh, no. To distant climes, a dreary scene,\n\nWhere half the convex world intrudes between,\n\nThrough torrid tracts with fainting steps they go,\n\nWhere wild Altama murmurs to their woe.\n\nFar different there from all that charm'd before,\n\nThe various terrors of that horrid shore;\n\nThose blazing suns that dart a downward ray,\n\nAnd fiercely shed intolerable day;\n\nThose matted woods where birds forget to sing,\n\nBut silent-bats in drowsy clusters cling;\n\n{040}\n\nThose poisonous fields with rank luxuriance crown'd,\n\nWhere the dark scorpion gathers death around;\n\nWhere at each step the stranger fears to wake\n\nThe rattling terrors of the vengeful snake;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0079]\n\n\nWhere crouching tigers wait their hapless prey,\n\nAnd savage men more murderous still than they;\n\nWhile oft in whirls the mad tornado flies,\n\nMingling the ravaged landscape with the skies.\n\nFar different these from every former scene,\n\nThe cooling brook, the grassy-vested green,\n\n{041}\n\nThe breezy covert of the warbling grove,\n\nThat only shelter'd thefts of harmless love.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0082]\n\n\nGood Heaven! what sorrows gloom'd that parting day,\n\nThat call'd them from their native walks away!\n\nWhen the poor exiles, every pleasure past,\n\nHung round the bowers, and fondly look'd their last,\n\nAnd took a long farewell, and wish'd in vain\n\nFor seats like these beyond the western main;\n\nAnd shuddering still to face the distant deep,\n\nReturn'd and wept, and still return'd to weep.\n\nThe good old sire the first prepared to go\n\nTo new-found worlds, and wept for others' woe;\n\n{042}\n\nBut for himself, in conscious virtue brave,\n\nHe only wish'd for worlds beyond the grave.\n\nHis lovely daughter, lovelier in her tears,\n\nThe fond companion of his helpless years,\n\n\n[Illustration: 0083]\n\n\nSilent went next, neglectful of her charms,\n\nAnd left a lover's for her father's arms.\n\nWith louder plaints the mother spoke her woes,\n\nAnd bless'd the cot where every pleasure rose;\n\nAnd kiss'd her thoughtless babes with many a tear,\n\nAnd clasp'd them close, in sorrow doubly dear;\n\n{043}\n\nWhilst her fond husband strove to lend relief,\n\nIn all the silent manliness of grief.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0086]\n\n\nO luxury! thou curst by Heaven's decree,\n\nHow ill exchanged are things like these for thee!\n\nHow do thy potions, with insidious joy,\n\nDiffuse their pleasures only to destroy!\n\nKingdoms by thee, to sickly greatness grown,\n\nBoast of a florid vigour not their own:\n\nAt every draught more large and large they grow,\n\nA bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe;\n\n{044}\n\nTill, sapp'd their strength, and every part unsound,\n\nDown, down they sink, and spread a ruin round.\n\nE'en now the devastation is begun,\n\nAnd half the business of destruction done;\n\nE'en now, methinks, as pondering here I stand,\n\nI see the rural virtues leave the land.\n\nDown where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail,\n\nThat idly waiting flaps with every gale;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0087]\n\n\nDownward they move, a melancholy band,\n\nPass from the shore, and darken all the strand.\n\nContented toil, and hospitable care,\n\nAnd kind connubial tenderness, are there;\n\nAnd piety, with wishes placed above,\n\nAnd steady loyalty, and faithful love.\n\n{045}\n\nAnd thou, sweet Poetry, thou loveliest maid,\n\nStill first to fly where sensual joys invade,\n\nUnfit, in these degenerate times of shame,\n\nTo catch the heart, or strike for honest fame;\n\nDear charming nymph, neglected and decried,\n\nMy shame in crowds, my solitary pride;\n\nThou source of all my bliss, and all my woe,\n\nThat found'st me poor at first, and keep'st me so;\n\n\n[Illustration: 0090]\n\n\nThou guide, by which the nobler arts excel,\n\nThou nurse of every virtue, fare thee well!\n\nFarewell! and oh! where'er thy voice be tried,\n\nOn Torno's cliffs, or Pambamarca's side,\n\nWhether where equinoctial fervors glow,\n\nOr winter wraps the polar world in snow,\n\n{046}\n\nStill let thy voice, prevailing over time,\n\nRedress the rigours of the inclement clime.\n\nAid slighted Truth with thy persuasive strain:\n\nTeach erring man to spurn the rage of gain;\n\nTeach him, that states of native strength possest,\n\nThough very poor, may still be very blest;\n\nThat trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,\n\nAs ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away;\n\nWhile self-dependent power can time defy,\n\nAs rocks resist the billows and the sky.\n\n\n[Illustration: 0091]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DESERTED VILLAGE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50500.txt or 50500.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/5/0/50500/\n\nProduced by David Widger from page images generously\nprovided by Google Books\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n",

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\n",
      "increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\n",
      "ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"

As it\n              spreads its wings to fly, we are whisked along the Australian\n              outback and prairie by Ayers rock and eventually slow down as we\n              approach Cody's house.)\n\n(scene:  inside Cody's room.  The camera pans around to show Cody sleeping\n         in his hammock.  The sound of Faloo's call is heard.  Cody hears\n         it, jumps out of bed, and runs to the window.  He puts on his\n         shirt and grabs his knife.)\n\n(scene:  Cody sneaks past his mother who is in the kitchen listening to the\n         radio.)\n\nAnnouncer:    ... thundershowers are expected in the Crocodile Falls area and\n              some of the surrounding gullies so take out your...\n\n(scene:  Outside Cody's house.  Cody leaves the house, and closes the door\n         behind him, but not quietly.)\n\nMom:     (from inside upon hearing the door) Cody!\n\nCody:    (whincing) Yeah mom?\n\nMom:     What about your breakfast?\n\nCody:    I've got some sandwiches in my pack.\n\nMom:     Well be home for supper.\n\nCody:    (hopping the gate) No worries mom.\n\n(scene:  Cody runs toward the forest; Faloo's call is heard in the\n         background.  He runs past some rock formations and enters the\n         woods.  Birds follow him; and squak at him.)\n\nCody:    (to the birds) I know, I'm coming.\n\n    (Cody jumps over a hollow log)\n          Hustle up Nelson, Faloo's sounding the call!\n\n    (Cody slides through a log, picks up a stick, and beats on the roof of\n    the wombats home.)\n          C'mon little wombats, hurry!\n\n    (Cody continues to run through the forest with all of the animals\n    following him.)\n\n    (Cody arrives at the tree where Faloo has been sounding the call.)\n\n         (to Faloo) Who's caught this time?\n\nFaloo:   You don't know her, Cody, her name is Marahute, the great golden\n         eagle.\n\nCody:    Where is she?\n\nFaloo:   She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.  You're the\n         only one who can reach her.\n\nCody:    I'll get her loose.\n\nFaloo:   Right-oh, hop on, no time to lose.\n\n    (Cody hops onto Faloo and they travel through the forest and along a\n    stream/river; more scenes of animals and the forest.)\n\n    (They arrive at the cliff.)\n\n         (pointing up towards the cliff) She's up on top of that ridge.  Be\n         careful lit'l friend.\n\n(scene:  various \"time lapse\" views of Cody climbing up the cliff.)\n\n    (Cody reaches the top and sees the eagle.)\n\nCody:    Marahute!\n\n    (Cody looks at the eagle; he approaches her slowly; she hears him and\n    wakes up; Marahute screeches and struggles to get free.)\n\n         (reassuring) Calm down, calm down.  I'm not gonna hurt you.  (Cody\n         strokes Marahute on the head) That's a girl.\n         Stay still... it's o.k.\n\n    (Cody gets out his knife; Marahute sees the glint of the knife and\n    begins to struggle and scream)\n\n         No wait!  I'm here to help you... easy!... easy!\n\n    (Cody cuts two ropes.  Cody cuts the last rope to free Marahute.)\n\n         You're free!!\n\n    (As Marahute spreads her wings to fly, she knocks Cody off the cliff.)\n\n         Aaaiigh!\n\n    (Cody falls; Marahute dives down to catch him; she catches him just\n    before he hits the ground; they begin to fly around; the animals see\n    Cody on Marahute and stand in awe; Marahute files over several rock\n    formations; the fly up above the clouds; Cody looks at his reflection in\n    Marahute's eye.)\n\n         Higher!\n\n    (They fly even higher above the clouds; Marahute throws Cody and catches\n    him; Cody is now held in Marahute's talons.)\n\n         Woah!\n\n    (Cody mocks an eagle screech; he laughs as Marahute tickles him; they\n    cruise above the clouds which eventually open up to show the ground;\n    Marahute nose dives towards the ground and a stream; she holds Cody just\n    high enough above the water so that he is water skiing; they approach a\n    flock of birds; Marahute lets Cody go and he skims through the birds,\n    scattering them; Marahute grabs Cody just before he falls in and then\n    put Cody right in front of her, on her beak (pushing him from behind);\n    they go over the egde of a waterfall; Marahute catches Cody again; this\n    time he rides by standing on her back; they arrive at Marahute's nest)\n\n         Wow!\n\n    (Cody and Marahute look at each other; Cody falls over as he attempts to\n    look at Marahute upside down. Marahute moves some grass and feathers to\n    show Cody her eggs)\n\n         You're a mom!\n\n    (Cody puts his ear to the eggs)\n\n         They're very warm.  Are they gonna hatch soon?\n\n    (Marahute ruffles her neck feathers in an affectionate manner; she sits\n    on the eggs and then looks out \"over her domain\".)\n\n         Where's the daddy eagle?  (Marahute drops her head) Oh... my dad's\n         gone too.\n\n    (Cody give Marahute an affectionate stroke;  as they fix the covering on\n    the eggs, the wind picks up and blows a feather in Cody's face; he looks\n    at it, plays with it, and puts it back.  Marahute picks it up and gives\n    it to Cody and he gives her a hug.)\n\n    (Marahute and Cody are now on the ground; Marahute takes off and Cody\n    runs around making flying noises)\n\n(scene:  just inside the forest.  A wanted poster of McLeach is posted on a\n         tree; A mouse is tied up with a bell attached to it that rings as\n         it struggles; Cody hears the bell and goes over to the mouse.)\n\nCody:    Heh heh... hey little fella, what happened to you?\n\nBaitmouse:    (panicking) Oh no! No, no, no, no!!  Get away, get away! It's a\n              trap, it's a trap.  Be careful, NO!\n\nCody:    (as the mouse is speaking) Don't worry, I'll get you loose.  Woah!\n         (Cody falls into the trap.  He looks up to see a blinking light\n         and the alarm.)\n\n(scene:  McLeach's truck; the radar has a blip on the screen.)\n\nMcLeach: (laughs)  Got one!!\n\n(scene:  back in the hole/trap where Cody has fallen.)\n\nBaitmouse:    (from the top of the hole) Are you alright?\n\nCody:    (rubbing his head) Yeah, I think so.\n\nBaitmouse:    Okey-dokey. (he runs off)\n\nCody:    Wait!  Hey!  Come back!\n\n    (Cody tries to climb out; he gets halfway up, grabs a tree root; it\n    breaks and he falls; the baitmouse begins to lower a vine down to help\n    Cody)\n\nBaitmouse:    Here you go, grab on.\n\nCody:    That's great, just a little more, a little further... there!  I\n         got it.\n\n    (a rumble is heard and the ground begins to shake.)\n\nBaitmouse:    Uh-oh.\n\n    (view of McLeach's vehicle trampling through the forest disturbing\n    everything)\n\nBaitmouse:    Yipe!\n\n    (The vine is severed as McLeach's truck comes to a screeching halt; Cody\n    falls; the truck opens; Joanna leans over pit and growls; Cody yells)\n\nMcLeach: (unseen, approaching the trap) Well Joanna, what'd we get today?\n         A dingo, a fat ol' razorback, or a nice big.... (he sees Cody)\n         boy?!?\n\n    (McLeach thinks for a second, gives a dirty look to Joanna and kicks\n    her.)\n         Joanna, you been diggin' holes out here again??  (mumbling to\n         himself) Dumb lizard always tryin' to bury squirrels out here.\n\nCody:    Unh-unh.  It's a trap, and poachin's against the law.\n\nMcLeach: Trap?!  Where'd you get an idea like that??  Boy I think you've\n         been down in that hole for too long.  (he holds his gun out so\n         that Cody can grab it) Well c'mon, grab ahold.  We'll get you out\n         of this little ol' lizard hole and you can just run along home.\n\n    (Joanna has spotted the baitmouse on Cody's backpack.  She hisses and\n    makes a face.)\n\nCody:    This IS a poacher's trap and YOU'RE a poacher.\n\n    (The mouse ducks back into the backpack; Joanna jumps on Cody, knocking\n    McLeach into the hole; his gun goes off; Joanna begins to attach Cody's\n    backpack.)\n\n         (to Joanna) Let go!!  Hey get off of me!!\n\nMcLeach: I'm gonna kill her.  (climbing out of the hole) I'm gonna kill\n         that dumb, slimey, egg-sucking salamander.\n\nCody:    Cut it out!  Get off of me!\n\n    (Joanna continues to attack the backpack; McLeach picks up his gun; he\n    points it at Joanna; looking through gun scope McLeach aims at Joanna,\n    she tries to get out of his view; as she does this, McLeach spots the\n    feather in Cody's pack; he picks up Cody by his backpack.)\n\nMcLeach: Hmmm.... good girl Joanna.  (Joanna looks up and grins happily.)\n\n         (to Cody) Say where'd you get this pretty feather boy?\n\nCody:    (humbly) It was a present.\n\nMcLeach: (coddling) Oh, that's real nice.  Who gave it to ya?\n\nCody:    (stumbling) It's a s... secret.\n\nMcLeach: That's no secret boy, you see, (menacing) I already got the\n         father.  (makes a cutting sound and draws a feather across his\n         neck like he was slashing a throat).  He, he he.  You just tell me\n         where momma and those little eggs are.\n\n    (Cody breaks free from McLeach by slipping out of his backpack.)\n\nCody:    NO!!\n\nMcLeach: Joanna, sick 'em!\n\n    (Cody runs through forest with Joanna close behind; he enters an open\n    area where we see a waterfall and water; Cody stops right at the edge of\n    the small cliff that drops into the water (Crocodile Falls); Joanna\n    follows close behind; Cody reaches into his pocket and pulls out his\n    knife; he drops it; McLeach steps on his hand.)\n\nMcLeach: You're comin' with me boy.\n\nCody:    My mom'll call the rangers!\n\nMcLeach: (sarcastically)  Oh no.... not the rangers, what'll I do??\n         What'll I do??!  Don't let your mom call the rangers!!  Please\n         don't!!  (Joanna laughs) (McLeach laughs)  (McLeach throws Cody's\n         backpack into the river)  My poor baby boy got eaten by the\n         crocodiles, boo-hoo-hoo!  Let's go boy!\n\nCody:    (from inside McLeach's cage)  Help!  Help!\n\n    (The baitmouse sees Cody in the cage; he runs to the local RAS telegraph\n    office; it begins to rain and wind is blowing; he bursts through the\n    door as the telegraph mouse is eating.)\n\nBaitmouse:  (very fast and excited) Help, help, help!!  Someone help!  McLeach\n            took the boy.  He took the little boy.  Send for help!!\n\n    (The telegraph mouse begins typing the message in morse code; camera\n    pans up to roof, where other mice aim the antenna; message is seen being\n    relayed to the Marshall Islands)\n\n    (In a wrecked plane on the Marshall Islands, a mouse listens to the\n    morse code message; he recognizes the distress call, activates the\n    controls on the plane, and relays message to Hawaii.)\n\n    (Message is seen being relayed to Hawaii.  Screens fill with RAS RAS\n    RAS.  Mice are watching through binoculars in the back.  The send a\n    signal to other mice.  They dial the phone to distract guard.  Phone\n    rings.  Guard leaves.  Mice take over, type (jump) on keyboard and read\n    message.  \"RAS... RAS... ATTENTION BOY KIDNAPPED IN AUSTRALIA IMMEDIATE\n    ACTION REQUIRED\"  They type \"Relay to New York\".)\n\n    (Message then journeys across the ocean to Los Angeles, then to Denver,\n    St. Louis, Chicago, Washington D. C. and then New York.)\n\n(scene:  It is winter in New York; through the clouds, the camera descends\n         upon the UN building; a mouse is listening to the transmission at\n         the RAS headquarters in New York)\n\nMouse:   Code red, code red!!  Attention all Rescue Aid Society delegates,\n         all delegates please report immediately to the main assembly hall.\n         This is an emergency meeting.  I repeat, this is a code red\n         emergency meeting!!\n\n    (the delegates have been assembling as the announcement was being made)\n\n(scene:  inside the RAS meeting hall)\n\nChairmouse:   Order!  Order!  Yes, yes I know it's late but I'm... oh really!\n            Sir Charles.  Hello, hello Frank, how are you, nice to see you!\n            And Esmerelda, there you are!  Ha ha.. all right, quiet now\n            please, everyone pay attention.  There has been a kidnapping in\n            Australia.  (delegates gasp)  A young boy needs our help.  This is\n            a mission requiring our very finest, and I know we are all\n            thinking of the same two mice.  (everyone looks to the seats of\n            Hungary and USA, which are empty)  (delegates gasp again.)  What's\n            this?!?  Gone?  We must find Bernard and Miss Bianca at once!\n\n(scene:  a posh restaurant)\n\n    (as a waiter walks by a pillar/column in the restaurant, a pea drops on\n    the floor; a cricket comes out of the column and picks it up.)\n\nCricket: Oh.... pea soup.\n\n    (With an elaborate contraption, he launches the pea up the column where\n    it drops into a thimble-pot of the cook)\n\nCricket cook: Pea soup!\n\n    (A waiter cricket comes along and picks up the soup; the scene changes\n    to the chandelier over the restaurant and we see a mini-restaurant above\n    the real one.)\n\nBianca:  To my dear Bernard, and our wonderful partnership.\n\nBernard: (nervous and fumbling) Ah... yeah.. yeah.. ah.. won... wonderful.\n\nBianca:  You've been very quiet this evening, is there something on your\n         mind?\n\nBernard: Well, ummm... actually... I, ah... I was wondering.... (he reaches\n         into his pocket.)\n\nBianca:  Yes darling?\n\nBernard: I... Miss Bianca would you.... would you... (the ring falls\n         through a hole in Bernard's pocket onto the floor) would you\n         excuse me for a minute?\n\n    (Bernard chases the ring across the floor; he crawls around, sees it,\n    and just as he goes to grab it, a waiter kicks it under another table;\n    Francois arrives at their table.)\n\nFrancois:     (French accent) Pardonnez moi, mademoiselle Bianca, I have\n              important news.  (He hands her a piece of paper.)\n\nBianca:  Yes Francois?  What is it?\n\nFrancois:     You and Bernard have been asked to accept a dangerous mission to\n              Australia.\n\nBianca:  (reading message) Oh the poor boy.  This is dreadful.  Now where\n         is Bernard I must tell him at once!\n\nFrancois:     Allow me madame, I will tell him immediately.\n\n    (Bernard is seen under a table retrieving ring; the ring finds its way\n    onto the foot of a rather large woman mouse who is having dinner with a\n    rather nerdy looking man mouse; as Bernard removes the ring from her\n    foot, she think the man mouse is playing footsie with her and smacks the\n    man mouse.)\n\nBernard: (practicing)  Miss Bianca, will you marry me?  Miss Bianca, will\n         you please marry me?\n\nFrancois:     (as Bernard practices) Quickly monsieur Bernard!  I must speak\n              with you....\n\nBernard: Not now Francois, I'm busy!\n\nFrancois:     No, no, no, no, monsieur you don't......\n\n    (As Francois attempts to follow Bernard he collides with another cricket\n    watier and falls on his back; various crickets run to help him.)\n\n    (Bernard returns to the table)\n\nBianca:  Bernard, did you talk to Francois?\n\nBernard: Ah yes, but uh.. there's... there's something I want ......\n\nBianca:  I know exactly what you're going to say.  Francois told me all\n         about it.\n\nBernard: He did?  How, how... how did he ...\n\nBianca:  Oh it doesn't matter, I think it's a marvelous idea.\n\nBernard: (shocked) You do?  I mean, you... you really want to?\n\nBianca:  I don't think it's a matter of wanting, it's a matter of duty.\n\nBernard: D-duty?  I... I never thought of it, well, umm... all righ.... all\n         right.  How does... how does next ah-April sound to you?\n\nBianca:  Heavens no!  We must act immediately, tonight!  (she leaves the\n         restaurant with Bernard close behind)\n\nBernard: Tonight?  But, but, ah.. wait!  Uh, Bianca, this is so sudden, I\n         mean, don't you at least need a gown or something?\n\nBianca:  No, just a pair of khaki shorts and some hiking boots!\n\nBernard: Hiking boots?\n\n(scene:  in the RAS meeting hall)\n\nChairmouse:   Ah, there you are, come along, come along.\n\nBianca:  Delegates, we have an important announcement.  Bernard and I have\n         decided, (pause) to accept the mission to Australia.\n\nBernard: (surprised)  Australia?\n\nChairmouse:   Oh good show!  Now, you must fly out immediately!  It's a little\n              nippy outside, but we won't let that stop us, will we?  What?\n              (laughs)\n\n(scene:  on top of a building, snow and wind blowing all around)\n\nBernard: (yelling) Miss Bianca, I'm not sure it's such a good idea to... to\n         fly this soon after eating!\n\nBianca:  Darling you'll be just fine!\n\nBernard: But aren't, aren't you supposed to wait 45 minutes?\n\nBianca:  (annoyed) Oh, just knock on the door and see if Orville is there!!\n\nBernard: (knocks slightly)  (quickly) Well, nobody's home, let's go.\n\n    (Bernard gets buried with snow)\n\nBianca:  Bernard!!  (scodling) This is no time to play in the snow.\n\nBernard: I wasn't playing in the snow.  It... it was an avalanche.\n\nBianca:  Oh look Bernard!   (reading the sign) Under new management, see\n         Wilbur.  C'mon darling, let's get a move out!\n\n(scene:  inside Wilbur's hangar; Wilbur is seen singing and dancing along\n         with some music)\n\nBianca:  Yoo-hoo!  Mr. Wilbur!  Hello?\n\nBernard: Look out!!  Excuse me!\n\nBianca:  Bernard DO something!  He can't hear us!\n\n    (Bernard \"struggles\" to get to the boom box and Wilbur continues to\n    dance.)\n\nWilbur:  (singing) The girls all look (music stops) when I go by..... Hey,\n         who killed the music?!?\n\nBernard: That's better.\n\nBianca:  Excuse us for interrupting, we're from the Rescue Aid Society.  I\n         am Miss Bianca...\n\nWilbur:  (interrupting) Miss Bianca!?!\n\nBianca:  and this is my....\n\nWilbur:  (still interrupting) THE Miss Bianca?  I don't believe it.  My\n         brother Orville told me ALL about you, oh boy, I... this is an\n         honor to have.... may I just say enceinte senorita to you?  May I?\n         (kisses her hand)\n\nBernard: Ahem.  (deliberately) We need to charter a flight.\n\nWilbur:  Well, you've come to the right place, buddy boy, welcome to\n         (pause) \"Albatross Air\"  -  a fair fare from here to there.\n         (laughs)  Get it?  A fair fare?  It's a... a play on... nevermind,\n         I've got tons of exotic destinations, far away places, custom\n         designed for (in a seductive voice) \"romantic weekend getaways\".\n         (laughs)  As well as the finest in-flight accomodations.  Speaking\n         of which, what can I get ya?  (fumbles, searches through his\n         cooler)  How about a nice mango-Maui cooler?  Very, very nice,\n         very tasty....\n\nBianca:  No thank you...\n\nWilbur:  Or a ah..... (fumbles about) Coconut guava nectar?  It's\n         carbonated.  Very nice.  I got little umbrellas for each one of\n         them and a little coconut thing....\n\nBianca:  No, it's urgent that we leave immediately!\n\nWilbur:  (disappointed)  Nothing?  Nothing at all?\n\nBernard: (dismayed) Wilbur.\n\nWilbur:  How about a cream soda?\n\nBernard: Now look, we need a flight to Australia.\n\nWilbur:  Australia?  The Land Down Under?  That's a fabulous idea!  So when\n         can I pencil you in?  Ah... after spring thaw?  You know, mid-June\n         would be very nice.\n\nBianca:  Oh know, we must leave TONIGHT.\n\nWilbur:  (spits out his drink) TONIGHT?  (coughs and laughs) C'mon you're\n         kiddin' me right?  (laughs) Have you looked outside?  (he opens\n         the window) It's suicide out there!  Oh-ho, oh no.  OH NO....I'm\n         afraid your jolly little holiday will have to wait.  (laughs)\n         What a bunch of jokers.\n\nBianca:  But you don't understand, a boy needs our help, he's in trouble.\n\nWilbur:  A boy?  You mean, a little kid kinda boy?\n\nBianca:  He was kidnapped.\n\nWilbur:  Kidnapped?  (remorseful) Aw... that... that's awful.  Lockin' up a\n         little kid.  A kid should be free.  Free to run wild through the\n         house on Saturday mornings, (gathering strength) free to have\n         cookies and milk, and get those little white moustaches, you know,\n         with the..... (determined) NOBODY'S gonna take a kid's freedom\n         away while I'm around, nobody, do you hear me?!?\n\nBianca:  Does that mean you'll take us?\n\nWilbur:  (with conviction) Storm or no storm, Albatross Airlines, at your\n         service!! (Wilbur salutes)\n\n    (scene changes to Bernard and Bianca on Wilbur's back)\n\n         Passengers are requested to please fasten their seat belts and\n         secure all carry-ons.  We'll be departing following our standard\n         pre-flight maintenance.  Thank you.\n\n    (Wilbur begins to exercise)\n\n         Yeah, loosen up, get the blood flowin' up to the head, annnnnd,\n         couple of these....oh!  (tries to do a push-up) O.k.  one's\n         enough, here we go.  Oh!  Ah yeah!!  That feels better.  Oh baby.\n         Tie your kangaroos down sports fans, here, we, COME!\n\n    (opens hangar doors, gets blown back by wind)\n\n         Yeah, let's go for it!!  Woah!  Hey!  Woah!  Hey, I didn't adjust\n         for the winds.  All right we're gonna make it!!  I just gotta duck\n         down a little lower, that's all.    Go under the wind, go under\n         it!  Here we go (screams)!!  Ow this is cold!  Slippery!  Ice!\n         Ice!  We got ice!  We got ice!  Oh hang on now!!  Here we go!\n         Here we go!  Here we go!!!  HERE WE GO!!  COWABUNGA!!!!!!!\n\n    (Wilbur dives for the street; \"flies\" just in time to miss the ground.)\n\nBianca:  Captain, is this a non-stop flight to Australia??\n\nWilbur:  Well, ah...not exactly no, I could definitely say no.  We're gonna\n         have to make connections with a bigger bird.  (aside)  Non-stop?\n         What do I look like, Charles Lindburgh??\n\n(scene:  McLeach driving his vehicle with Cody in the cage in the\n         Australian outback.)\n\nCody:    (pounding on the cage) Lemme outta here!!  Lemme go!!  You can't\n         do this!!  Help!  Help!  Help!\n\nMcLeach: (on speaker)  Breaker, breaker, little mate.  I forgot to tell ya\n         around here, you need to be QUIET!!  (Cody trips)  Or the rangers\n         might hear ya.  Now sit down and relax, enjoy the view.  (laughs)\n         Nothin' but abandoned opal mines as far as the eye can see.  And\n         dead ahead, is home sweet home.  (begins singing) (from a\n         distance) Home, home on the range.  Where the critters are tied up\n         in chains.  I cut through their sides, and I rip off their hides.\n         And the next day I do it again.  Everybody!  Home, home on the\n         range.....\n\n(scene:  long shot of Cody's house)\n\nMom:     Cody!  Cody!  Cody!\n\n(scene:  cargo hold of airplane; Wilbur, Bernard, and Miss Bianca are\n         sleeping on an airplane tire.)\n\nAnnouncer:    (heard from inside of plane)  Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 is\n         now approaching Sydney airport, make sure you pick up your parcels\n         and packages and enjoy your stay in Australia.\n\n    (Miss Bianca wakes up, gives Bernard a kiss to wake him up.)\n\nBernard: (just waking up) (yawns) Are we there yet?\n\nBianca:  Yes.  You know, perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.\n\nBernard: Oh, oh... alright, I'll get him up.  (leaning over)  Ahhh...\n         Wilbur?  (Wilbur is snoring)  Wilbur?  Wilbur??\n\nWilbur:  (half awake) Um, yeah, just five more minutes ma.  (Wilbur rolls\n         over, trapping Bernard and Bianca)\n\nBianca and Bernard:     (screams) Wilbur!!\n\nWilbur:  (groggy) That's all I need, five more minutes.\n\nBianca:  (pleading) Wilbur??  Are you awake??\n\nBernard: Get, get up we're there!!\n\nWilbur:  O.k. I'm up, I'm up. (he rolls back over)\n\nBernard: Watch out you got....\n\nWilbur:  (groans)  Oh!  I must'a been sleepin' on a bolt.  Ooo.  (plane\n         body opens)  Oh boy.  Throw another shrimp on the barbie girls,\n         cause HERE I COME!!\n\nBernard: Here we go again!!\n\nWilbur:  CANNONBALL!!!!!\n\nBianca:  Weeee!!\n\n    (Wilbur \"cannonballs\" out of the airplane; he runs into a flock of\n    seagulls on his way down and passes the Sydney Opera House.)\n\nWilbur:  Gang way!  Comin' through, mice on board!!  Clear the way!  Move\n         over madam, there you go!  Comin' through sir, thank you.\n         (laughs)  Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.  Did we lose anyone back\n         there?  (laughs).\n\nBernard: Miss Bianca, from.. from now on, can't... can't we just take the\n         train?\n\n(scene:  Mugwomp flats \"control tower\".  Jake and Sparky are playing\n         checkers.)\n\nJake:    Well Sparky, you've had this comin' for a long time.  And now,\n         you're gonna get it.  Ha!\n\n    (Jake jumps one of Sparky's pieces; Sparky spits and then jumps a bunch\n    of Jake's pieces.)\n\nJake:    Hmmm... wise fly.  (Sparky laughs)\n\nWilbur:  (over radio)  Mugwomp tower, Mugwomp tower, this is Albatross One\n         Three requesting permission to land.  Over?\n\nJake:    Albatross?  (Jake flips over the checkerboard to a chart that has\n         various bird sizes)  Let's see... finch, wren, scrub bird,\n         lockeet, freckled duck, culah, kukaberra, parrot, cockatoo,\n         alba... alba...?!?!  It's a jumbo!!\n\n         (into radio)  Negative one three, you'll have to turn back, our\n         runway isn't long enough for a bird your size.\n\nWilbur:  Not long enough?!?  Look pal, I can land this thing on a dime!\n\nBernard: (heard over radio) Uh... Wilbur, if, if the runway isn't long\n         enough...\n\nWilbur:  Listen you can't let these radar jockeys push you around.  Just\n         leave it to me alright?\n\nJake:    (into radio) I say again mate, our runway is too short.\n\nWilbur:  And I say again, MATE, I'm comin' in!!\n\nJake:    Crazy Yank.  Quick Sparky, we gotta find a way to extend the\n         runway.\n\n    (Jake and Sparky begin to make the runway longer; Jake kicks a cinder\n    block raising part of the roof.)\n\nWilbur:  Here we go!\n\nBernard: We..., we'll never make it!!\n\nWilbur:  (as he bounces along roof)  Hot!  Oooh!  Ow!  Passengers please\n         remain seated until the aircraft comes to a full and complete\n         stop.  Thank you.\n\n    (Jake and Sparky continue to extend the runway; Wilbur lands on an\n    umbrella and spins around.)\n\nJake:    Quick Sparky, we need to make a drag line!\n\n    (an elaborate clothesline/hangar/brassiere drag line is constructed;\n    Wilbur is catapulted into the drag line; when he stops, he is \"wearing\"\n    the bra.)\n\nWilbur:  (cocky) Don't try and tell ME the runway's too short.  Ha!  (to\n         Jake) Hold this for me will ya pal?  (Wilbur \"hands\" him the bra\n         which launches Jake backwards.)\n\nJake:    Bloke oughtta have his wings clipped.\n\nWilbur:  You captain thanks you for flying Albatross Airlines.....\n\nJake:    (aside to Sparky) Crazy Yanks.  They think they can do any fool\n         thing, without regard for.....\n\n    (he sees Bianca; becomes starry-eyed; Sparky wonders what happened;\n    looks at Jake; Sparky buzzes in dismay)\n\n         (being suave) Welcome to Australia ma'am.  My name's Jake and if\n         there's any way I can make your stay more pleasant, don't hesitate\n         to ask.\n\nBianca:  Oh, how kind.\n\nJake:    Allow me to get that bag for ya.\n\nBernard: (struggling)  I've a.... I've got a lot of... luggage here...\n\nWilbur:  Here let me give you a hand with those bags pal, all part of the\n         friendly service here at Albatross Air (Wilbur picks up two of the\n         bags; a crunch is heard)  Ow!  Oh!  Big time hurt!  Ah back!!  Oh\n         it's out!\n\nBianca:  Wilbur, are you alright?\n\nJake:    Don't worry ma'am, I'll handle this.  Sparky, you watch the tower,\n         we gotta get this bird to the hospital.\n\nWilbur:  Oh.... can't go down, can't go up.  Oh ! Take the bags, take the\n         bags!\n\n(scene:  an old military hospital vehicle.  Wilbur is being lowered inside\n         by a series of ropes, gears and nursemice.)\n\nNursemice:    Heave!  Ho!  Heave!  Ho!\n\nWilbur:  Hey, whaddya doin'?  Hey, what... what's going on?  Wait!  Hey\n         wait a minute... just stop everything.\n\nBianca:  Wilbur, don't worry.  We'll come back the moment we find the boy.\n\nWilbur:  (begging) Wait!  Hey!  Wait a minute!  Don't leave me here,\n         please!  I'm feeling much better now.  I'm even ready to hit the\n         beaches (laughs).  I'm even ready to mambo.  (Wiggles in the\n         restraints).\n\nBianca:  Doctor, will he be alright?\n\nDoctor:  (consoling) Now, now, my dear.  Keep a stiff upper lip.  They all\n         come in with a whimper, and leave with a grin.  Off with you now.\n         Leave everything to me.  Shoo, shoo, off you go.\n\n(they leave)\n\n         Hop to it ladies, we've got a bent bird on our hands.  Move, move,\n         move, bustle, bustle, bustle.  That's it, ah-ha.\n\nWilbur:  Will it, will it hurt doc?\n\nDoctor:  Dear boy, you won't feel a thing.  (to the nurse mice) Launch the\n         back brace!\n\n    (the \"back brace\" (a cane) is \"launched\" to immobilize Wilbur's back.)\n\nWilbur:  Hey!  Hey wait!  Wait!  Woah!! I've been skewered.\n\nDoctor:  (cross) I've already missed tea, Mr. Albatross, now don't force me\n         to take drastic measures.  You MUST relax.\n\nWilbur:  Relax?!?  I have never been more relaxed in my life!!  (begins to\n         get hyper) If I were any more relaxed, I'd be dead!!!\n\nDoctor:  (smug) I'm not convinced.  (to the nurse mice) Sixty milligrams!\n\nNursemice:    Sixty milligrams.\n\n    (the nursemice fill hypodermic needle with liquid and put it into the\n    chamber of a shotgun.)\n\nWilbur:  Hey... wha.... are... are you guys crazy?  You can't do that to\n         me!  I'm an American citizen buddy!!!\n\nDoctor:  Better double it!\n\nWilbur:  DOUBLE?!?\n\nNursemice:    Double, coming up! (they load up another needle in the other\n              chamber.)\n\nWilbur:  Nooo!!\n\nDoctor:  Prepare the albatross for medication.\n\nWilbur:  Oh, I'm dreamin'... I'm dreamin'!!  Come on Wilbur, wake up boy,\n         wake up!!\n\nDoctor:  (giving directions to aim the gun.) Three degrees right.\n\nWilbur:  Come on!!\n\nNursemice:    Three degrees right.\n\nWilbur:  Come on, it's a joke, it's a joke!\n\nDoctor:  Down two degrees.\n\nWilbur:  Oh no, don't go down two degrees!\n\nNursemice:    Down two degrees.\n\nDoctor:  Ready!\n\nWilbur:  No I'm not ready!!  No, please!!\n\nDoctor:  Aim!!\n\nWilbur:  (crying) please don't do this to me......\n\nDoctor:  FIRE!!\n\n    (the scene changes to outside and we hear the gun fire.)\n\nWilbur:  Ow, ow, oh. ooo......\n\n(scene:  Mugwomp Flats; Bernard and Bianca are looking at a map)\n\nBernard: Now we just.... gotta figure out how to get there.\n\nJake:    So, ah... you and your umm... husband here on a little outback\n         excursion?\n\nBianca:  Oh no, no, we're not married.\n\nBernard: In fact we're, we're here on a, a top ah.. secret mission.\n         Very... very.. hush, hush.\n\nJake:    Oh!  Gotta rescue that kid McLeach nabbed eh?\n\nBianca:  Why that's right!  How did you know?\n\nJake:    (he bumps Bernard out of the way) (whispering to Bianca) You'll\n         find it's tough to keep secrets in the outback miss.  (outloud)\n         So ah.... which way ya takin'?  (looking at Bernard's map.)\n         Suicide trail through Nightmare Canyon, or the shortcut at Satan's\n         ridge?\n\nBernard: Su... Suicide trail?\n\nJake:    Good choice.  (dramatically) More snakes, less quicksand.  Then\n         once you cross Bloodworm Creek, you're scot free, this is until\n         ummm... Dead Dingo Pass.\n\nBernard: (puzzled) Wait, wait, wait a minute, I don't.... I don't see any,\n         any of that, that stuff on the map.\n\nJake:    A map's no good in the outback!  (folding up the map)  What you\n         really need is someone, (schmoozing to Bianca) someone who KNOWS\n         the territory.\n\nBianca:  Oh Mister Jake, will you guide us?\n\nJake:    At your service!  (he bows and shoves the map behind him into\n         Bernard's gut.)  Here better take my arm miss it's gonna be a\n         treacherous hike.  (beginning to tell a story) I remember the time\n         Miss B. it was just me and four hundred of these big giant.....\n\nBernard: Doesn't even know how to fold a map....\n\n(scene:  the rangers are at Crocodile Falls searching the water; then we\n         see Bernard, Miss Bianca and Jake on a wombat in a tree getting\n         ready to jump.)\n\nJake:    This is how we get around in the outback Miss B.  (shouting)  The\n         only way to travel, eh Berno?\n\nBernard: Ah yeah, yeah, it's just a little, a little ah.. bumpy back here.\n\n    (Bernard is bobbing along on the tail; the wombat climbs to the top of\n    the tree and jumps.)\n\nJake:    Cinch up your seatbelts mates, we're comin' in for a landing.\n\n    (the wombat lands on a small bush; Jake and Miss Bianca get off the\n    wombat; however the bush isn't exactly stable yet...)\n\nBernard: Hold it, not, not yet!! (Bernard gets launched into a patch of\n         briars.)\n\n(scene:  McLeach's hideout)\n\nMcLeach: (sharpening a knife) Well boy, let's see if we can do something to\n         refresh that rusty old memory of yours.  Is she on Satan's Ridge?\n         (throws a knife at the map Cody is standing in front of) Or\n         Nightmare Canyon??  (throws another knife) Whadda you think\n         Joanna?  Yeah, that's it... right smack dab in the middle at Croc\n         Falls!  (throws another knife) (to Cody) Am I gettin' warm??\n\nCody:    I told you, I don't remember.\n\nMcLeach: Don't you realize a bird that size is worth a fortune??  (in\n         Cody's face) I'll split the money with you fifty-fifty, you can't\n         get a better offer than that boy.\n\nCody:    You won't have any money after the rangers get through with you.\n\nMcLeach: (growls in anger) (he kicks over the kettle of water in the fire).\n\n(scene:  Bernard and Bianca in the forest by the water; Bianca is removing\n         the burrs from Bernard.)\n\nBernard: Jake's been gone... ow.... been gone a long time... maybe I should\n         go, oh!  Maybe I should go look for him.\n\nBianca:  Oh don't you worry about Jake, he can handle himself.\n\nBernard: Yeah, I... I noticed.\n\nBianca:  I am just sure he'll be back in no time.\n\n    (Bernard reaches into his pocket and pulls out the ring to make sure\n    it's still there.)\n\nBernard: You know... now that we're alone, (nervous) there's... there's\n         something that I've, I've been wanting to uh... to.. to ask you.\n\nBianca:  Yes?  What is it?\n\nBernard: (he walks over to Bianca) Well, it's uh.... it's like this... Miss\n         Bianca I.... (he gets down on one knee) I would be... (he takes\n         her hand) most honored... if..  if...\n\nJake:    LOOK OUT!!!  (Jake bursts through the two of them; Bianca screams)\n         No mice for you Twister not today!!  (Jake proceeds to lasso the\n         mouth of Twister the snake.) There!\n\nBernard: Miss Bianca!\n\nJake:    (assertively) I've been looking all over for you.  Now look... we\n         got a long way to go, and you're gonna take us there, and you're\n         not gonna give us any trouble about it.  Right??\n\n    (Snake shakes his head no; Jake and Miss Bianca get on Twister.)\n\n         They're perfectly harmless once you look 'em in the eye and let\n         em' who's boss.  Ain't that right mate?  (smacks the snake.) Now\n         git.\n\nBianca:  It's alright Bernard, Jake has everything under control.\n\nBernard: (disappointed and sarcastic) Yeah, I noticed.\n\nJake:   (going into a story again) You know Miss Bianca, truth be told, I\n         used to be quite a dingo wrestler.  Yeah, there was this one time,\n         it was just me and (his voice begins to trail off) 300 of these\n         ferocious mouse-eating dingo's right... had me surrounded....\n         decided to ....\n\n    (Bernard, who is riding the end of the snake, get out the ring, dumps\n    out the water, and sighs.)\n\n(scene:  McLeach's animal prison; Mcleach throws Cody into a cage.)\n\nMcLeach: I'll give you a night down here to think it over.  But tomorrow,\n         no more Mr. Nice Guy.  (McLeach slams the door, Joanna gets her\n         tail caught in it.)  Joanna!  You thick-headed chunk of fish-bait!\n\nCody:    (yelling) I'll NEVER tell you where she is!  Never!  Never!\n\nFrank:   (mimicking Cody) Yeah, never tell!  You'll have to drag it out of\n         us!\n\nCody:    Hey, where did you come from?\n\nFrank:   Um... the desert?\n\nKrebbs:  Well, well, well, fancy that!  Looks likes McLeach has begun\n         trapping his own kind!  There's no hope for any of us now.\n\nFrank:   No hope!  No hope!  No! (cries)\n\nCody:    Be there MUST be a way out of here.\n\nKrebbs:  Oh, there's a way out all right.\n\nCody (and others): There is?\n\nKrebbs:  Absolutely.  (cocky) You'll go as a wallet, you'll go as a belt,\n         and our dear Frank....\n\nFrank:   No, no, no, I don't want to hear it.\n\nKrebbs:  Frank will go as......\n\nFrank:   I can't hear you... (Frank covers his ears and begins to sing a\n         nonsense version of the Australian national anthem) la la la la\n         la.....\n\nKrebbs:  (pause until Frank uncovers his ears) A purse.\n\nFrank:   Aiighh... no!! (cries)\n\nKrebbs:  Ooo... a lovely ladies' purse.\n\nFrank:   (crying) I don't want to go as a purse.  (begging) Please, please,\n         don't let 'em do it!\n\nCody:    Don't worry, we're gonna get out of here.\n\nFrank:   We are?\n\nCody:    Yeah!  If we all put our heads together, I'm sure we'll think of\n         something.\n\nFrank:   Yeah, something, something.... (begins to pant and think hard)\n\nCody:    Frank, what's wrong?\n\nKrebbs:  Oh, here he goes again.\n\nRed:     Take it easy mate, you don't want to hurt yourself again.\n\nFrank:   (straining to think) I got it!!  All we gotta do, is get the\n         keys!!\n\nKrebbs:  (sarcastically) Ohhh!! Is that all??  Well then, we better start\n         packing our bags.\n\nCody:    No wait, he's right.  If we could get these long pieces of\n         wood.... (Cody strains to reach some long pieces of wood through\n         his cage)\n\nFrank:   Wood, yeah, wood, wood, wood, yeah good.\n\nCody:    Maybe we could.... (a bird in a \"tire cage\" helps knock the wood\n         so Cody can reach it.)  that's right just a little more... there,\n         (he gets a piece of wood) Come on everybody, get some more stuff!!\n\nRed:     The kid's right, what are we waiting for?\n\nCody:    That's it, you've got it!  Hurry!  We need something to tie it\n         together!\n\nFrank:   Hey, hey, hey, whaddya got, whaddya got, whaddya got??  (Frank\n         gets whopped with a shoe) (through the shoe) Shoelaces!  Oh.\n\n    (the animals have constructed a long pole held up and together with rope\n    and shoelaces; they begin to use their \"pole\" to get the keys.)\n\nCody:    Almost.... a little further...\n\nFrank:   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  (Krebbs moans/cries as they miss the keys.)\n\nCody:    It's o.k. let's try again.\n\nFrank:   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nCody:    Easy... easy does it.\n\nFrank:   Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, no, yeah, yeah (etc...)\n\nKrebbs:  Somebody shut him up!!\n\n    (they get the keys on the hook; the dangle right in front of the door.)\n\nFrank:   You've got it! You've got it!  You've got it!\n\n    (Joanna comes in, discovers keys, destroys pole, returns keys to hook,\n    and leaves through the animal door.)\n\nFrank:   (Frank strains to think again) I've got it!  I'll just take my\n         tail.... and I'll pick the lock.... like this!!\n\nRed:     Aww Frank, give it a rest.\n\nFrank:   No, no, no!!  You'll thank me when you're free!  Look, look, look,\n         I just insert my tail, like this, and I turn it like this, just a\n         quarter turn to the left, and then push it a little bit\n         further...... (etc.)\n\n(scene change: Jake, Bianca, and Bernard are riding lightning bugs.)\n\nJake:    Ha, ha!!  Show him who's boss Berno!\n\n    (Bernard is having obvious trouble with his bug; he hits a dandelion,\n    attempts to sneeze, but goes underwater instead.)\n\n(scene:  the hospital wagon)\n\nWilbur:  Ugh... I feel like I got my head in a vise. (zoom out to see\n         Wilbur's head in a vise)  Unh...\n\nDoctor:  Are we ready nurse?\n\nNursemouse:   Ready doctor.\n\nDoctor:  Alright ladies, snap to it!  (he snaps his rubber gloves on)\n         Ooo... that smarts!  Ah... let me see here.... (hums/sings to\n         himself as he examines the x-ray)... forceps!\n\nNursemouse:   Forceps.\n\n    (various tools posing as surgical equipment are tossed around.)\n\nWilbur:  Oh no, what now? (in the background the heart monitor begins to\n         beep faster and faster throughout this part)\n\nDoctor:  Spinal stretch-u-lator.\n\nWilbur:  Oh... that's gonna hurt.\n\nDoctor:  Artery router.\n\nWilbur:  Mother!\n\nDoctor:  This is rusted tight.  I wouldn't DREAM of using such a tool.\n         Bring me the epidermal tissue disrupter! (which is actually a\n         chainsaw)\n\nWilbur:  The epidermal what?!?!  (realizing what it is.) Oh no... no....\n<b>         NO!\n</b>\n    (Wilbur screams and breaks free; the nursemice set off an alarm and sign\n    that says \"Patient Escaping.\")\n\nDoctor:  Mr. Albatross we haven't operated yet!\n\nWilbur:  You gotta catch me first doc!!\n\nDoctor:  Mr. Albatross, please!! (chasing Wilbur)\n\nWilbur:  Cowabunga!\n\nDoctor:  Mr. Albatross, we must return you to the operating room!\n\nWilbur:  You'll never take me alive!!  (Wilbur attempts to climb out a\n         window\n\nDoctor:  Please don't do this!!  Your spine needs tender... (scream)....\n         loving.... (scream).... care!  (they all fall backwards)\n\nWilbur:  Oh.  Ugh.  oh... oh... my... my back!  Hey, hey... I can, I, it\n         works!!  I'm cured!!\n\nDoctor:  My back!\n\n    (Wilbur bursts out of the back of the hospital truck)\n\nWilbur:  Don't worry, I'm coming you little mice... this is the finest\n         fleet on two webbed feet.  (panting)  Oh boy, I gotta, I gotta go\n         on a diet when I get home.  Here we go!!\n\n(scene: Cody's house)\n\n    (a ranger knocks at the door; Cody's mom answers and we begin to hear\n    the radio announcer in the background)\n\nAnnouncer: ... those particular areas, in other news, authorities in Mugwomp\n         Flats have called off the search for the missing boy.  His\n         backpack was found near Crocodile Falls, and local rangers believe\n         he was yet another victim of crocodile attack.\n      (scene transitions to McLeach's hideout)\n         Authorities once again warn residents to use extreme caution when\n         they are....\n\nMcLeach: (to the radio) Ha heh!  Think you're pretty smart, don't you eh?\n         Who outsmarted who?  Who?  Who outsmarted who?  I still gotta get\n         that boy, to talking, huh?  (a thought strikes him) I'm hungry.\n         Can't think on an empty stomach... gotta have protein... gotta\n         have.... eggs.  (Joanna perks up at the word \"eggs\").\n\n    (McLeach gets up and walks across the room; Joanna follows.)\n\n         Everyone's got his price... all I gotta do is offer him whatever\n         he wants... and then not give it to him.\n\n    (Joanna opens the tool box, takes an egg and puts it in her mouth;\n    throughout this scene, Joanna steals McLeach's eggs as he is talking out\n    loud; he keeps moving the box back and forth in an attempt to stop her,\n    which only makes matters worse.)\n\n         (to Joanna) Did you take one of my eggs?  Open your mouth.  These\n         are NOT Joanna eggs.  Let's see ummm... the boy's got the eagle...\n         I want the eagle... the boy won't give me the eagle... if I could\n         just find the boy's weak spot, I could get him to tell me where\n         the eagle is.  But the boy's only got ONE weak spot, and that IS\n         the eagle.  (aside/thinking out loud) Maybe if I stuck him in a\n         giant anthill, that would loosen his tongue and then.... (yells) I\n         got it!  (to Joanna)  Got your hand caught in the cookie jar,\n         didn't ya?  Eh?  Who do you think you're messin' with you dumb\n         animal, my mental facilities are twice what yours are, you\n         peabrain.  (opens case, realizes all the eggs are gone)  (calmy at\n         first, then more angry) (Joanna runs away and hides) Joanna.... I\n         give you platypus eggs, I give you snake eggs, why I'll even give\n         you eagle eggs, but I want you to stay away from my... (stops\n         abruptly).... (whispers) the eagle's eggs!  That's it!  That's the\n         boy's weak spot!  (Joanna whimpers in corner)\n\n(scene: McLeach's animal prison)\n\nFrank:   (still trying to open lock with his tail).  Push it in a little\n         bit farther..... (mumbling).... (Frank opens the cage without\n         realizing it and steps out.) (crying) I give up!  (kicks the door\n         closed) I'll never get this.... we're doomed!  Doomed!\n\nRed:     Hey look!  Krebbs, Frank's out!\n\nCody:    Frank, Frank, you're free!\n\nFrank:   Free?!  (realizing) I'm free!  I'm free!  I'm free!  I'm free!....\n         (continues)\n\nRed:     Shhhhh!!! Joanna'll hear!\n\nKrebbs:  Double or nothin' he's caught in five minutes.\n\nCody:    Calm down little mate.\n\nFrank:   (sticks his head through the cage) Look at me, I'm free!\n\nCody:    Frank, get the keys.\n\nFrank:   I should get the keys.  I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck....\n         (continues and struggles)\n\nRed:     Shhh quiet!\n\nKrebbs:  Quiet ya fool!\n\nCody:    Take it easy, I'll get you loose.  (twists Frank back through the\n         cage) There ya go.  (deliberately) Now go get the keys.\n\nFrank:   The keys.  Yeah, yeah, keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.  (jumps to\n         grab keys and misses) Gee, I can't reach 'em.\n\nCody:    Quick, get something to stand on.\n\nFrank:   Yeah, stand on, something to stand on.\n\nKrebbs:  This oughtta be rich.\n\nFrank:   Yeah, yeah, stand on, stand on.... (etc.)\n\n    (Frank gets a flat board, carries it across, throws it on the ground,\n    thereby increasing his height by .01 inches.)\n\nEveryone:     FRANK!\n\nCody:    Use the box!  Climb up on the box!\n\nFrank:   (mumbles) (grunts) box, box..... etc.\n\n    (Frank moves the box, climbs up, and grabs the keys; he falls over with\n    them on top of the box which makes noise with them)\n\nEverybody:    SHHHHH!  Quiet!\n\nFrank:   (grumbles) These are heavy!\n\n    (Frank kicks the keys onto the floor; everyone is dismayed.  Frank gets\n    a grip, gets quiet, and goes down to get the keys quietly.  As he goes\n    to grab the keys, Joanna enters the prison room through the animal\n    door.)\n\n         Oops!\n\n    (Joanna begins to chase Frank around the room)\n\nRed:     The keys Frank, give us the keys!!  Frank, over here!!  Give us\n         the keys!!  (they disappear behind some junk; Frank emerges riding\n         Joanna like a horse with the keys as a bridle) Yeeeeeee-haaaww,\n         ride 'em Frank!!!!\n\nFrank:   Ya-hoo, howdy, howdy, howdy!!!!  Howdy, howdy, howdy!!!  (Joanna\n         launches Frank across the room) Yeah, yeah, .... (etc) ....\n\n    (Frank drops the keys; Cody picks them up and lets himself out.)\n\n    (Joanna runs after Frank towards the cage) Let me in!  Let me in!!\n\n    (Joanna gets a gun) No, no, no!!!! (etc.)\n\n    (Joanna shoots the gun at Frank who is standing against a wall.  He is\n    in a fancy position.)\n\n         Huh, missed.\n\nMcLeach: (catching Cody with the keys) Surprise!!  If I didn't know any\n         better, I'd think you didn't like it here.\n\nCody:    Let me go, let go, let go!!!!\n\nMcLeach: (sees Frank out of his cage) HA!!  Whaddya you doin' out of your\n         cage?!?  (Frank goes back into his cage.) Uhhh.... that's better.\n         C'mon boy, (laughs) say goodbye to your little friends.... it's\n         the last you'll ever see of 'em.\n\n(scene: at the front of McLeach's hideout)\n\nBianca:  There is no time to waste.  We MUST try to get in.\n\nBernard: (handing her a stick) Here, here Miss Bianca, start digging.\n\nJake:    (half-heartedly digs for a moment, stops, looks up and laughs)\n         (sarcastically) Has anyone considered trying... \"open sesame\"?\n\nBianca and Bernard:     Aiighh!  Woah!\n\nJake:    (shocked) Hey it worked!!\n\n    (the mice climb up over the open door and look down.)\n\nMcLeach: (throwing Cody out) Get out of here!!  Go on!  Git!!\n\nBianca:  Look Bernard, it's the boy!\n\nJake:    And McLeach.\n\nMcLeach: (throwing Cody's knife at Cody's feet) It's all over boy... your\n         bird's dead.  Someone shot her... shot her, right outta the sky,\n         bang!!  (Joanna mocks a shot and death.)\n\nCody:    NO!!\n\nMcLeach: Whaddya mean 'no'?  You callin' me a liar?  I heard it on the\n         radio this morning, and she could have been mine if it weren't for\n         you, now you better git outta here, before I change my mind.  Go\n         on, git!!\n\nBernard: (whispering) Why is he letting him go??\n\nJake:    It's gotta be a trick.\n\nMcLeach: (aside to Joanna, but loud enough for Cody to hear) Too bad about\n         those eggs, eh Joanna?  They'll never survive without their\n         mother.  Oh well, survival of the fittest, I guess.  (watches Cody\n         run off) (whispers)  Bingo!  (laughs) (Joanna also laughs)\n\nBianca:  Bird?\n\nBernard: Eggs?\n\nJake:    Shh!  Listen.\n\n    (McLeach pulls out his truck with himself and Joanna in the cab.)\n\nMcLeach: (laughs) I didn't make it all the way through third grade for\n         nothing.\n\n    (McLeach's truck begins to leave.)\n\nJake:    I don't know where he's going, but he can't let him get away.\n         Hurry up you two!! (he jumps onto the truck.)\n\nBianca:  Quickly Bernard, NOW!!\n\n    (They all jump; Bianca and Bernard miss and slide down onto the treads)\n\nBernard: Oh no!! Oh no!!  Get between the treads!!\n\nJake:    (throwing a rope) Bernard!! Bianca!!  Here, catch!!\n\nBernard: Got it!!  Miss, Miss, Miss Bianca, you, you can do it!!!\n\n(scene: in the sky)\n\nWilbur:  (panting and puffing)  Boy, this is some headwind, huh?  Say,\n         (laughs), you lovely ladies wouldn't have seen two little mice\n         running around down there, would ya?  Hey where ya going?  I mean\n         it, I'm looking for two little mice!  (aside) Is it something I\n         said?\n\n(scene: at the cliff)\n\n    (Cody runs to the edge, stops, looks down, and begins to climb down.)\n\nJake:    He's going down the cliff!  C'mon, we gotta warn him!\n\n(scene:  over the cliff; at Marahute's nest.)\n\n    (Cody arrives at the nest; sees the eggs; checks them out; he covers\n    them up, and places one of the golden feathers on them.)\n\nBianca:  Cody!\n\nCody:    Huh?  Who are you?\n\nBianca:  Oh, there is no time to explain, you're in GREAT danger.\n\nCody:    (Marahute's screech is heard at a distance) Marahute?!  It can't be!\n\nBianca:  Oh Cody, Cody wait!!\n\nCody:    (sees Marahute) She's alive!!\n\nBianca:  Cody please!!  You MUST listen!!\n\nBernard: That's right, Mc.. McLeach is on the cliff.\n\nCody:    (looks up and sees McLeach's truck) (begins to yell and plead)\n         Marahute, NO!!!  Turn back!!  Turn back!!  Stay away!!  It's a\n         trap!!\n\n    (McLeach launches the trap; Marahute is caught in it.)\n\nMcLeach: I got her!!!  I got her!!!  Did you see that?  (laughs)  Perfect\n         shot!! Per-fect shot!  She's mine!!  (laughs)  All mine!!!!\n\nCody:    NO!!!\n\n    (Cody jumps for the trap/bundle as it is hoisted up; Jake lassos Cody's\n    foot.)\n\nJake:    Hold tight you two, we're going for a ride!\n\n    (Bernard misses the rope)\n\nBernard: Bianca!!\n\nBianca:  Bernard!\n\n    (Cody begins to cut the ropes on the trap.)\n\nMcLeach: (grumbles)... Meddlin' brat.  Gonna get rid of him for good.\n\n    (McLeach tries to shake Cody off.)\n\nCody:    Help I'm slipping!\n\nBianca:  Cody, don't move!!\n\n    (Jake throws a rope and lassos Cody's foot.)\n\nMcLeach: (hoists the whole group up and drops them into his cage) (laughs)\n         (whispering)  There she is Joanna.... just look at her.... look at\n         the size of her... the RAREST bird in the world.  That bird's\n         gonna make me rich... (chuckles) FILTHY rich.  (laughs)\n         (announcing) I got what I want.  Now, what does Joanna want?  Does\n         she wanna make sure that bird... STAYS rare?  (egging her on) How\n         about some great, big, triple A, jumbo, eagle eggs!!!  Eh?!  You\n         want 'em?!  Eh?!  You want 'em?  Go get 'em girl!!\n\nCody:    NO!!  Please!!\n\n    (Joanna runs for the cliff, sees how far down it is and balks in fear.)\n\nMcLeach: (mocking) Why, whatever is the matter Joanna??  (She points down;\n         McLeach kicks her over the edge).  Git!!\n\n    (Joanna goes down to eat the eggs; she searches the nest for them; finds\n    the eggs; takes a bite of one; it is rock hard; she tries another with\n    the same result; she drops one egg on the other which lands on her tail\n    and she shreiks in pain)\n\n         (screaming from on top of cliff)  JOANNA!!  You hurry up and eat\n         those eggs and get your tail up here!  MOVE IT!!\n\n    (Joanna moves the \"eggs\" to the edge; knocks them over the cliff with\n    her tail; she yanks on the rope for McLeach to bring he up; as she does,\n    another rock falls that looks like an egg; Bernard comes out of hiding.)\n\nBernard: (to the eggs) O.k. you guys, she fell for it.  Looks like the\n         coast is clear.\n\nWilbur:  (flying in to Marahute's nest)  Girls?  Girls, I'm here! (laughs)\n         Where are you, you little chickees you?  (laugh)\n\nBernard: (puzzled at first)  Wilbur?  (louder) Wilbur!\n\nWilbur:  (screams and falls off the edge) Don't EVER do that to me again!\n         Oh... boy... I lost a lot of feathers on that one.\n\nBernard: Wilbur am I glad to see you!  Give me a hand with these eggs will\n         ya? (rolling the eggs out of hiding.)\n\nWilbur:  Yeah, sure.  Wait a minute.... what the heck are you doing up here\n         anyway??\n\nBernard: The kidnapper took the boy and Jake.... Miss Bianca.\n\nWilbur:  Miss Bianca??  Miss Bianca's in trouble?!?  Woah!  Geez!  That's\n         terrible!  We gotta do something!  (chastising) Bernard, I'm\n         disappointed in you.  Hidin' under a nest while Miss Bianca needs\n         our help.  I gotta talk to you mister...\n\nBernard: Wilbur....\n\nWilbur:  (fumbling) You should start searchin' the desert for her, and\n         (fumbling) I'll scan the coastline!\n\nBernard: Wilbur...\n\nWilbur:  That's what I'll do....  I'll ask the chicks on the beach.\n\nBernard: Wilbur!\n\nWilbur:  Huh?  What?!\n\nBernard: Now listen!  (Bernard points to the eggs) There's some chicks\n         right here that need your help.\n\nWilbur:  Really?  (Bernard sits on an egg, and pats it.)  Oh no.... wait a\n         minute... hold it.... I know what you're thinkin' and you're\n         wrong.  Don't even.... no... (Bernard gives him a stare) don't\n         look at me like that!  You're gettin' no from me!  You understand?\n         No!  I will not.. EVER sit on those eggs!\n\n         (scene changes to Wilbur sitting on the eggs)  Aww... nuts!\n         (sigh)... (to himself) Gotta learn to be more assertive.  No is no\n         is NO.  (to the eggs) Hey, quit movin' in there!\n\n(scene:  McLeach's vehicle)\n\nMcLeach: Well Joanna, it looks like lady luck has finally decided to smile\n         on us.  Everything's going our way.  (laughs to himself).\n\nCody:    (screaming) You can't do this!!  You're gonna get in big trouble!!\n         I'll tell the rangers where you are!!\n\nMcLeach: (groan) I almost forgot...we got a loose end to tie up, haven't we\n         girl?\n\n    (Joanna looks through the back window; makes a face at Cody; Cody makes\n    on back and smacks the glass and scares Joanna)\n\nBianca:  (consoling) Now, now Cody, we mustn't loose hope.  Bernard is\n         still out there...\n\nJake:    (mocking sincerity) That's right!  Is anyone can get us out of\n         this scrape it's old Berno!  (aside) Nice bluff, Miss B.\n\nBianca:  I wasn't bluffing.  You don't know Bernard like I do.  He'll never\n         give up.  (looking back out over the trail)\n\n(scene:  Bernard on the trail of McLeach's truck.)\n\n    (Bernard is seen running along the trail of McLeach's truck; after\n    turning a \"corner\" he realizes just how far he has to go; he sighs in\n    disbelief).\n\nBernard: Oh my gosh!\n\n    (He hears a sound; there is a razorback right next to him sleeping;\n    Bernard looks scared at first; thinks; gets an idea; builds up courage;\n    and goes for it.)\n\n         Ahem... ahem.... ah... excuse me... (the razorback wakes up and\n         grunts at him) (assertively) now look, I've got a long way to go,\n         (Bernard roughs up the razorback by the snout) you're going to\n         take me there, and you're not going to give me any trouble about\n         it, right?  (the razorback whimpers and shakes his head no.)\n         Good.  (Bernard climbs up the razorback) Now git. (they take off\n         down the trail).\n\n(scene: Crocodile falls)\n\nMcLeach: (Cody has been tied up to a hoist and hook) Are ya ready boy?\n         It's time you learned how to fish for crocs! (laughs) They like it\n         when you use live bait... and you're as live as they come.\n         (laughs and sings as he adjusts a light onto Cody so that the\n         crocodiles can see him)  Oh... you get a line, and I'll get a\n         pole, matey.... you get a line, I'll get a pole, friend.... oh,\n         you get a line, I'll get a pole, we'll go fishin' at the crocodile\n         hole, buddy, pal o' mine.... (to the crocs)  That's right babies,\n         suppertime!  (continues to sing as Cody is lowered to the water.)\n\nJake:    It don't look good Miss B.  I can't see any way out of this one.\n\nBianca:  (to the air) Oh Bernard, please hurry!\n\nMcLeach: (laughing/singing) Now, this is MY idea of FUN.  (begins to play\n         with the hoist controls; dunks Cody in the water and pulls him\n         out.)  Nothing personal boy, but I wouldn't want to disappoint the\n         rangers.  They was looking so hard for ya, and now... they're\n         gonna find ya!  (drops Cody once more, but before Cody hits the\n         water, the power goes out.)\n\n         What the blazes going on here?  (McLeach looks down over truck;\n         sees a razorback running out of the truck cab).\n\n         Joanna?  (McLeach climbs down) Did you know, there was a razorback\n         in my truck?  (she shakes her head yes at first) Did ya?  Did ya??\n         (she shakes he head no) (yelling)  There was a RAZORBACK in my\n         truck.  Now you quit playing around and do your job, you four-\n         legged python!!  (She climbs down to look around)\n\n         (McLeach looks inside the truck cab.)  Hey, what happened to them\n         keys?  (fishing around the floor; Bernard is hiding underneath the\n         gas pedal with the keys.)  Must be around here somewhere, they\n         couldn't just get up and walk away.  Something weird's going on\n         around here.... I smell a big, fat rat.\n\n\n    (Cody is still hanging just above the water; the crocodiles jump for\n    him; Bernard jumps out of the truck cab with the keys; he tiptoes\n    underneath the truck; Joanna follows him and then chases him.)\n\nBianca:  Look, it's Bernard!\n\nJake:    I don't believe it!  Way to go mate!\n\nBernard: Miss Bianca, Jake, catch!!  (He throws the keys up to them)\n\n         (Joanna chases after him) Woah!\n\nMcLeach: Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat. (getting out his\n         gun) (laughs)\n\n    (Jake and Bianca work the keys up the cage)\n\n    (Joanna continues to chase Bernard; Bernard tricks Joanna into biting\n    her tail; he hides in a log; Bianca and Jake continue to work the keys\n    up the cage; a gunshot is heard; Marahute screeches.)\n\nMcLeach: Blasted!!\n\nBernard: Oh my gosh!  I hope I know what I'm doing!\n\n    (another shot goes off;  this time, it hits the rope and severs it most\n    of the way; Bernard kicks Joanna; runs for McLeach.)\n\n         Thhpppt.\n\n    (Bernard runs up McLeach just as he takes aim again; Joanna follows and\n    tackles McLeach.)\n\nMcLeach: Hey, get off me!!  Joanna!  What are ya.....\n\n    (Bernard pushes McLeach over with one finger) (screams and falls into\n    the water)\n\n         Joanna!  Joanna!!  You stupid rodent!  Get off me!  You idiot!\n         Get off of me!  No!  No!  (begins to beat away crocodiles with his\n         gun.)\n\n    (the rope breaks and Cody falls into the water)\n\nBianca:  Bernard the boy!!\n\n    (Bernard dives into the water to get Cody; they both surface.)\n\nCody:    Help!!  Help!!\n\n    (Bernard swims for shore; he ties Cody's rope around a tree limb.)\n\nMcLeach: (hitting the crocodiles) Get back, get back, go on, get away from\n         me, get away from me.... (the crocs retreat) (laughs) HA!  I\n         whooped ya!  I whooped ya all!  You'll think twice before messin'\n         with Percival C. McLeach!! (laughs)  Woah!  (realizes that he is\n         headed for the waterfall and tries to swim back; Joanna waves\n         goodbye) NOO!!!! (McLeach goes over the edge of the waterfall.)\n\nBernard: Don't give up Cody!!\n\n    (the tree limb breaks; Bernard and Cody continue down the river; Jake\n    opens the lock on their cage; Marahute takes off with Jake and Bianca.)\n\nJake:    Hop on Miss B.!!\n\n    (they fly towards Cody)\n\nCody:    Help!  Help! (Cody goes over the waterfall with Bernard)\n\n    (everyone disappears into the mist of the waterfall; a few seconds\n    later, we see all four on Marahute flying away triumphantly into the sky\n    and clouds.)\n\nCody:    (mocks eagle screech)  (looking around; sees Bernard clinging to\n         the rope.)  It's o.k.  Come on.... (to Bernard) Thanks little\n         mate.\n\nBianca:  (hugging Bernard) Oh Bernard you are magnificent, you are\n         absolutely the hero of the day.\n\nBernard: (rushed) Miss Bianca, before anything else happens... (sighs; gets\n         out the ring and gets on one knee).... will you marry me?\n\nBianca:  (shocked) Bernard!  Of COURSE, I will!  (hugs Bernard.)\n\nJake:    Well done mate. (Jake gives Bernard the thumbs up sign.)\n\nCody:    Come on Marahute, let's all go home.\n\n    (Marhute flies higher and the four of them cruise off into the clouds\n    and the moon.)\n\n(scene: high on the cliff at Marahute's nest)\n\nWilbur:  Help!!!  Anybody!!  Bernard!!  Bianca!!  Where are you?!?  (to\n         himself)  O.k., that's it, I'm outta here, this is ridiculous.\n         You can't leave me here alone (laughs).  I'm gone!  I am GONE!\n         (the sound of eggs breaking open and chirping is heard) (to the\n         eggs) Aww no... stay in those eggs!  That's a direct order!  (in a\n         baby-ish voice) Awww..... hey... you're kind of a cute little\n         feller, coochy coochy.... YOW! WOAH!!!

Birds follow him; and squak at him.)\n\nCody:    (to the birds) I know, I'm coming.\n\n    (Cody jumps over a hollow log)\n          Hustle up Nelson, Faloo's sounding the call!\n\n    (Cody slides through a log, picks up a stick, and beats on the roof of\n    the wombats home.)\n          C'mon little wombats, hurry!\n\n    (Cody continues to run through the forest with all of the animals\n    following him.)\n\n    (Cody arrives at the tree where Faloo has been sounding the call.)\n\n         (to Faloo) Who's caught this time?\n\nFaloo:   You don't know her, Cody, her name is Marahute, the great golden\n         eagle.\n\nCody:    Where is she?\n\nFaloo:   She's caught, high on a cliff in a poacher's trap.

(Marahute drops her head) Oh... my dad's\n         gone too.\n\n    (Cody give Marahute an affectionate stroke;  as they fix the covering on\n    the eggs, the wind picks up and blows a feather in Cody's face; he looks\n    at it, plays with it,",

Marahute picks it up and gives\n    it to Cody and he gives her a hug.)\n\n    (Marahute and Cody are now on the ground; Marahute takes off and Cody\n    runs around making flying noises)\n\n(scene:  just inside the forest.  A wanted poster of McLeach is posted on a\n         tree; A mouse is tied up with a bell attached to it that rings as\n         it struggles; Cody hears the bell and goes over to the mouse.)\n\nCody:    Heh heh... hey little fella, what happened to you?\n\nBaitmouse:    (panicking) Oh no!

Come back!\n\n    (Cody tries to climb out; he gets halfway up, grabs a tree root; it\n    breaks and he falls; the baitmouse begins to lower a vine down to help\n    Cody)\n\nBaitmouse:    Here you go, grab on.\n\nCody:    That's great, just a little more, a little further... there!  I\n         got it.\n\n    (a rumble is heard and the ground begins to shake.)\n\nBaitmouse:    Uh-oh.\n\n    (view of McLeach's vehicle trampling through the forest disturbing\n    everything)\n\nBaitmouse:    Yipe!\n\n    (The vine is severed as McLeach's truck comes to a screeching halt; Cody\n    falls; the truck opens; Joanna leans over pit and growls; Cody yells)\n\nMcLeach: (unseen, approaching the trap) Well Joanna, what'd we get today?\n         A dingo, a fat ol'",

(mumbling to\n         himself) Dumb lizard always tryin' to bury squirrels out here.\n\nCody:    Unh-unh.  It's a trap, and poachin's against the law.\n\nMcLeach: Trap?!  Where'd you get an idea like that??  Boy I think you've\n         been down in that hole for too long.  (he holds his gun out so\n         that Cody can grab it) Well c'mon, grab ahold.  We'll get you out\n         of this little ol' lizard hole and you can just run along home.\n\n    (Joanna has spotted the baitmouse on Cody's backpack.  She hisses and\n    makes a face.)\n\nCody:    This IS a poacher's trap and YOU'RE a poacher.\n\n    (The mouse ducks back into the backpack; Joanna jumps on Cody, knocking\n    McLeach into the hole; his gun goes off; Joanna begins to attach Cody's\n",

(climbing out of the hole) I'm gonna kill\n         that dumb, slimey, egg-sucking salamander.\n\nCody:    Cut it out!  Get off of me!\n\n    (Joanna continues to attack the backpack; McLeach picks up his gun; he\n    points it at Joanna; looking through gun scope McLeach aims at Joanna,\n    she tries to get out of his view; as she does this, McLeach spots the\n    feather in Cody's pack; he picks up Cody by his backpack.)\n\nMcLeach: Hmmm.... good girl Joanna.  (Joanna looks up and grins happily.)\n\n         (to Cody) Say where'd you get this pretty feather boy?\n\nCody:    (humbly) It was a present.\n\nMcLeach: (coddling) Oh, that's real nice.  Who gave it to ya?\n\nCody:    (stumbling) It's a s... secret.\n\nMcLeach: That's no secret boy, you see, (menacing) I already got the\n         father.",

He lived in that happy place with God.  Then God made the\nworld.  He told the hills to come up out of the earth, and the seas to\nrun down into the deep places which He had made for them.  He made the\ngrass, the trees, and all the pretty flowers.  He put the sun, the\nmoon, and the stars in the sky.  He filled the water with swimming\nfish, the air with flying birds, and the dry land with walking and\ncreeping animals.  And then He said, 'Let _Us_ make man.'  Who were\nmeant by 'Us'?  Who was with God when He made the world?  It was Jesus.\nThe Bible says:\n\n'THE WORD (that means Jesus) WAS WITH GOD, AND THE WORD WAS GOD.  THE\nSAME WAS IN THE BEGINNING WITH GOD.  ALL THINGS WERE MADE BY HIM.'\n\nSo after He had made everything else, God made a man, and named him\nAdam.  God put Adam into the beautiful Garden of Eden, and at first he\nwas good and very happy.  God also made a woman, named Eve, to be his\nwife, and to help him to take care of the garden.  All the fruit in the\ngarden, except what grew on one tree, was given to Adam and Eve to eat;\nall the animals were their servants; and God was their Friend.\n\nA wicked angel, who had been turned out of heaven, saw how happy Adam\nand Eve were, and he was angry, and thought, 'I will make them as bad\nand unhappy as I am; I will make them do what God has told them not to\ndo.  Then he will turn them out of Eden, and they and their children\nwill be my servants for ever, and I shall be king of the world.'\n\nSo the wicked angel, whose name was Satan, came into Eden.  He got Adam\nand Eve to take the fruit which God had told them not to eat, and God\nhad to send them out of the beautiful garden; for God had said He would\npunish Adam and Eve if they took that fruit, and God always keeps His\nword.\n\nBut God went on loving Adam and Eve even when He knew that He must\npunish them, and He tried to make them good in this way.  He thought,\n'I will send My dear Son down to the earth.  He shall become a little\nchild, and grow up to be a man, and shall die for the sins of the\nworld.'\n\nHundreds and hundreds of years passed away before Jesus came.  But a\ngreat many of the people who lived in Palestine were expecting Him.\nGod had said that when Jesus came, He would be a Jew.  The Jews were\nvery proud about that.  They often talked about the coming of Jesus.\nWhen they talked about Him, they called Him the Messiah.\n\nJust before Jesus was born, the Jews were very unhappy.  Roman soldiers\nhad been fighting with them, and had conquered them, and made them\nservants of the great Roman king.  He was called Augustus Caesar, and\nhe gave the Jews another king called Herod.  He was very wicked.\n\n[Illustration: Map of Palestine at the time of Christ.]\n\nThe Jews longed to get rid of Herod, and many of them thought, 'It will\nbe all right when the Messiah comes.  The Messiah will fight against\nthe Romans; He will drive them away from our land; and then He will be\nour King instead of that wicked Herod.'  But only a few Jews remembered\nthat Jesus was coming to fight against Satan and against sin.\n\nThe place where the Jews lived had four or five names.  It was called\nthe Land of Canaan at the first, then the Land of Promise, and then the\nLand of Israel.  But we call it the Holy Land, or Palestine.\n\nIf you look at the map of Palestine, you will see a river running from\nthe north of Palestine to the south.  That river is called the Jordan.\nAnd Palestine is divided into four parts,--one at the top (we call that\nthe north), one at the bottom (we call that the south), one in the\nmiddle, and one on the other or eastward side of the Jordan.\n\nThe part in the North is called Galilee.  The part in the south is\ncalled Judaea.  The part in the middle is called Samaria.  The part on\nthe other side of the Jordan is called Perea.\n\nPalestine is full of hills, with great holes, called caves, in their\nsides.  Palestine is not very big; England is about six times, and New\nYork State about five times larger.  Washington is called the capital\nof the United States.  The capital of Palestine was Jerusalem.\n\nJerusalem was a very beautiful city.  It was built on four or five\nhills which were very close together.  One of these hills was called\nMount Moriah.  On the top of Mount Moriah there was a great Temple\nwhere the Jews went to pray.  Part of the Temple was called the Holy\nPlace, the part at the very top of the mountain.  It was splendid with\nits shining gold and white marble, but it was not very large, for the\npeople were not allowed to go into it.  When it was time for the Jews\nto go to the Temple, silver trumpets were blown once, twice, three\ntimes, and then the gates were thrown open, and the people crowded into\nthe courts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nJESUS IS BORN IN BETHLEHEM\n\nMary, the mother of Jesus, lived in the little town of Nazareth, among\nthe hills of Galilee.  She was going to be married to a carpenter\ncalled Joseph, who, like herself, lived in Nazareth.  One day God sent\nthe angel Gabriel to Mary with a message.  Mary, when she saw and heard\nthe angel, was a little frightened.  But the angel told her he had some\nglad news for her.  Jesus, the Son of God, the Messiah, was coming into\nthe world very soon, and He was to come in the form of a baby, as\nMary's little child.  And Gabriel said that when He was born, Mary must\ncall Him JESUS.\n\nMary had a cousin named Elizabeth, who lived more than a hundred miles\naway from Nazareth, and Mary longed to talk with her about all these\nwonderful things.  So she got ready for a long journey, and went off\ninto the hill country of Judaea to see Elizabeth.\n\nAnd God had also promised to send Elizabeth a son.  And soon after\nMary's visit the baby was born, and all Elizabeth's friends were glad,\nand came to see her, and to thank God with her for His great kindness.\n\nThe little Jew babies have a name given to them when they are eight\ndays old.  And Elizabeth's son was named John.\n\nOne night, soon after Mary got back from her cousin Elizabeth's house,\nthe angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph in a dream.  The angel told\nJoseph to marry Mary, and he told him Mary's secret about the Son of\nGod coming to earth as her little child, and he said to Joseph, 'THOU\nSHALT CALL HIS NAME JESUS, FOB HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR\nSINS.'  When Joseph woke up, his first thought was to do what the angel\nhad told him, and he at once took Mary to his own home as his wife.\n\nAbout this time Caesar Augustus, the great Emperor at Rome, sent word\nto Herod that he was to take a census of the Jews.  Everybody's name\nhad to be written down and his age, and many other things about him.\nEvery twenty years Augustus had a census taken, so that he might know\nhow much money the Jews ought to pay him, and how many Jew soldiers he\nought to have.\n\nIn Palestine, at census time, people had to go to the towns where their\nfathers' fathers lived a long time ago, and had to have their names put\ndown there instead of having them put down in their own homes.  Now,\nboth Joseph and Mary belonged to the family of the great king David,\nwho was born in Bethlehem.  So Mary had to prepare for a long journey,\nand go with her husband to Bethlehem.  Bethlehem is six miles from\nJerusalem.  It is on the top of a hill, and people have to climb up a\nsteep road to get into the town.\n\nAn inn is a large house that people stay at when they are on a journey.\nThe inns in Palestine have four walls, with a door in front, and with a\ngreat empty space for camels and horses inside.  In the middle of the\nempty space is a fountain; and all round the walls, a little bit higher\nthan the part where the animals are, there are a number of places like\nempty stone arbors.  These empty places are called _leewans_, and they\nare open in front, so that everybody can see into them.  Yet Mary and\nJoseph, after all their long journey from Nazareth, could not find even\nan empty _leewan_ to lie down in.\n\n[Illustration: The shepherd's care.]\n\nNear that inn there was a place in which asses and camels were kept.\nIt was perhaps a cave in the side of the hill.  And because there was\nno room for them in the inn, Mary and Joseph had to go into that stable\nto sleep, and in that stable Jesus Christ was born.  Mary wrapped Him\nin swaddling clothes, and laid Him in the manger in the place where the\nanimals' food was kept.\n\nOn the hill where Bethlehem stands there are green places where\nshepherds feed their flocks.  There are wild animals in Palestine; and\nall night long the shepherds of Bethlehem watched to see that no harm\nhappened to their sheep.  One night an angel of the Lord stood by them\nand a bright light shown round about them.  The shepherds were afraid;\nbut the angel said, 'FEAR NOT; FOR BEHOLD, I BRING YOU GOOD TIDINGS (OR\nNEWS) OF GREAT JOY, WHICH SHALL BE TO ALL PEOPLE.  FOR UNTO YOU IS BORN\nTHIS DAY IN THE CITY OF DAVID A SAVIOUR, WHICH is CHRIST THE LORD.'\nAnd suddenly there was seen with the angel a number of the angels of\nheaven.  And they praised God, and said, 'GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST,\nAND ON EARTH PEACE, GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN.'\n\nWhen the light faded, and the song ended, and the angels had gone back\ninto heaven, the shepherds climbed quickly over the hillside to\nBethlehem.  And there, in the stable near the inn, they found Mary and\nJoseph, and the Babe lying in the manger, as the angels had said.\n\nJesus was the eldest son of His mother.  And the eldest sons in Jewish\nhouses, when they were forty days old, were taken to the Temple, and\ngiven to God.\n\nSo now, when Jesus was nearly six weeks old, He was brought from\nBethlehem by Mary and Joseph to the Temple at Jerusalem.  The mothers\nused to take a lamb with them, or two pigeons, as a sacrifice to God.\nMary took two pigeons.  She was not rich enough to buy a lamb.\n\nA long way on the eastern side of the Jordan, there were countries\nwhere the people used to watch the sun and the moon and the stars very\ncarefully.  If they saw anything new and strange in the heavens, they\nthought it meant that something wonderful was going to happen.  But\nsome of them knew and had heard from the Jews about God, and about the\nMessiah who was coming; and they, like the Jews, were longing for Jesus.\n\nOne day these wise men saw a bright star which they had never seen\nbefore.  And as they looked at it they felt sure that a great King of\nthe Jews had been born in Judaea.  So they took camels and rich\npresents of gold and sweet-smelling stuff--such as people gave to kings\nin those days--and they loaded their camels, and left their homes, and\nrode for many weeks till they came to Jerusalem.  And when they got\nthere they said, 'Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we\nhave seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him.'\n\n[Illustration: Bethlehem.]\n\nWhen Herod heard about these wise men he was troubled.  He sent for the\nbest priests, and other clever men, and asked them where Christ would\nbe born.  And they said to him, 'In Bethlehem of Judaea.'  They had\nread that in the Bible.  Then Herod said to the wise men, 'Go and\nsearch out carefully about the young Child; and when ye have found Him,\nbring me word, that I also may come and worship Him.'\n\nWhen the wise men had heard the king, they went away to Bethlehem, and\nlo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the\nyoung Child was.  And they rejoiced with great joy.  And when they were\ncome into the house (there was room in the inn now) they saw the young\nChild with Mary, His mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him, and\nthey gave Him their presents--gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.  But\nthe wise men did not go back to Herod.  God told them in a dream not to\ngo.  So they went home by another way instead.\n\nAfter the wise men were gone, the angel of the Lord came to Joseph in\nhis sleep, and said to him, 'Arise, and take the young Child and His\nmother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word:\nfor Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.'  That meant to\nkill Him.  So Joseph at once got up, and took the young Child and His\nmother by night, and went away to Egypt.\n\nWhen Herod found that the wise men did not come back, he was very\nangry, and he sent his soldiers to Bethlehem, and had all the baby boys\nkilled--all the children who were less than two years of age.  And they\nkilled all the baby boys in the places near Bethlehem as well.  And the\npoor mothers cried, and nobody could comfort them.\n\nJoseph and Mary stayed in Egypt, waiting for the angel to bring them\nword that it was time to go back again to Palestine.  And one night,\nwhen Jesus was about three years old, the message came.  The angel of\nthe Lord said to Joseph in a dream, 'Arise, and take the young Child\nand His mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which\nsought the young Child's life.'  Joseph got up, and took the young\nChild and His mother, and went into the land of Israel.  But when he\ncame there, people said to him, 'Herod is dead, but his son Archelaus\nis king.'  And when Joseph knew that Archelaus was king, he was afraid\nto stay in Judaea.  And God spoke to him again in a dream, and told him\nto go back to Galilee.  So Joseph and Mary went back to Galilee, and\nlived in Nazareth again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE BOYHOOD OF JESUS\n\nThe Bible tells us only a few stories about the time when Jesus was a\nlittle boy.\n\nNazareth is built up the side of a hill, and there are plenty of\ngardens and fields down below.  Amongst these fields there is a\nfountain, where the women of Nazareth go to fetch water.  Jesus must\noften have gone with His mother to that fountain; and sometimes, when\nshe was tired, He may have fetched the water for her Himself.\n\n[Illustration: Nazareth, from hill above.]\n\nMary wore a long blue dress, tied round the waist, and a cap with\npieces of money sewn round it, and a white cloth over her head and\nshoulders, just as the women of Nazareth do now; and Jesus was very\nlikely dressed in a red cap, a bright tunic, a sash of many colours,\nand a little jacket of white or blue, just as the boys of Nazareth are\ndressed now.\n\nThe houses of Nazareth are white.  Grape vines grow over their walls,\nand doves sit and coo on the flat roofs.  There is not much inside the\nhouses: sometimes they have only one room.  There is a lamp in the\nmiddle of the room, and round the walls there are waterpots.  There are\nbright-coloured quilts on a shelf.  People unroll these quilts at night\nand lie down upon them.  There are mats and carpets in the house, and a\nbright-coloured box with treasures in it, and a painted wooden stool;\nand that is nearly all.\n\n[Illustration: Jewish women grinding corn.]\n\nWhen the people of the house want to eat, they put a tray of food on\nthe wooden stool, and they sit round the tray on the floor, and eat\nwith their hands.  People in Palestine would not know what to do with\ntables and chairs, and knives and forks, like ours.\n\nThe streets of Nazareth are long and narrow, and they are full of\nchickens and dogs, of donkeys and camels, of blind beggars and\nchildren.  There are little shops by the side of the streets, something\nlike the _leewans_ in the inn which I told you about.  But the tailors,\nthe shoemakers, the carpenters, and the coffee-grinders do not always\nsit in their shops.  They like to sit on the ground outside, and do\ntheir work in the street; and the sellers of dates and of figs, beans,\nbarley, oranges, and other things, sit down in the street to sell their\ngoods.\n\nJoseph, Mary's husband, was a carpenter, and Jesus became a carpenter,\nand often came out of the little shop and sat on the ground with plane,\nhammer, glue, and saw, and worked away in the narrow street, just as\nthe carpenters of Nazareth do now.\n\nWhen the Jewish boys were twelve years old, they were called 'Sons of\nthe Law,' and they were taken to Jerusalem for the Passover.  When\nJesus was twelve years old, Joseph and His mother took Him up with them\nto the Passover.  When the week was over, Mary and Joseph started for\nthe journey back to Nazareth.  But Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem.\nThousands of people must have been leaving Jerusalem just at the very\ntime that Mary and Joseph went away.  So when Mary and Joseph did not\nsee Jesus in the crush, they did not at first feel frightened.  They\nthought, 'We shall find Him soon with some of our friends.'  All day\nlong they kept on looking for Him in the crowd, but they did not see\nHim.  And at last they went back again to Jerusalem looking for Him.\n\nNext day they found Him in one of the courts of the Temple.  Several\nRabbis were there, and everyone who saw and heard Him was astonished.\nThey asked Him questions too, and He answered them wisely and well.\nNobody could understand how a young boy could be so wise.\n\nWhen Mary and Joseph saw Jesus sitting here, with Rabbis coming all\naround Him, they were greatly surprised.  But His mother asked Him why\nHe had stayed behind, and said, 'Thy father and I have sought Thee\nsorrowing.'  Jesus said to His mother, 'HOW IS IT THAT YE HAVE SOUGHT\nME?  WIST YE NOT (DID YOU NOT KNOW) THAT I MUST BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S\nBUSINESS?'\n\nAnd now He went back with her and with Joseph to Nazareth, and obeyed\nthem, exactly as He always had done.  We do not know much more about\nJesus when He was a boy.  But we do know that as He grew taller, He\n'increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJOHN THE BAPTIST\n\nYou remember about the child that was called John.  Zacharias, his\nfather, and Elisabeth gave John to God directly he was born.  They\nnever cut his hair, and they never let him drink wine, or eat grapes,\nor eat raisins.  That was the way they did in those days to show that\nhe belonged to God.\n\nWhen John was old enough to understand, he gave himself to God.  And as\nhe grew older, he made up his mind that he would leave his home and\nfriends, and go and live in the wilderness; and his food there was\nlocusts and wild honey.  Locusts are like large grasshoppers, and poor\npeople in the East often eat them.  They taste like shrimps, but are\nnot so nice.\n\nGod had said that John should go before the Messiah to prepare the way\nfor Him--to get people's hearts ready for the Saviour.  And when John\nwas in the wilderness, God told him to begin his work.  So John went\ndown from the wild hills of Judaea to the River Jordan, and he began to\npreach to everyone who passed by.  There were many people passing by,\nfor he went to the place where people crossed the Jordan.\n\n[Illustration: The River Jordan.]\n\nJohn said, REPENT!' (that means, 'Be really sorry for your sins'), 'FOR\nTHE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is AT HAND.'  A very great many people went from\nJerusalem, and out of all the land of Judaea, on purpose to hear John\npreaching.  And when they had heard him, some of them said to him,\n'What shall we do then?'  And John told them that they were to be kind\nto one another; that they were to give food to the hungry and clothing\nto the naked.\n\nSome even of the proud Rabbis came down to the Jordan to John, and John\ntold these Rabbis that they must not be proud because they were Jews,\nbut must try to be good really and truly.\n\nA great many of the people who heard John preach felt sorry for the\nthings they had done, and they told John how sorry they were, and John\nbaptized them in the River Jordan.  John told the people that he could\nonly baptize their bodies with water, but that some one else was coming\nwho would be able to baptize their hearts with the Holy Spirit.  This\nwas Jesus.\n\n[Illustration: Jericho, from plains above.]\n\nAfter John had baptized a great many persons, he saw coming to him, one\nday, for baptism, a Man about thirty years old; and when John looked at\nHim, he saw that He was quite different from all the people who had\nbeen to him before.  It was Jesus who had come to be baptized before He\nbegan His work.  He wanted to obey God in everything; and He wanted to\nshow that He was the Brother and Friend of all the people whom John had\nbeen baptizing.  And so, as Jesus wished it, John went into the River\nJordan with Him and baptized Him.\n\nWhen Jesus had been baptized, and was full of the Holy Spirit, He went\naway into a wilderness.  And there, when Jesus was tired and hungry,\nSatan came to Him--just as he came to Adam and Eve in the Garden of\nEden--to tempt Him.\n\nTo tempt means to try.  Mother tries you sometimes, to see whether you\ncan be trusted; and God tries us all sometimes.  But if God tries us,\nit is to make us better; and if Satan tries us, it is to make us worse.\n\nEvery time that Jesus was tempted, He said, 'It is written,' and then\nHe told Satan something 'which was written in the Bible.  That is the\nvery best way to fight Satan.  The Bible is called 'the Sword of the\nSpirit,' and Satan is afraid when he sees us using that Sword.  Let us\nask God to fill us, like Jesus, with the Holy Spirit, and then we shall\nsoon learn how to use the Sword of the Spirit, and we too shall be able\nto drive Satan away when he comes to tempt us.\n\nOnly we must be sure to read the Bible, as Jesus used to do, or else we\nshall never be able to drive Satan away by telling him the things that\nGod has written there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nJESUS BEGINS HIS WORK\n\nOne day, when the fight of Jesus with the devil in the wilderness was\nover, He came to Bethabara, where John was baptizing, and when John saw\nJesus coming towards him, he said:\n\n'BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD, WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.'\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus again, and again he said the same words:\n\n'BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD!'\n\nJohn called Jesus the Lamb of God, because He had come to die for our\nsins.\n\nTwo men were standing close to John when Jesus came by, and they heard\nwhat he said.  The name of one of these men was Andrew, and of the\nother John.  Jesus knew that they would like to speak to Him, so He\nturned round and asked them what they wanted.  'Master,' they said,\n'where dwellest Thou?' (that means 'where are you living?')  Jesus\nsaid, 'Come, and you shall see.'  And He took the two disciples to His\nhome, and He let them stay with Him the whole of the day.  What a happy\nday that must have been!\n\nAndrew had a brother called Simon, and he went and found him, and told\nhim that he had found the Messiah, and brought him to see his new\nMaster.  So now Jesus had three disciples--John, Andrew, and Simon; and\nnext day He took them away with Him to Galilee.  While they were going\nalong, Jesus saw a man called Philip, who came from the place where\nSimon and Andrew lived when they were at home.  Jesus told Philip to\ncome with Him, and he came.  But Philip went to a friend of his, a very\ngood man called Nathanael, also called Bartholomew, and he told him\nthat he had found Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, and begged him to\ncome and see Him.\n\nHow many disciples had Jesus now?  Let us see.  John, Andrew, Simon,\nPhilip, and Nathanael--five.  And very likely John had brought his\nbrother James to Jesus.  If so, that would make six.\n\nDirectly Jesus came into Galilee He was invited to a wedding, at a\nplace called Cana, and all of His disciples with Him.  Jesus went to\nthe wedding because He likes to see people happy, and loves to make\nthem happy.  In America, people often drink more wine at weddings and\nat other times than is good for them, and a great many people go\nwithout any wine at all, so as to set a good example.  But in the East\nit is different.  The people there hardly ever take too much wine.  So\nJesus allowed His disciples to use it, and He drank it Himself.  There\nwas some wine at the wedding party to which Jesus went; but presently\nit came to an end.  Then Mary came to Jesus, and said, 'They have no\nwine.'  Jesus knew what Mary was thinking about, but He had to tell her\nto wait; and He had to make Mary understand that He could not do\neverything now which she told Him to do, exactly as when He was a boy.\nHe was God's Son as well as Mary's, and He had God's work to do, and He\nmust do it at God's time.\n\n[Illustration: A modern Jew's wedding party in Galilee.]\n\nBut when Mary went back, she told the servants to do whatever Jesus\ntold them.  Close to the house there were six great stone jars or\nwaterpots, and Jesus said to the servants, 'Fill the waterpots with\nwater.  And they filled them up to the brim.  And lo! when the water\nwas taken out of the jars, it was water no longer, but wine.\n\nThis was the very first miracle that Jesus did, and He did it to make\npeople happy, and to make them believe that He was the Son of God.\nDear children, Jesus wants you to be happy.  And the best way to be\nhappy is to ask Jesus to go with you everywhere and always, just as\nthose wedding people asked Him to come to their party.\n\nHe did not stay very many days in Capernaum.  The lovely spring flowers\ntold Him that the Passover time was coming, so He went up with His\ndisciples, to Jerusalem.  When Jesus had come to Jerusalem, you may be\nsure that His disciples and He soon went to the Temple, and when they\ngot inside the great Court of the Gentiles they found a market was\ngoing on there.  Men were selling oxen and sheep and doves for\nsacrifice.  Others were sitting at little tables changing money.  And\nthere must have been plenty of noise, for people in the East shout and\nquarrel a great deal when they are buying or selling.\n\nWhen Jesus saw this, He was angry; and He made a whip with pieces of\ncord, and He drove away all the people who were selling in the Temple.\nAnd He turned out the sheep and the oxen; and he told the men who sold\ndoves to take them away, and not turn His Father's House into a store.\nJesus upset the tables of the money-changers too, and poured out their\nmoney.\n\nJesus did a great many wonderful things when He was in Jerusalem that\nPassover time, and many persons saw His miracles, and thought, 'Yes,\nthis is the Messiah.'  But Jesus did not trust any of those people.  He\nknew that they did not really love Him.  But there was one man in\nJerusalem who did want to be Jesus Christ's disciple.  His name was\nNicodemus.  He was a great Rabbi, but not proud like the other Rabbis,\nand he wanted to ask Jesus a great many questions.  But he did not want\nthe other Rabbis and the priests to see him coming to Jesus.  So he\ncame to Jesus by night--in the dark.\n\nDid Jesus say, 'You are not brave, Nicodemus, I am ashamed of you; go\naway'?  Ah no!  He talked kindly to him, and He told him that he would\nhave to be born again.  He meant that Nicodemus must ask God to send\nhim His Holy Spirit, and to give him a new heart.  And then Jesus\nexplained to Nicodemus why He had come down from heaven.  He said:\n\n'GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT\nWHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING\nLIFE.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSOME WORDS AND WORKS OF JESUS\n\nJesus having to go to Galilee, made up His mind to pass through\nSamaria.  It was a long, rough journey, and at last they came near a\ntown called Sychar.  Near by was the well dug by Jacob when he lived in\nShechem.  Jesus was so tired that He sat down to rest on the edge of\nthe well, while His disciples went on to buy food.\n\n[Illustration: Jacob's well.]\n\nWhile Jesus was sitting by the well, a woman came there to draw water.\nJesus asked her to do something kind for Him, He said 'Give Me to\ndrink.'  The woman was surprised, and said to Him, 'You are a Jew, and\nI am a Samaritan.  Why then do you ask me for water?'\n\nJesus said, 'IF YOU KNEW WHO I AM, YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME, AND I WOULD\nHAVE GIVEN YOU LIVING WATER.'  Jesus meant the Holy Spirit.  He gives\nthe Holy Spirit to everyone who asks Him.\n\nThen Jesus spoke to the woman about the bad things she had done, and\nshe tried to make Him talk about something else.  But she could not\nstop His wonderful words.  At last she said, 'I know that the Messiah\nis coming.  He will tell us all things.'  Then Jesus said to her, 'I\nTHAT SPEAK UNTO THEE AM HE.'\n\nJust then His disciples came up to the well, and they were very much\nastonished to see Him talking to the woman.  The Jew men were too proud\nto talk much to women, even if the women were Jews; and this was a\nSamaritan.  But the disciples did not ask Jesus any questions about why\nHe talked to the woman.  They brought Him the things they had been\nbuying, and said, 'Master, eat.'  But Jesus was so happy that He had\nbeen able to speak good words to that poor woman that He did not feel\nhungry any more.  He told His disciples that doing God's work was the\nfood He liked best.\n\nAfter this Jesus lived for awhile first at Nazareth, and then at\nCapernaum.  There was a boy ill in Capernaum just then with a fever.\nIt is so hot near the Sea of Galilee that the people who live there\noften get fever.  That sick boy's father was rich, but money could not\nmake the dying boy well.  His father had heard of Jesus, and when he\nknew that Jesus had come into Galilee, and that He was only a few miles\naway, he came to Him, and begged Him to come down to Capernaum and make\nhis child well.  At first Jesus said to him, 'You will not believe on\nMe unless you see Me do some wonderful thing.'  But when He saw how\neager the poor father was, He thought He would try him, and He said to\nhim, 'Go thy way, thy son liveth.'  Directly Jesus said that, the man\nfelt sure in his heart that his boy was well.  He did not ask Jesus any\nmore to come with him, but he just went back home quietly by himself.\n\nNext day, as he was going down the long hilly road from Cana to\nCapernaum, some of the servants from his house came to meet him, and\nthey said to him, 'Thy son liveth.'  Then the father asked them what\ntime it was when the boy began to get better, and said, 'Yesterday, at\nthe seventh hour (that means at one o'clock) the fever left him.'  Then\nthe father knew that that was the very time when Jesus had said to him,\n'Thy son liveth,' and he and all the people in the house believed in\nJesus.\n\nThe Jews could not bear paying taxes to the Romans, and they hated the\npublicans.  They would not eat with them or talk with them.  But Jesus\ndid not hate the publicans.  He only hated the wrong things they did.\nSo one day, when He was outside the town of Capernaum, and saw Matthew\nsitting and taking the taxes, He said to him, 'Follow Me.'  And Matthew\ngot up from his work, and at once left all and followed Jesus.\n\nJesus often told His disciples beautiful stories.  One day He told them\na story to teach them not to be proud like the Pharisees.  'Two men\nwent up into the Temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a\npublican.  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I\nthank Thee that I am not as other men are; I thank Thee that I am not\neven as this publican.  Twice a week I go without food, and I give away\na great deal of money.  But the publican, standing afar off, would not\nlift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,\nsaying, God be merciful to me, a sinner.  When the publican went home\nthat night he was better and happier than the Pharisee.  The Pharisee\n_thought_ he was good; he did not want to be forgiven, and so God let\nhim carry all his sins back home with him again.  But the publican\n_knew_ he was a sinner, and was sorry, and so God forgave his sins.'\n\nWhile Jesus was in Capernaum, He went every Sabbath day to teach in the\nsynagogue.  One day a man shouted out--\n\n'What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?  I know Thee who\nThou art, the Holy One of God.'\n\nSatan had put an unclean spirit, or devil, in that man.  Jesus was not\nangry with the poor man, but He spoke to the unclean spirit, and said,\n'Be silent, and come out of him.'  He came out, and the man became\nwell.  The people in the synagogue were greatly surprised.  They said,\n'What thing is this?  He commandeth even the unclean spirits and they\nobey Him.'\n\nWhen the service was over, the people who had seen the miracle went\nhome, and talked to everybody about what they had seen.  Some of them\nhad sick friends, and some had friends with unclean spirits, and they\nlonged to bring them to Jesus.  But it was the Sabbath, and they would\nnot bring them until the evening, at which time their Sabbath came to\nan end.  So as soon as the sun set that Sabbath day, a great crowd was\nseen standing round Peter's house.  It seemed as if all the people of\nCapernaum must be there!  They had brought their sick friends, and laid\nthem down at the door.  And Jesus put His hands on the sick people, and\nhealed them all.\n\nIn the east there is a dreadful illness called leprosy, and the people\nwho have it are called lepers.  No doctor can cure it.  At the time\nwhen Jesus lived on the earth, lepers were not allowed to come into\ncities.  And they had to go about with nothing on their heads, and with\ntheir dresses torn, and with their mouths covered over; and when they\nsaw anybody coming, they had to call out, 'Unclean! unclean!'\n\nOne day when Jesus went into a town a leper saw Him.  The poor man came\nto Jesus and knelt down before Him, and fell on his face.  And he said,\n'If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.'  And Jesus put out His hand,\nand touched him, and said to him, 'I will; be thou clean.'  And as soon\nas Jesus had said that, the leper was well.\n\nSin is just like leprosy.  A baby's naughtiness does not look very bad;\nbut that naughtiness spreads and gets stronger as baby gets older, and\nnobody but Jesus can take it away.\n\nJesus Christ's body must often have felt very tired, for crowds\nfollowed Him about all the time.  They came from Perea, and from\nJudaea, and from other places too, to see the wonderful new Teacher.\nAnd Jesus preached to them all, and healed their sicknesses.  The most\nwonderful sermon that was ever preached in all the world is called the\nSermon on the Mount, because Jesus sat down on a hill to preach it.\n\nAfter a time Jesus went up again to Jerusalem.  In or near Jerusalem\nthere was a spring of water which was as good as medicine, because it\nmade sick people well if they bathed in it often enough.  This spring\nran into a bathing-place called the Pool of Bethesda.  Numbers of sick\npersons came to bathe in that pool.  One Sabbath day Jesus saw quite a\ncrowd there.  Some were blind, some were lame, some were sick of the\npalsy.  They were sitting, or lying, by the side of the pool.  Jesus\nwas very sorry for one poor man there.  He had been ill thirty-eight\nyears.  So Jesus said to the man, 'Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.'\nAnd at once the sick man was well, and took up his mattress and walked.\n\nNow the Rabbis had a number of very silly rules about the Sabbath day.\nEven if a man broke his arm or his leg on the Sabbath the Rabbis would\nnot allow the doctor to put the bone right till the next day.  So they\nwere very angry when they found that Jesus had made that poor man well\non the Sabbath day, and had told him to carry his mattress home.  They\ntold the man he was doing very wrong, and they tried to kill Jesus.\nBut Jesus told them that His Heavenly Father was never idle, and that\nHe must do the same works as God.  That made the Rabbis more angry than\never.  They said, 'He calls God His own Father, making Himself equal\nwith God.'  From that time the Jews in Jerusalem made up their minds\nmore than ever to kill Jesus; and wherever He went they sent men to\nwatch Him and listen to His words, so that they might make up some\nexcuse for putting Him to death.\n\nWhat kind of work does God do on Sunday, dear children?  Why, He does\nall sorts of kind and beautiful things.  He makes the sun rise, and the\nflowers grow, and the birds sing; and He takes care of little children\non Sunday exactly the same as he does on other days.  And Jesus did the\nsame kind of work, He made people happy and well on the Sabbath.  And\nwe may do _works of love_--kind, loving things for other people--on\nSunday.\n\nAnother Sabbath day, soon after that, the Lord Jesus and His disciples\nwere walking through a cornfield.  The disciples were hungry, so they\nrubbed some corn in their hands as they went along, and ate it.  Some\nof the Pharisees saw the disciples, and they were shocked; and they\nspoke to Jesus about it.  But Jesus told the Pharisees that the\ndisciples were doing nothing wrong.  He said, 'THE SABBATH WAS MADE FOR\nMAN, AND NOT MAN FOR THE SABBATH; THEREFORE THE SON OF MAN IS LORD ALSO\nOF THE SABBATH DAY.'  Jesus meant that God gave the Sabbath day to Adam\nand his children as a beautiful present, to be the best and happiest\nday of all the seven.  God meant it as a rest for our souls and bodies.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA FRIEND FOR THE SORROWFUL\n\nOne day Jesus went to a town called Nain (or Beautiful), about\ntwenty-five miles from Capernaum.  A great crowd of people followed\nJesus and His disciples; and when they came near to the gate of the\ncity of Nain, they saw a funeral coming out.  The dead body of a young\nman was being carried out on a bier to be buried.\n\nWhen Jesus saw the poor mother crying and sobbing, He felt very sorry\nfor her, and He said to her, 'Weep not.'  And Jesus came and touched\nthe bier, and the men who were carrying it stood still.  And Jesus\nsaid, 'Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.'  And life came back into\nthat dead body again.  He that was dead sat up and began to speak.  And\nJesus gave him back to his mother.\n\nA Pharisee, called Simon, once asked Jesus to come and have dinner with\nhim.  When anyone in that land went to a feast, the master of the house\nused to kiss him, and say, 'The Lord be with you,' and put some sweet\nsmelling oil on his hair and beard, and the servants used to bring the\nvisitor water to wash his feet.  But none of those kind things were\ndone to Jesus when He came to that Pharisee's house.  Presently Jesus\nand Simon began to eat.  In that country, people often _lay_ down to\neat.  Broad settees, or couches, were put round the table, and the\nvisitors used to lie down in rows on these settees.  Their heads were\nnear the table, and their feet were the other way.  They lay down on\ntheir left side, and they had cushions to put their elbows on, so that\nthey could raise themselves up while they were eating.  While Jesus and\nSimon were at dinner, a woman came in out of the street.  In the East,\npeople walk in and out of other people's houses just as they like.  But\nthat woman had been very wicked, and Simon was not pleased when he saw\nher come in.  But nobody said anything to her.  So she came to Jesus,\nand stood at His feet, behind the couch on which He w as lying, and\ncried till the tears ran down her face.  Then as her tears dropped on\nto the feet of Jesus, she stooped down and wiped them away with her\nlong hair.  And then she kissed the feet of Jesus many times, and put\nprecious sweet-smelling ointment upon them.  Perhaps she had heard some\nbeautiful words which Jesus had just been saying to the people out of\ndoors--\n\n'COME UNTO ME, ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN, AND I WILL GIVE\nYOU BEST.'\n\nHer sins were like a heavy load, and so she had come to Jesus.\n\nBut Simon thought to himself, 'If Jesus had really come from God, He\nwould have known how wicked this woman is, and He would not have\nallowed her to touch Him.'\n\nJesus knew what Simon was thinking, and He said that once upon a time\nthere were two men who owed some money.  One owed a great deal of\nmoney, and the other owed a little.  But when the time came for them to\npay the money they could not do it.  And the kind man forgave them both.\n\nJesus then asked Simon which of the two men would love that kind friend\nmost.\n\nSimon said, 'I suppose he to whom he forgave most.'\n\nJesus said that that was quite right.  Then He turned to the woman, and\nsaid to Simon: 'Seest thou this woman?  I came into thine house; thou\ngavest Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with tears,\nand wiped them with the hairs of her head.  Thou gavest Me no kiss, but\nthis woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss My feet:\nMy head with oil thou didst not anoint, but she hath anointed My feet\nwith ointment.  I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are\nforgiven, for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same\nloveth little.'  And then Jesus said to the woman, 'THY SINS ARE\nFORGIVEN.  THY FAITH HATH SAVED THEE.  GO IN PEACE.'  And she left her\nheavy load of sin with Jesus, and took away instead the rest and peace\nHe gives.\n\nAfter Jesus had finished all the work He wanted to do in Nain, He went\nagain into every part of Galilee to tell people the good news that a\nSaviour had come.\n\nJesus preached to the crowds out of a boat.  He told them most\nbeautiful stories.  They liked these stories so much that they did not\ncare to go away--not even when it was evening.  But Jesus and His\ndisciples needed rest, so Jesus told the disciples to go over to the\nother side of the lake.\n\nWhen the boat started, Jesus was so tired that He lay down at the end,\nout of the way of the men who were rowing, and put His head upon a\npillow, and fell fast asleep.  Soon the wind began to blow, and it blew\nlouder and louder.   Then the waves curled over and dashed into the\nboat till the boat was nearly full.  But still Jesus slept quietly on.\nThe disciples were afraid that their boat would sink, and they came to\nJesus, and woke Him, and said, 'Master!  Master! we perish!  Lord,\nsave!'  And Jesus arose, and told the wind to stop, and He said to the\nsea, 'Peace, be still.'  And suddenly the wind stopped, and the sea was\nquite smooth.  Then Jesus said gently to His disciples, 'Where is your\nfaith?'  Those disciples might have known that the boat could not sink\nwhen Jesus was in it.\n\n[Illustration: Ruins of Capernaum.]\n\nWhen Jesus came back to Capernaum, a man, called Jairus, fell down at\nHis feet and begged Him to go to his house, where his little girl,\nabout twelve years old, was dying.  So Jesus and His disciples started\nto go to Jairus' house, and a great crowd of people went with Him.  But\nwhile they were going, someone came to Jairus, and said, 'It is of no\nuse to trouble the Master any more.  The child is dead.'  But Jesus\nsaid to him quickly, 'Do not be afraid.  Only believe, and she shall be\nmade well.'\n\nWhen Jesus came to the house of Jairus, He heard a great noise.  As\nsoon as anyone dies in the East, people come to the house, and cry and\nhowl, and play wretched music.  They are paid to do that.  That was the\nnoise which Jesus heard, and he asked, 'Why do you make this ado?  The\nlittle maid is sleeping.'  And those rude people laughed at Jesus, just\nas if He did not know what He was talking about.  So Jesus turned them\nall out.\n\nThen Jesus took three of His disciples--Peter, and James and John--and\nJairus and his wife; and they went together to look at the child.\nThere she was, lying quite still.  Life had flown away from her body.\nBut Jesus took hold of the girl's hand, and said, 'My little lamb, I\nsay unto thee, Arise.'  And life flew back to her body again, and she\nopened her eyes and got up, and walked.  And Jesus told her father and\nmother to give her something to eat.\n\nWhen Jesus came out of Jairus' house, two blind men followed Him,\nbegging Him to make them well.  Jesus waited till He had got back to\nthe house where He was staying and then He touched their eyes, and made\nthem see.\n\nJust about this time Jesus had some very sad news.  Herod Antipas, the\nson of wicked King Herod, had shut up John the Baptist in a prison,\ncalled the Black Castle, by the side of the Dead Sea.  Part of that\ncastle was a beautiful palace, with lovely furniture and a coloured\nmarble floor.  One day Herod gave a grand birthday party.  Herod had\nmarried a very wicked woman, who was at the party.  Her name was\nHerodias.  Herodias hated John the Baptist, because he had said that\nshe ought not to be Herod's wife.  So she made up her mind to have John\nthe Baptist killed.  Herodias had a daughter called Salome, who danced\nbeautifully.  And on that birthday Herod was so pleased with Salome's\ndancing that he said, 'I will give you anything you ask me for.'\nSalome went to her mother, and said, 'What shall I ask?'  And Herodias\nsaid, 'Ask for the head of John the Baptist.'  And Salome came back\nquickly and said, 'I want the head of John the Baptist.'\n\nNow, it is wrong to break a promise.  But it is not wrong to break a\n_wicked_ promise.  It is wrong ever to have made it.  Herod was sorry,\nbut he was afraid of what other people in the party would think if he\ndid not do what he had said.  So he sent his soldiers to the prison,\nand had John the Baptist's head cut off to give to that dancing-girl.\n\nJesus had sent His twelve disciples out to preach to people He could\nnot go and see Himself.  When they came back they had a great deal to\ntalk about, and they were very tired.  But there were always so many\npeople coming to see Jesus that they could get no quiet time at all, no\ntime even to eat.  They were all at the Lake of Galilee again, and\nJesus told them to come away with Him into a desert place, and rest\nawhile.  That desert place was near a town called Bethsaida, where\nPeter, and his brother Andrew, and Philip lived once upon a time.\n\nJesus and His disciples got into a boat as quietly as they could, and\nwent away.  But some people near the lake caught sight of the boat, and\nthey saw who was in it; and they ran so fast along the shore of the\nlake that they got to the desert before Jesus was there.  Jesus felt\nvery sorry for these people, and He began to teach them many things.\nBy and by it got late, and Jesus said to the disciples, 'How many\nloaves have you?  Go and see.'  And Andrew said, 'There is a boy\nherewith five barley loaves and two fishes; but what are they among so\nmany?'  And Jesus told him to bring the loaves and fishes.  Then Jesus\nsaid, 'Make the people sit down.'  So the disciples arranged the crowds\nin rows on the grass.  And when every one was ready, Jesus took the\nfive loaves and the two fishes in His hands, and He blessed them, and\ndivided them, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave\nthem to the people.  And there was plenty for everybody.  Jesus made\nthose loaves and fishes last out till everybody had had enough.  And\nthen He said, 'Gather up the fragments (that means the little pieces)\nthat are left, that nothing be lost.'  And the disciples picked the\nlittle pieces up, and put them together in baskets.  And there were\ntwelve large baskets full--more than they had at first.  There were\nfive thousand men in that grassy place, and a great many women and\nchildren besides.  And when the people saw the miracle that Jesus had\ndone they said, 'THIS MUST BE THE MESSIAH;' and they wanted to make Him\ntheir king--the king of their country, but not the king of their hearts.\n\nJesus did not wish to be made a king like Herod or Caesar.  He was God,\nso He was King of kings already.  He made His disciples go away at once\nin the boat to the other side of the lake, and He sent the crowds away\nHimself.  When Jesus was alone, He went up into a mountain and prayed.\nBut now a great wind began to blow, and the waves on the Sea of Galilee\nbegan to toss about.  The disciples rowed hard, but they could not get\non; the wind kept trying to blow them back.  But Jesus saw them, and\nwhen the night was nearly over, He came to them walking on the sea.\nThe disciples had never seen Him walking on the water before, and they\ncould not understand who He was, and they cried out for fear.  But\nJesus was sorry for them, and He spoke kindly to them directly and\nsaid, 'BE OF GOOD CHEER (that means, 'Be glad').  IT IS I.  BE NOT\nAFRAID.'\n\nAnd Peter said, 'Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the\nwater.'  And Jesus said, 'Come.'  And Peter jumped out of the boat, and\nwalked on the water to go to Jesus.  But soon Peter began to think of\nthe rough wind and waves instead of thinking about Jesus, and then he\ncould not get on at all, and he began to sink in the water, and called\nbut, 'Lord, save me!'  And Jesus put out His hand and caught him, and\nsaid, 'O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?'  Then they\nboth came into the boat, and the wind stopped blowing.  And the\ndisciples fell down at the feet of Jesus, and said 'THOU ART THE SON OF\nGOD.'  Then, all at once, they saw that their boat was close to the\nland.  Jesus had brought it there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMORE WONDERFUL WORKS AND WORDS\n\nAnd now Jesus went right away from the Sea of Galilee again to Caesarea\nPhilippi.  That place was called Caesarea after Augustus Caesar,\nEmperor of Rome, and Philippi after Herod Philip.  When they were going\nto Caesarea Philippi, Jesus talked quietly to His disciples, and said,\n'Whom do you say that I am?'  Peter almost always spoke first, before\nthe others had time to say anything, and he said quickly, 'THOU ART THE\nCHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD.'  Jesus was very much pleased with\nthat answer.\n\nThen Jesus called the people who stood near, and His disciples too, and\nHe told them that if they followed Him, they too might have to die for\nHis sake.  But He told them that they must not mind that, because\nheaven is better than this world.  And He told them that if they were\nashamed of Him, He should be ashamed of them before His Father and the\nholy angels.  Dear children, I hope, when you go to school, or are with\nyour little friends, that you will never be ashamed of Jesus.\n\nAbout a week after that talk with His disciples, Jesus took Peter, and\nJames, and John into a high hill alone to pray.  There is a splendid\nhigh mountain near Caesarea Philippi, called Hermon.  All at once, as\nJesus was praying, the disciples saw that His face shown like the sun,\nand His clothes were white and shining like the light.  And as the\ndisciples looked, they saw two men talking with Jesus, called Moses and\nElijah, two holy men who went to heaven long, long ago.  We do not know\nhow long they talked.  Peter, and James, and John were men, so they\ncould not look very long at those heavenly visitors; soon their eyes\nclosed, and they fell fast asleep.  When they woke up, Moses and Elijah\nwere still there, and when the disciples saw Jesus again, looking so\nbright and beautiful, they were very much afraid.\n\nWhen they came down from the mountain, they saw a crowd down below.\nJesus had left nine of His disciples behind when He went up Mount\nHermon; and now He saw a great number of persons all round them, and\nheard some Jews worrying them with questions.  When Jesus came near\nenough to speak, He asked what was the matter.  And a man came running\nto Him out of the crowd, and begged Him to look at his boy--his only\nchild.  And he said to Jesus, 'If Thou canst do anything, take pity on\nme, and help me.'  And Jesus made the boy well from that very hour.\nThe disciples had not had faith enough themselves to be able to do that\nsick boy any good.\n\nEvery year the Jews had to pay half a shekel of money for the splendid\nTemple in Jerusalem; and when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the men who\nwere collecting the money came to Peter, and said, 'Does not your\nMaster pay the half-shekel?'  And Peter said, 'Yes.'  Now the Temple\nwas God's house, and Jesus was God's Son.  And Jesus explained to Peter\nwhen he came into the house that kings did not expect their own sons to\npay them taxes.  But it was not wrong to pay the half-shekel, and Jesus\nnever vexed people if He could possibly help it, so He said to Peter,\n'Go thou to the sea and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first\ncometh up, and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a piece\nof money.  That take, and give unto them for Me and thee.'\n\nAnd now, after a long time, Jesus and His disciples went up to\nJerusalem again; and as they walked along, they saw ten lepers standing\na long way off.  As Jesus came near, they cried out, 'Jesus, Master,\nhave mercy on us.'  Nine of the lepers were Jews, and one was a\nSamaritan.  And Jesus was sorry for them all, and said, 'Go, show\nyourselves to the priests.'  So they turned straight round to go to the\npriests, and lo! as they were going along the road, they suddenly felt\nthat they were strong and well again.  When the Samaritan felt in\nhimself that the leprosy had gone away, he turned back, and threw\nhimself down at the feet of Jesus, and thanked Him, and thanked God too\nfor all His goodness.  But none of the nine Jews came back to thank\nJesus.\n\nA few days after that a man came to Jesus, and asked how he could get\nto heaven.  Jesus said that he must love God with all his heart, and\nhis neighbor as himself.  Then the man said, 'Who is my neighbor?'  So\nJesus told him this story, THE GOOD SAMARITAN: 'A certain man went down\nfrom Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him\nof his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.\nAnd by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he\nsaw him, he passed by on the other side.  And likewise a Levite, when\nhe was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other\nside.  But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and\nwhen he saw him, he had compassion on him.  And went to him, and bound\nup his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast,\nand brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  And on the morrow\nwhen he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and\nsaid unto him, 'Take care of him: and whatsoever thou spendest more,\nwhen I come again, I will repay thee.'  When Jesus had finished that\nstory, He said, 'Which now of these three was neighbor unto him that\nfell among the thieves?'  You can answer that question, and can go and\ndo like that good Samaritan.\n\n[Illustration: The good Samaritan.]\n\nJust opposite the Temple hill, Mount Moriah, there was another hill,\ncalled the Mount of Olives.  On the other side of the Mount of Olives\nwas a village, called Bethany, and Jesus often walked over the hill to\nsee some friends of His there, a brother and two sisters who lived in\nthe village.  Their names were Mary and Martha and Lazarus.  Jesus\nloved them very much, and they loved Him.  But Mary and Martha showed\ntheir love in very different ways.  Mary sat as quiet and still as\npossible when Jesus came in, and listened to every word that He said;\nand Martha wanted so much to make Him happy and comfortable that she\nran about the whole time doing things for Him, instead of listening to\nthe beautiful words He was saying.\n\n[Illustration: Bethany.]\n\nJesus likes you and me to work for Him; but He likes us to talk to Him\nin prayer too, and to listen to the things that He whispers in our\nhearts, and to the words that He says to us in the Bible.\n\n[Illustration: Child at prayer.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE MAN BORN BLIND, AND LAZARUS.\n\nOne Sabbath day, most likely the next Sabbath day after the Feast of\nTabernacles, Jesus saw a blind beggar out of doors.  That poor man had\nalways been blind.  He had never been able to see at all.  Jesus spat\non the ground, and put the wet earth on the blind man's eyes, and said,\n'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.'  And the man went and washed, and\ncame back able to see.  The people who met him began to ask him, 'How\nwere thine eyes opened?'  And the man told them.  Then they wanted to\nknow where Jesus was.  But the man did not know that.  Then the people\nbrought him to the Pharisees to see what they would say.  And the\nPharisees said, 'How is it that you can see now?'  And the man told\nthem.\n\nThen the Pharisees turned him out of the synagogue.  Jesus heard about\nthat, and He came to the lonely man, and said, 'Dost thou believe on\nthe Son of God?'  And the man said, 'Who is He, Lord, that I might\nbelieve 'on Him?'  And Jesus said to him, 'THOU HAST BOTH SEEN HIM, AND\nHE IT IS THAT TALKETH WITH THEE.'  Then the man fell down at the feet\nof Jesus, saying, 'Lord, I believe.'\n\nAnd now Jesus turned to the Pharisees, and told them that _they_ were\nvery blind.  They could see things with their eyes, but they could not\nsee that their hearts were full of sin.  Then Jesus preached one of the\nmost beautiful of all His sermons.  In it He said, 'I am the Door of\nthe sheep; by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved.  I am the Good\nShepherd; the Good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep.  I am the\nGood Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine; and I lay down\nMy life for the sheep, And other sheep I have which are not of this\nfold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there\nshall be one flock under one Shepherd.'\n\n[Illustration: The shepherd's care (2nd version).]\n\nThe 'other sheep' Jesus spoke about meant the Gentiles, the people who\nare not Jews.  It meant you and me, and it meant all the heathen.  He\nhas called us.  He is calling the heathen.  And many sheep, many quiet\nlittle lambs, have heard the voice of Jesus, and are following Him.\nHave you heard Him calling you?  Have you followed Him? if not, oh,\nmake haste to go after Him now.\n\nSoon after Jesus had gone away from Bethany, His friend Lazarus became\nvery ill.  Martha and Mary longed for Jesus now, and they thought, 'If\nJesus were here, our brother would not die;' and they sent a messenger\nto Him to say 'Lord, he whom Thou lovest is sick.'  When Jesus heard\nthat, He stayed on quietly where He was for two days longer.  Then He\ncame to Bethany, and by this time Lazarus had been in the grave for\nfour days.  Presently somebody came to Martha, and said to her quietly,\n'Jesus is coming.'  When Martha heard that, she got up, and went out to\nmeet Him.  And when she saw Jesus, she said, 'Lord, if Thou hadst been\nhere, my brother would not have died; but I know that even now whatever\nThou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.'  Jesus said to her, 'Thy\nbrother shall rise again.'  When Jesus saw how unhappy Mary and Martha\nwere, He too felt very sad, and said, 'Where have ye laid him?'  And\nthey said, 'Lord, come and see.' And then----Jesus wept.  'See how He\nloved Lazarus,' said the Jews; and they wondered that Jesus had let His\nfriend die.\n\nNow they had come to the grave.  It was a hole in the side of a rock,\nand there was a heavy stone over it.  Jesus said, 'Take ye away the\nstone;' and they rolled it away.  Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and\nthanked God that He had heard His prayer and given Him back the life of\nLazarus.  And then He cried with a loud voice, 'Lazarus, come forth.'\nAnd the man who had been dead came out of the cave alive.  When the\nJews saw what was done, some of them believed, but others hurried off\nto Jerusalem to make mischief as fast as they could.\n\nAfter a time Jesus crossed the Jordan and again came into Perea, and\nthen He came slowly down through Perea to Jerusalem.\n\n[Illustration: The shepherd's care (3rd version).]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE PRODIGAL SON, AND OTHER STORIES.\n\nOne day, when the mothers of Perea brought their little ones to Jesus,\nthe disciples found fault with them for coming, and tried to keep them\naway.  But when Jesus saw what the disciples were doing He was much\ndispleased, and said to them--\n\n'SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN, AND FORBID THEM NOT, TO COME UNTO ME: FOR OF\nSUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.'\n\nAnd He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed\nthem.\n\nJesus used to tell some very beautiful stories as He went slowly\nthrough the Holy Land.  We have not room for all, but I must tell you\ntwo or three, and I will tell you them exactly as Jesus first told them.\n\n'A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his\nfather, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.  And\nhe divided unto them his living.\n\n'And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and\ntook his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance\nwith riotous living.\n\n'And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land;\nand he began to be in want.  And he went and joined himself to a\ncitizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.\nAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine\ndid eat: and no man gave unto him.  And when he came to himself, he\nsaid, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to\nspare, and I perish with hunger!  I will arise and go to my father, and\nwill say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before\nthee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy\nhired servants.\n\n'And he arose and came to his father.  But when he was yet a great way\noff, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran and fell on his\nneck, and kissed him.\n\n'And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and\nin thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\n\n'But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and\nput it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and\nbring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be\nmerry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and\nis found.'\n\nTHE STORY OF THE UNMERCIFUL SERVANT.\n\nAt another time Jesus said--\n\n'Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which\nwould take account of his servants.  And when he had begun to reckon,\none was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  But\nforasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and\nhis wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.\n\n'The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord,\nhave patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n\n'Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed\nhim, and forgave him the debt.\n\n'But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants,\nwhich owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him\nby the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.\n\n'And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying,\nHave patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n\n'And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should\npay the debt.\n\n[Illustration: The Jordan near Bethabara.]\n\n'So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry,\nand came and told unto their lord all that was done.  Then his lord,\nafter that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I\nforgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not\nthou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity\non thee?  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,\ntill he should pay all that was due unto him.\n\n'So likewise shall my Heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your\nhearts forgive not every one his brother.'\n\nJesus often told beautiful parables: here are two--\n\nTHE STORY OF THE TARES.\n\n'The kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in\nhis field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among\nthe wheat, and went his way.\n\n'But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then\nappeared the tares also.\n\n'So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst\nnot thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?\n\n'He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.\n\n'The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them\nup?'\n\n'But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also\nthe wheat with them.  Let both grow together until the harvest: and in\nthe time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first\nthe tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat\ninto my barn.'\n\nTHE STORY OF THE TEN VIRGINS.\n\n'Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which\ntook their lamps, and went forth to meet the bride-groom.\n\n'And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.  They that were\nfoolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took\noil in their vessels with their lamps.\n\n'While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\n\n'And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh;\ngo ye out to meet him.\n\n'Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.  And the\nfoolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone\nout.\n\n'But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us\nand you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.\n\n'And while they went to buy, the bride-groom came; and they that were\nready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.\n\n'Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.\n\n'But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.\nWatch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the\nSon of Man cometh.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE LAST DAYS IN JERUSALEM.\n\nWhen it was time for Him to end His work on earth, Jesus started for\nJerusalem.  The people in Jerusalem heard that He was coming, and\ncrowds of them poured out of Jerusalem to meet Him.  They carried\nboughs of palm trees in their hands, and waved them, and cried,\n'HOSANNA!  BLESSED BE THE KING THAT COMETH IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!\nPEACE IN HEAVEN, AND GLORY IN THE HIGHEST.'\n\nPresently Jesus came to a part of the Mount of Olives where He could\nsee Jerusalem and the Temple straight before Him; and as He looked at\nthem, He wept aloud.  He wept because they loved their sins, and hated\ntheir Saviour.  He wept because He knew that God would have to punish\nthem.  He knew that in a very few years the Romans would come and fight\nagainst Jerusalem, and burn down that Temple, and kill thousands of the\nJews, or carry them away as slaves.  Were not these things enough to\nmake the Lord Jesus weep?\n\n[Illustration: Mount of Olives and Jerusalem.]\n\nThe blind and the lame came to Jesus in the Temple, and He made them\nwell; and when the little children cried, 'HOSANNA TO THE SON OF\nDAVID,' He was pleased to hear their song.  But the priests were very\nangry.  'Hosanna to the Son of David' means 'Save us, Jesus, our King.'\nThe priests could not bear to hear the children call Jesus their King,\nand ask Him to save them.  And Satan is very angry now when He hears a\nlittle child say, 'Save me, O Jesus, my King.'  But Jesus is pleased.\n\nDuring these last days Jesus stayed quietly each night at Bethany; but\nthe priests were very busy thinking how they could take Him prisoner,\nand they were very pleased when Judas came in secretly, and said, 'Give\nme money, and I will give you Jesus.'  And the priests said they would\ngive Judas thirty pieces of silver if he would give Jesus up to them.\nThirty pieces of silver!  Why, that was only about seventeen dollars\n($17)--only as much as used to be paid for a slave.\n\nThe next day while Jesus stayed quietly in Bethany, Peter and John were\nvery busy, for Jesus had sent them to Jerusalem to get ready for the\nPassover.  They had to take a lamb to the Temple to be killed by the\npriests, and they had to find a house in which to eat the Passover\nsupper.\n\nOnce every year the Jews used to kill a lamb, and pour out its blood\nbefore God, to show that they remembered God's goodness to them when\nthey were in Egypt, in letting his angel pass over their houses.  And\nthen they roasted the lamb, and met together in their houses to eat it,\nand to thank God for all his love and kindness.\n\nWhen Peter and John had got the Passover supper quite ready, Jesus came\nfrom Bethany with the rest of His disciples, and they all sat down\ntogether at the table; and Jesus told the disciples that He was very\nglad to eat this Passover with them, because it was the very last time\nHe would eat and drink at all before He died.  Then Jesus took off His\nlong, loose outside dress, and He wrapt a towel round Him, and poured\nwater into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe\nthem with the long towel which He had fastened round His waist.\n\nWhen Jesus had finished washing His disciples' feet, He put on His long\ncoat again (it was called an _abba_), and sat down.  And He told His\ndisciples that He had given them an example, so that they might be kind\nto one another, and wait upon one another.\n\nJesus said many beautiful words to His disciples that night at the\nsupper; and when the supper was finished, they went out into the Mount\nof Olives, to a place called Gethsemane, a garden full of olive trees,\nwhere Jesus often went to pray.\n\nWhen Jesus came to Gethsemane with His disciples, He told them to sit\ndown and wait for Him while He went on farther to pray.  But He took\nwith Him Peter and James and John.  As they walked on, Jesus began to\nbe so very sorrowful that He wanted to be quite alone with God.  So He\ntold Peter and James and John to stay behind and to watch.  But they\nwent to sleep.  And then Jesus went a little way off, and fell down on\nHis knees and prayed.  And now His mind was in such pain that He\nsuffered agony, and the sweat rolled down His face in drops of blood.\nThen Jesus came to Peter and James and John, and found them fast\nasleep.  Twice Jesus went away and prayed the same prayer, and twice He\ncame back to find His disciples asleep.\n\n[Illustration: Gethsemane.]\n\nAnd now a great crowd poured into the garden.  Judas was walking first,\nto show the others the way, and he came up to Jesus and kissed Him\nagain and again, and said, 'Master!  Master!  Peace!'  And when the\npeople saw Judas do that, they took hold of Jesus and held Him fast.\nThey took Jesus first to the house of a priest called Annas, and then\nto the palace of Caiaphas the high priest; and John, who knew somebody\nin that house, was allowed to come in.  Peter was left outside; but\nsoon John asked the girl at the door to let Peter in too.  Peter was\nglad to come in to see what was being done to his dear Master.\n\nThe houses in the East are built round a great square court, like a big\nhall, only it has no roof.  It was the middle of the night, and the\ncold air blew into that court.  But the servants had made a great fire\nof coals in the middle of the court, and while Jesus was standing\nbefore Caiaphas and the other priests, the servants sat round that fire\nwaiting, and warming themselves.  Peter came and sat down with the\nservants, and warmed himself too.\n\nPresently the girl who attended to the door came up to the fire, and\nshe had a good look at Peter, and said, 'And you were with Jesus of\nNazareth.  Are you not one of His disciples?'  Then Peter told a lie\nbefore all the servants, and said, 'Woman, I am not.  I do not know\nHim, and I do not know what you mean.'  And he went on warming himself,\nand tried to look as though he knew nothing in the world about Jesus.\nBut Peter loved Jesus too much to be able to do this well.  He was\nunhappy, he could not sit still; he got up, and went away into a place\nnear the door, called the porch, and when he was in the porch he heard\na cock crow.  Perhaps he went into the porch because he thought that it\nwould be dark there and that nobody would see him.  But the girl who\nkept the door told another woman to look at him, and that woman said to\nthe people who stood by, 'This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth, and\nis one of His disciples.'  Then a man who stood there said to Peter,\n'Are you not one of His disciples?'  And again Peter told a lie, and\nsaid, 'Man, I am not.  I do not know the Man.'\n\nAn hour passed by, and then some of the people near said, 'You must be\none of the disciples of Jesus.  The way that you speak shows that you\ncome from Galilee.'  While Peter was again denying him, Jesus turned\nround, and looked upon Peter.  And Peter remembered what Jesus had said\nto him, 'Before the cock crow twice, you will say three times you do\nnot know Me.'  And when he thought about what he had done, he was very,\nvery sorry; and he went out of the high priest's palace, and wept\nbitterly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE CRUCIFIXION AND THE RESURRECTION\n\nWhen the morning came, the priests met once more with all the chief\nJews, and said Jesus must die.  But the Jews could not put anyone to\ndeath.  The Romans would not allow it.  So they took Jesus to the Roman\ngovernor, whose name was Pontius Pilate.\n\nWhen Judas saw that the priests had made up their minds to kill Jesus,\nhe began to feel very unhappy.  He did not care for the money now.  He\ncame to the Temple, and brought it back to the priest, and said, 'It\nwas very wrong of me to give Jesus up to you.  He had done nothing\nwrong.'  But their hearts were as hard as stone.  They said to Judas,\n'What is that to us?  See thou to that.'  Then Judas had no hope left.\nHe flung the thirty pieces of silver down in the Court of the Priests,\nand went and hung himself.  But oh! what a pity that he did not go to\nJesus and ask Jesus to forgive him, instead of going to the priests!\nJesus is a good, kind, loving Master.  When we do wrong, if we are very\nsorry, like Peter, and will come and ask Jesus, He will forgive us.  For\n\n'THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S SON, CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN.'\n\nPilate took Jesus inside his splendid palace, away from the Jews, and\nasked Him, 'Art thou a King then?'\n\n'Yes,' Jesus said, 'but My kingdom is not of this world.  I came into\nthis world to teach people the truth.  That is the reason I was born.'\n\n'What is truth?' said Pilate.  But he did not wait for an answer.  He\nwent out again to the Jews.\n\nWhen the Jews saw Pilate again, they began to tell him lies which they\nhad been making up about Jesus.  And Jesus stood by and said nothing.\nPresently Pilate said to Jesus, 'See what a number of things they are\nsaying against you.  Have you nothing to say?'\n\nBut Jesus did not answer one single word, and Pilate was greatly\nsurprised.  He felt sure that the quiet prisoner was right and that the\nJews were wrong; and he said to the priests and to the people, 'I find\nin Him no fault at all.'\n\nIt was the custom for Pilate at Passover time to set free from prison\nany one prisoner the people liked to ask for.  So Pilate said to the\ncrowd, 'Shall I let Jesus go?'  Then the priests told the people what\nto say, and they shouted, 'Not this man, but Barabbas.'\n\nPilate wanted very much to let Jesus go, and he said, 'What shall I do\nthen with Jesus?'\n\nThe crowd shouted, 'Let Him be crucified!  Crucify Him!  Crucify Him!'\n\n'Why,' said Pilate, 'what has He done wrong?  He does not deserve to\ndie.  I will scourge Him and let Him go.'\n\nThen the people cried out more loudly than ever, 'Let Him be crucified!\nCrucify Him!'\n\nBut Pilate did not want to be shouted at for five or six days and\nnights again.  And, besides, he rather wanted to please the Jews if he\ncould, because he had done many things to vex them; so he thought, 'I\nwill do what they wish.'  But first he had a basin of water brought,\nand he washed his hands before all the people, and said, 'I have\nnothing to do with the blood of this good Man.  See ye to it.'  And all\nthe people answered and said, 'His blood be on us, and on our\nchildren.'  Sometimes now, when we don't want to have anything to do\nwith a thing, we say, 'I wash my hands of it.'  But Pilate did have\nsomething to do with the death of Jesus, and water would not wash away\nthat sin.\n\nAnd at last, wishing to please them, Pilate had Barabbas brought out of\nprison, and gave Jesus up to be beaten.  The Roman soldiers seized\nJesus, and took off His clothes and put a scarlet dress on Him, to\nimitate the Emperor's purple robe; and they twisted pieces of a thorny\nplant which grows round Jerusalem into the shape of a crown, and put it\non His head; and they put a reed in His hand for a sceptre.  And then\nall the soldiers fell down before Jesus, and said, 'Hail, King of the\nJews.'  And then they spit at Jesus, and slapped Him; and they snatched\nthe reed out of His hands and struck Him on the head, so as to drive in\nthe thorns.\n\nOutside the city gate, on the north side of Jerusalem, there is a round\nhill, called the Place of Stoning.  On one side of that hill there is a\nstraight yellow cliff, and prisoners used sometimes to be thrown down\nfrom that cliff, and then stoned.  And sometimes they were taken to the\ntop of that round hill and crucified.  It is very likely that this is\nwhere the soldiers took Jesus.  That hill is often called Calvary.\n\nThe soldiers made Jesus lie down on the cross, and they nailed Him to\nit--putting nails through His hands and His feet.  Then they lifted up\nthe cross with Jesus on it, and fixed it in a hole in the ground.  And\nJesus said,\n\n'FATHER, FORGIVE THEM; FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.'\n\nThen the soldiers crucified two thieves, and put them near Jesus, one\non each side; and they nailed up some white boards at the top of the\ncrosses with black letters on them, to say what the prisoners had done.\nThey put over Jesus Christ's head the words--\n\n'THIS IS JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.'\n\nThree hours of fearful pain passed away.  It was twelve o'clock.  And\nnow it became quite dark and it was dark till three o'clock in the\nafternoon.  That was a dreadful three hours more for Jesus.  It was a\ntime of agony of mind, like the time He spent in the Garden of\nGethsemane.  He was having His last fight with Satan, and He felt quite\nalone.  When it was about three o'clock, Jesus cried out with a loud\nvoice, 'It is finished.'  And He cried again with a loud voice, and\nsaid, 'Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit.'  And He bowed His\nhead and died.\n\n[Illustration: Calvary.]\n\nAnd now wonderful things happened.  The ground shook; the graves\nopened; dead people woke up to life again; and a great veil, or\ncurtain, which hung before the most holy part of the Temple, was\nsuddenly torn into two pieces.  The high priest used to go once a year\ninto that Most Holy Place to offer sacrifice for sin before God.  But\nwhen the great purple and gold curtain was torn down without hands, it\nwas just as if a voice from heaven had said, 'No more blood of lambs,\nno more high priest is wanted now.  Jesus, the real Passover Lamb, has\nbeen sacrificed.  Jesus has offered His own blood before God for\nsinners, and God will forgive every sinner who trusts in the blood of\nJesus.'\n\nThen a rich man, called Joseph, came to Pilate and begged Pilate to let\nhim have the body of Jesus to bury.  Pilate said that Joseph might have\nthe body of his Master.  And Joseph came and took it down from the\ncross; and he and Nicodemus wrapped the body round with clean linen,\nwith a very great quantity of sweet-smelling stuff inside the linen.\n\nThere was a garden close to the place where Jesus was crucified, and in\nthat garden there was a grave which Joseph had cut in a rock.  The\ngrave was not like those which we have.  It was a little room in the\nrock, with a seat on the right hand, and a seat on the left, and with a\nplace in the wall just opposite the door for the body.  Joseph and\nNicodemus laid the body of Jesus in this new grave.  Then they came\nout, and rolled a great round stone over the door, and went away.\n\nJesus was crucified on Friday, and now it was Sunday.  It was very\nearly in the morning.  The soldiers were watching at the grave of\nJesus, and all was still; when suddenly the earth began to tremble and\nshake.  And behold, an angel came down from heaven, and rolled away the\nstone at the door of the tomb, and the Lord of Life came out.  The\nsoldiers did not see Jesus, but they did see the shining angel.  The\nRoman soldiers shook with fright.  They were so frightened that they\nhad no strength left in them, and as soon as they could they ran away\nfrom the place.\n\nAnd now that the soldiers had gone, some women came near--Mary\nMagdalene, Mary the mother of James, Joanna, Salome, and at least one\nor two more women.  They had brought with them some sweet-smelling\nspices, which they had made or bought, to put round the body of Jesus.\nThe light was beginning to come in the sky, to show that the sun would\nbe up soon, but it was still rather dark.  As the women came along,\nthey said one to the other, 'Who will roll away the stone for us from\nthe door of the tomb?'  For it was very great.  Then they looked, and\nbehold! the stone was gone.  And Mary Magdalene ran back to the city,\nto tell Peter and John that the door of the tomb was open.  But the\nother women went on, and went into the tomb where they had seen Jesus\nlaid.  He was not there now, but an angel in a long white robe was\nsitting on the right-hand side of the tomb.  Then the women saw two\nangels standing by them in shining clothes, and they were afraid, and\nfell on their faces to the ground.  Then one of the angels said to\nthem, 'Fear not.  He is not here; He is risen.'\n\n[Illustration: The empty tomb.]\n\nBut Mary Magdalene after all had been the first to see Jesus.  She had\nrun off to tell Peter and John that the stone was rolled away.  As soon\nas Peter and John knew that, they ran off to the grave as fast as they\ncould, and Mary Magdalene went after them.  John could run the fastest,\nso he got there first, and just peeped in through the little door in\nthe rock.  The angels had gone away, but he could see the linen\nbandages.  They were not thrown about here and there, but they were\nlying neatly together.  But when Peter came up he wanted to see more\nthan that, and he went straight into the tomb, and John followed him.\nWhen Peter and John saw that the body of Jesus had really gone, they\nwent away back to the city and told the other disciples.\n\nBut Mary Magdalene did not go back.  As she turned away from the grave\nshe saw that somebody was standing near the grave.  It was really\nJesus, but she did not know that.  She was too sad to look up.\n\nAnd Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why weepest thou?  Whom seekest thou?'\n\nMary thought, 'It is the gardener,' and she said, 'Sir, if you have\ncarried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him\naway.'\n\nThen Jesus said, 'Mary.'  And Mary turned round quickly, and said,\n'Master.'  Then she saw that it was Jesus, and He sent her with a\nmessage to His disciples.  So Mary hurried back again into the city\nwith her good news.  She found the disciples, and when she said, 'I\nhave seen the Lord,' they would not believe it.  And when some other\nwomen who had met Jesus a little later came in, and said, 'We have seen\nthe Lord,' it was just the same.  The disciples only thought, 'What\nnonsense these women talk!'  Before the women came in, two of the\ndisciples had gone for a very long walk.  As they walked along, and\ntalked, Jesus came near, and went with them.\n\nWhile Jesus talked and the disciples listened, they came to the village\nof Emmaus.  That was the end of the disciples' journey, and now Jesus\nbegan to walk on by Himself.  But the disciples begged Him to stay with\nthem, 'Abide with us,' they said; 'it is getting late.  It will soon be\nevening.'  So Jesus went in, and sat down at table with them.  And He\ntook bread in His hands, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to\nthem.  Perhaps Jesus had some special way of saying grace which made\nthe disciples know who He was.  Anyway, they knew Him now.  And then,\nsuddenly, He was gone.  Cleopas and his friend could not keep their\ngood news to themselves.  They got up at once, and went back, more than\nseven miles, to Jerusalem, and found a number of the Lord's friends and\ndisciples sitting together at supper.  Some of them were saying, 'THE\nLORD IS RISEN INDEED.'\n\nThen Jesus Himself came to them, and He told them that it was very\nwrong not to believe.  Then, when He saw that they were frightened, He\nsaid, 'Peace be unto you,' and He showed them His hands and His feet,\nand ate some fried fish and honey which they had put on the table for\nsupper.  That was to make them understand that His body was really\nalive as well as His soul.  And now the disciples were filled with\ngladness and Joy.\n\nThen Jesus told them the same things that He had been explaining to\nCleopas and his friend, and He said to them--\n\n'AS MY FATHER HATH SENT ME, EVEN SO SEND I YOU.  GO YE INTO ALL THE\nWORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.'\n\nThat is the great missionary text.  A missionary means, you remember,\n'one who is sent.'  That text was meant for you and for me, as well as\nfor the first disciples of Jesus.\n\nAfter these things, the eleven disciples went away to Galilee, and\nwaited for Jesus to meet them there.\n\nOne day Thomas and Nathanael, and James and John, and two other\ndisciples, were together by the side of the Sea of Galilee.  Peter was\nthere too, and he always liked to be doing something, so he said to the\nothers, 'I go a-fishing.'  And they said, 'We will also go with you;'\nand at once they all jumped into a little ship, and pushed off into the\nlake.  But that night they caught nothing.\n\n[Illustration: The Sea of Galilee.]\n\nNext morning Jesus came and stood on the shore.  The disciples could\nsee Him, because the little ship was now pretty near to the land, but\nthey did not know Him.  Jesus said to the men in the boat, 'Children,\nhave you anything to eat?'\n\nThey thought, I suppose, that this stranger wanted to buy some fish,\nand they said, 'No.'  Then Jesus said, 'Cast the net on the right side\nof the ship, and you shall find.'\n\nAnd the disciples did what Jesus had said, and at once the net became\nso heavy with fish that the fishermen could not pull it into the boat.\n\nThen John said to Peter, 'It is the Lord.'\n\nWhen Peter heard that, he jumped into the water, so as to get quicker\nto land.  The other disciples stayed in the boat, and dragged the fish\nalong after them.  When the boat got to land, Peter helped the other\nmen to pull the net in.  It was full of great fishes--a hundred and\nfifty and three.  Jesus had got a fire of coals ready on the beach, and\nsome bread; and some fish were broiling on the fire.  And now Jesus\nsaid to the tired fishermen, 'Come and dine,' and He waited upon them\nHimself.\n\nAfter that day by the Sea of Galilee, the disciples went to a mountain\nwhich Jesus told them about.  And Jesus met them there, and said to\nthem, 'Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  AND LO I AM WITH YOU\nALWAY, EVEN UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD.'  There is another splendid\nmissionary text.\n\n[Illustration: The Mount of Olives.]\n\nJesus stayed on earth for forty days, and when the forty days were\nover, He went for a last walk with His disciples.  He took them the way\nthey had so often gone together--over the Mount of Olives, and so far\nas Bethany.  There He stopped, and lifted up His hands, and blessed\nthem.  And it came to pass, that while He blessed them, He was taken\nfrom them, and carried up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand\nof God.  As the disciples looked up earnestly towards heaven after\nJesus, two angels in white robes came and stood by them, and said, 'YE\nMEN OF GALILEE, WHY DO YOU STAND LOOKING INTO HEAVEN?  THIS SAME JESUS\nWHICH IS TAKEN UP FROM YOU INTO HEAVEN SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE SAME WAY\nAS YOU HAVE SEEN HIM GO INTO HEAVEN.'\n\nYes, dear children, Jesus is coming again some day.  He will not come\nas a little baby next time.  He will come as a King, to cast out Satan,\nto judge the world, and to take away all who love Him to be with Him\nforever.\n\n\n\n\n  \"SAVIOR, LIKE A SHEPHERD, LEAD US.\"\n\n  Savior, like a shepherd, lead us,\n    Much we need Thy tend'rest care,\n  In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,\n    For our use Thy folds prepare.\n  Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,\n    Thou hast bought us, Thine we are.\n\n  We are Thine, do Thou befriend us,\n    Be the Guardian of our way;\n  Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,\n    Seek us when we go astray.\n  Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,\n    Hear, O hear us, when we pray.\n\n  Thou hast promised to receive us,\n    Poor and sinful though we be;\n  Thou hast mercy to relieve us,\n    Grace to cleanse, and power to free.\n  Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,\n    We will early turn to Thee.\n\n\n\n  \"ONE THERE IS ABOVE ALL OTHERS.\"\n\n  One there is, above all others,\n    Well deserves the name of Friend;\n  His is love beyond a brother's,\n    Costly, free, and knows no end.\n\n  Which of all our friends, to save us,\n    Could or would have shed his blood?\n  But our Jesus died to have us\n    Reconciled in him to God.\n\n  When he lived on earth abas\u00c3\u00a9d,\n    Friend of sinners was his name;\n  Now above all glory rais\u00c3\u00a9d,\n    He rejoices in the same.\n\n  Oh, for grace our hearts to soften!\n    Teach us, Lord, at length, to love;\n  We, alas! forget too often\n    What a friend we have above.\n\n\n\nTHE LORD'S PRAYER\n\nOur Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

      " before the world was made, the Lord Jesus lived in\nheaven.  He lived in that happy place with God.  Then God made the\nworld.  He told the hills to come up out of the earth, and the seas to\nrun down into the deep places which He had made for them.  He made the\ngrass, the trees, and all the pretty flowers.  He put the sun, the\nmoon, and the stars in the sky.  He filled the water with swimming\nfish, the air with flying birds, and the dry land with walking and\ncreeping animals.  And then He said, 'Let _Us_ make man.'  Who were\nmeant by 'Us'?  Who was with God when He made the world?  It was Jesus.\nThe Bible says:\n\n'THE WORD (that means Jesus) WAS WITH GOD, AND THE WORD WAS GOD.  THE\nSAME WAS IN THE BEGINNING WITH GOD.  ALL THINGS WERE MADE BY HIM.'\n\nSo after He had made everything else, God made a man, and named him\nAdam.  God put Adam into the beautiful Garden of Eden, and at first he\nwas good and very happy.  God also made a woman,",
      " named Eve, to be his\nwife, and to help him to take care of the garden.  All the fruit in the\ngarden, except what grew on one tree, was given to Adam and Eve to eat;\nall the animals were their servants; and God was their Friend.\n\nA wicked angel, who had been turned out of heaven, saw how happy Adam\nand Eve were, and he was angry, and thought, 'I will make them as bad\nand unhappy as I am; I will make them do what God has told them not to\ndo.  Then he will turn them out of Eden, and they and their children\nwill be my servants for ever, and I shall be king of the world.'\n\nSo the wicked angel, whose name was Satan, came into Eden.  He got Adam\nand Eve to take the fruit which God had told them not to eat, and God\nhad to send them out of the beautiful garden; for God had said He would\npunish Adam and Eve if they took that fruit, and God always keeps His\nword.\n\nBut God went on loving Adam and Eve even when He knew that He must\npunish them, and He tried to make them good in this way.  He thought,\n'I will send My dear Son down to the earth.",
      "  He shall become a little\nchild, and grow up to be a man, and shall die for the sins of the\nworld.'\n\nHundreds and hundreds of years passed away before Jesus came.  But a\ngreat many of the people who lived in Palestine were expecting Him.\nGod had said that when Jesus came, He would be a Jew.  The Jews were\nvery proud about that.  They often talked about the coming of Jesus.\nWhen they talked about Him, they called Him the Messiah.\n\nJust before Jesus was born, the Jews were very unhappy.  Roman soldiers\nhad been fighting with them, and had conquered them, and made them\nservants of the great Roman king.  He was called Augustus Caesar, and\nhe gave the Jews another king called Herod.  He was very wicked.\n\n[Illustration: Map of Palestine at the time of Christ.]\n\nThe Jews longed to get rid of Herod, and many of them thought, 'It will\nbe all right when the Messiah comes.  The Messiah will fight against\nthe Romans; He will drive them away from our land; and then He will be\nour King instead of that wicked Herod.'  But only a few Jews remembered\nthat Jesus was coming to fight against Satan and against sin.\n\nThe place where the Jews lived had four or five names.",
      "  It was called\nthe Land of Canaan at the first, then the Land of Promise, and then the\nLand of Israel.  But we call it the Holy Land, or Palestine.\n\nIf you look at the map of Palestine, you will see a river running from\nthe north of Palestine to the south.  That river is called the Jordan.\nAnd Palestine is divided into four parts,--one at the top (we call that\nthe north), one at the bottom (we call that the south), one in the\nmiddle, and one on the other or eastward side of the Jordan.\n\nThe part in the North is called Galilee.  The part in the south is\ncalled Judaea.  The part in the middle is called Samaria.  The part on\nthe other side of the Jordan is called Perea.\n\nPalestine is full of hills, with great holes, called caves, in their\nsides.  Palestine is not very big; England is about six times, and New\nYork State about five times larger.  Washington is called the capital\nof the United States.  The capital of Palestine was Jerusalem.\n\nJerusalem was a very beautiful city.  It was built on four or five\nhills which were very close together.",
      "  One of these hills was called\nMount Moriah.  On the top of Mount Moriah there was a great Temple\nwhere the Jews went to pray.  Part of the Temple was called the Holy\nPlace, the part at the very top of the mountain.  It was splendid with\nits shining gold and white marble, but it was not very large, for the\npeople were not allowed to go into it.  When it was time for the Jews\nto go to the Temple, silver trumpets were blown once, twice, three\ntimes, and then the gates were thrown open, and the people crowded into\nthe courts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nJESUS IS BORN IN BETHLEHEM\n\nMary, the mother of Jesus, lived in the little town of Nazareth, among\nthe hills of Galilee.  She was going to be married to a carpenter\ncalled Joseph, who, like herself, lived in Nazareth.  One day God sent\nthe angel Gabriel to Mary with a message.  Mary, when she saw and heard\nthe angel, was a little frightened.  But the angel told her he had some\nglad news for her.  Jesus, the Son of God, the Messiah, was coming into\n",
      "the world very soon, and He was to come in the form of a baby, as\nMary's little child.  And Gabriel said that when He was born, Mary must\ncall Him JESUS.\n\nMary had a cousin named Elizabeth, who lived more than a hundred miles\naway from Nazareth, and Mary longed to talk with her about all these\nwonderful things.  So she got ready for a long journey, and went off\ninto the hill country of Judaea to see Elizabeth.\n\nAnd God had also promised to send Elizabeth a son.  And soon after\nMary's visit the baby was born, and all Elizabeth's friends were glad,\nand came to see her, and to thank God with her for His great kindness.\n\nThe little Jew babies have a name given to them when they are eight\ndays old.  And Elizabeth's son was named John.\n\nOne night, soon after Mary got back from her cousin Elizabeth's house,\nthe angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph in a dream.  The angel told\nJoseph to marry Mary, and he told him Mary's secret about the Son of\nGod coming to earth as her little child, and he said to Joseph, 'THOU\nSHALT CALL HIS NAME JESUS,",
      " FOB HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR\nSINS.'  When Joseph woke up, his first thought was to do what the angel\nhad told him, and he at once took Mary to his own home as his wife.\n\nAbout this time Caesar Augustus, the great Emperor at Rome, sent word\nto Herod that he was to take a census of the Jews.  Everybody's name\nhad to be written down and his age, and many other things about him.\nEvery twenty years Augustus had a census taken, so that he might know\nhow much money the Jews ought to pay him, and how many Jew soldiers he\nought to have.\n\nIn Palestine, at census time, people had to go to the towns where their\nfathers' fathers lived a long time ago, and had to have their names put\ndown there instead of having them put down in their own homes.  Now,\nboth Joseph and Mary belonged to the family of the great king David,\nwho was born in Bethlehem.  So Mary had to prepare for a long journey,\nand go with her husband to Bethlehem.  Bethlehem is six miles from\nJerusalem.  It is on the top of a hill, and people have to climb up a\nsteep road to get into the town.\n\nAn inn is a large house that people stay at when they are on a journey.\nThe inns in Palestine have four walls,",
      " with a door in front, and with a\ngreat empty space for camels and horses inside.  In the middle of the\nempty space is a fountain; and all round the walls, a little bit higher\nthan the part where the animals are, there are a number of places like\nempty stone arbors.  These empty places are called _leewans_, and they\nare open in front, so that everybody can see into them.  Yet Mary and\nJoseph, after all their long journey from Nazareth, could not find even\nan empty _leewan_ to lie down in.\n\n[Illustration: The shepherd's care.]\n\nNear that inn there was a place in which asses and camels were kept.\nIt was perhaps a cave in the side of the hill.  And because there was\nno room for them in the inn, Mary and Joseph had to go into that stable\nto sleep, and in that stable Jesus Christ was born.  Mary wrapped Him\nin swaddling clothes, and laid Him in the manger in the place where the\nanimals' food was kept.\n\nOn the hill where Bethlehem stands there are green places where\nshepherds feed their flocks.  There are wild animals in Palestine; and\n",
      "all night long the shepherds of Bethlehem watched to see that no harm\nhappened to their sheep.  One night an angel of the Lord stood by them\nand a bright light shown round about them.  The shepherds were afraid;\nbut the angel said, 'FEAR NOT; FOR BEHOLD, I BRING YOU GOOD TIDINGS (OR\nNEWS) OF GREAT JOY, WHICH SHALL BE TO ALL PEOPLE.  FOR UNTO YOU IS BORN\nTHIS DAY IN THE CITY OF DAVID A SAVIOUR, WHICH is CHRIST THE LORD.'\nAnd suddenly there was seen with the angel a number of the angels of\nheaven.  And they praised God, and said, 'GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST,\nAND ON EARTH PEACE, GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN.'\n\nWhen the light faded, and the song ended, and the angels had gone back\ninto heaven, the shepherds climbed quickly over the hillside to\nBethlehem.  And there, in the stable near the inn, they found Mary and\nJoseph, and the Babe lying in the manger, as the angels had said.\n\nJesus was the eldest son of His mother.  And the eldest sons in Jewish\n",
      "houses, when they were forty days old, were taken to the Temple, and\ngiven to God.\n\nSo now, when Jesus was nearly six weeks old, He was brought from\nBethlehem by Mary and Joseph to the Temple at Jerusalem.  The mothers\nused to take a lamb with them, or two pigeons, as a sacrifice to God.\nMary took two pigeons.  She was not rich enough to buy a lamb.\n\nA long way on the eastern side of the Jordan, there were countries\nwhere the people used to watch the sun and the moon and the stars very\ncarefully.  If they saw anything new and strange in the heavens, they\nthought it meant that something wonderful was going to happen.  But\nsome of them knew and had heard from the Jews about God, and about the\nMessiah who was coming; and they, like the Jews, were longing for Jesus.\n\nOne day these wise men saw a bright star which they had never seen\nbefore.  And as they looked at it they felt sure that a great King of\nthe Jews had been born in Judaea.  So they took camels and rich\npresents of gold and sweet-smelling stuff--such as people gave to kings\nin those days--and they loaded their camels,",
      " and left their homes, and\nrode for many weeks till they came to Jerusalem.  And when they got\nthere they said, 'Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we\nhave seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him.'\n\n[Illustration: Bethlehem.]\n\nWhen Herod heard about these wise men he was troubled.  He sent for the\nbest priests, and other clever men, and asked them where Christ would\nbe born.  And they said to him, 'In Bethlehem of Judaea.'  They had\nread that in the Bible.  Then Herod said to the wise men, 'Go and\nsearch out carefully about the young Child; and when ye have found Him,\nbring me word, that I also may come and worship Him.'\n\nWhen the wise men had heard the king, they went away to Bethlehem, and\nlo, the star went before them, till it came and stood over where the\nyoung Child was.  And they rejoiced with great joy.  And when they were\ncome into the house (there was room in the inn now) they saw the young\nChild with Mary, His mother, and they fell down and worshipped Him, and\nthey gave Him their presents--gold,",
      " and frankincense, and myrrh.  But\nthe wise men did not go back to Herod.  God told them in a dream not to\ngo.  So they went home by another way instead.\n\nAfter the wise men were gone, the angel of the Lord came to Joseph in\nhis sleep, and said to him, 'Arise, and take the young Child and His\nmother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word:\nfor Herod will seek the young Child to destroy Him.'  That meant to\nkill Him.  So Joseph at once got up, and took the young Child and His\nmother by night, and went away to Egypt.\n\nWhen Herod found that the wise men did not come back, he was very\nangry, and he sent his soldiers to Bethlehem, and had all the baby boys\nkilled--all the children who were less than two years of age.  And they\nkilled all the baby boys in the places near Bethlehem as well.  And the\npoor mothers cried, and nobody could comfort them.\n\nJoseph and Mary stayed in Egypt, waiting for the angel to bring them\nword that it was time to go back again to Palestine.  And one night,\nwhen Jesus was about three years old,",
      " the message came.  The angel of\nthe Lord said to Joseph in a dream, 'Arise, and take the young Child\nand His mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which\nsought the young Child's life.'  Joseph got up, and took the young\nChild and His mother, and went into the land of Israel.  But when he\ncame there, people said to him, 'Herod is dead, but his son Archelaus\nis king.'  And when Joseph knew that Archelaus was king, he was afraid\nto stay in Judaea.  And God spoke to him again in a dream, and told him\nto go back to Galilee.  So Joseph and Mary went back to Galilee, and\nlived in Nazareth again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE BOYHOOD OF JESUS\n\nThe Bible tells us only a few stories about the time when Jesus was a\nlittle boy.\n\nNazareth is built up the side of a hill, and there are plenty of\ngardens and fields down below.  Amongst these fields there is a\nfountain, where the women of Nazareth go to fetch water.  Jesus must\noften have gone with His mother to that fountain;",
      " and sometimes, when\nshe was tired, He may have fetched the water for her Himself.\n\n[Illustration: Nazareth, from hill above.]\n\nMary wore a long blue dress, tied round the waist, and a cap with\npieces of money sewn round it, and a white cloth over her head and\nshoulders, just as the women of Nazareth do now; and Jesus was very\nlikely dressed in a red cap, a bright tunic, a sash of many colours,\nand a little jacket of white or blue, just as the boys of Nazareth are\ndressed now.\n\nThe houses of Nazareth are white.  Grape vines grow over their walls,\nand doves sit and coo on the flat roofs.  There is not much inside the\nhouses: sometimes they have only one room.  There is a lamp in the\nmiddle of the room, and round the walls there are waterpots.  There are\nbright-coloured quilts on a shelf.  People unroll these quilts at night\nand lie down upon them.  There are mats and carpets in the house, and a\nbright-coloured box with treasures in it, and a painted wooden stool;\nand that is nearly all.\n\n[Illustration:",
      " Jewish women grinding corn.]\n\nWhen the people of the house want to eat, they put a tray of food on\nthe wooden stool, and they sit round the tray on the floor, and eat\nwith their hands.  People in Palestine would not know what to do with\ntables and chairs, and knives and forks, like ours.\n\nThe streets of Nazareth are long and narrow, and they are full of\nchickens and dogs, of donkeys and camels, of blind beggars and\nchildren.  There are little shops by the side of the streets, something\nlike the _leewans_ in the inn which I told you about.  But the tailors,\nthe shoemakers, the carpenters, and the coffee-grinders do not always\nsit in their shops.  They like to sit on the ground outside, and do\ntheir work in the street; and the sellers of dates and of figs, beans,\nbarley, oranges, and other things, sit down in the street to sell their\ngoods.\n\nJoseph, Mary's husband, was a carpenter, and Jesus became a carpenter,\nand often came out of the little shop and sat on the ground with plane,\nhammer, glue, and saw,",
      " and worked away in the narrow street, just as\nthe carpenters of Nazareth do now.\n\nWhen the Jewish boys were twelve years old, they were called 'Sons of\nthe Law,' and they were taken to Jerusalem for the Passover.  When\nJesus was twelve years old, Joseph and His mother took Him up with them\nto the Passover.  When the week was over, Mary and Joseph started for\nthe journey back to Nazareth.  But Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem.\nThousands of people must have been leaving Jerusalem just at the very\ntime that Mary and Joseph went away.  So when Mary and Joseph did not\nsee Jesus in the crush, they did not at first feel frightened.  They\nthought, 'We shall find Him soon with some of our friends.'  All day\nlong they kept on looking for Him in the crowd, but they did not see\nHim.  And at last they went back again to Jerusalem looking for Him.\n\nNext day they found Him in one of the courts of the Temple.  Several\nRabbis were there, and everyone who saw and heard Him was astonished.\nThey asked Him questions too, and He answered them wisely and well.\nNobody could understand how a young boy could be so wise.\n\nWhen Mary and Joseph saw Jesus sitting here,",
      " with Rabbis coming all\naround Him, they were greatly surprised.  But His mother asked Him why\nHe had stayed behind, and said, 'Thy father and I have sought Thee\nsorrowing.'  Jesus said to His mother, 'HOW IS IT THAT YE HAVE SOUGHT\nME?  WIST YE NOT (DID YOU NOT KNOW) THAT I MUST BE ABOUT MY FATHER'S\nBUSINESS?'\n\nAnd now He went back with her and with Joseph to Nazareth, and obeyed\nthem, exactly as He always had done.  We do not know much more about\nJesus when He was a boy.  But we do know that as He grew taller, He\n'increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJOHN THE BAPTIST\n\nYou remember about the child that was called John.  Zacharias, his\nfather, and Elisabeth gave John to God directly he was born.  They\nnever cut his hair, and they never let him drink wine, or eat grapes,\nor eat raisins.  That was the way they did in those days to show that\nhe belonged to God.\n\nWhen John was old enough to understand, he gave himself to God.",
      "  And as\nhe grew older, he made up his mind that he would leave his home and\nfriends, and go and live in the wilderness; and his food there was\nlocusts and wild honey.  Locusts are like large grasshoppers, and poor\npeople in the East often eat them.  They taste like shrimps, but are\nnot so nice.\n\nGod had said that John should go before the Messiah to prepare the way\nfor Him--to get people's hearts ready for the Saviour.  And when John\nwas in the wilderness, God told him to begin his work.  So John went\ndown from the wild hills of Judaea to the River Jordan, and he began to\npreach to everyone who passed by.  There were many people passing by,\nfor he went to the place where people crossed the Jordan.\n\n[Illustration: The River Jordan.]\n\nJohn said, REPENT!' (that means, 'Be really sorry for your sins'), 'FOR\nTHE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is AT HAND.'  A very great many people went from\nJerusalem, and out of all the land of Judaea, on purpose to hear John\npreaching.  And when they had heard him,",
      " some of them said to him,\n'What shall we do then?'  And John told them that they were to be kind\nto one another; that they were to give food to the hungry and clothing\nto the naked.\n\nSome even of the proud Rabbis came down to the Jordan to John, and John\ntold these Rabbis that they must not be proud because they were Jews,\nbut must try to be good really and truly.\n\nA great many of the people who heard John preach felt sorry for the\nthings they had done, and they told John how sorry they were, and John\nbaptized them in the River Jordan.  John told the people that he could\nonly baptize their bodies with water, but that some one else was coming\nwho would be able to baptize their hearts with the Holy Spirit.  This\nwas Jesus.\n\n[Illustration: Jericho, from plains above.]\n\nAfter John had baptized a great many persons, he saw coming to him, one\nday, for baptism, a Man about thirty years old; and when John looked at\nHim, he saw that He was quite different from all the people who had\nbeen to him before.  It was Jesus who had come to be baptized before He\n",
      "began His work.  He wanted to obey God in everything; and He wanted to\nshow that He was the Brother and Friend of all the people whom John had\nbeen baptizing.  And so, as Jesus wished it, John went into the River\nJordan with Him and baptized Him.\n\nWhen Jesus had been baptized, and was full of the Holy Spirit, He went\naway into a wilderness.  And there, when Jesus was tired and hungry,\nSatan came to Him--just as he came to Adam and Eve in the Garden of\nEden--to tempt Him.\n\nTo tempt means to try.  Mother tries you sometimes, to see whether you\ncan be trusted; and God tries us all sometimes.  But if God tries us,\nit is to make us better; and if Satan tries us, it is to make us worse.\n\nEvery time that Jesus was tempted, He said, 'It is written,' and then\nHe told Satan something 'which was written in the Bible.  That is the\nvery best way to fight Satan.  The Bible is called 'the Sword of the\nSpirit,' and Satan is afraid when he sees us using that Sword.  Let us\nask God to fill us, like Jesus, with the Holy Spirit,",
      " and then we shall\nsoon learn how to use the Sword of the Spirit, and we too shall be able\nto drive Satan away when he comes to tempt us.\n\nOnly we must be sure to read the Bible, as Jesus used to do, or else we\nshall never be able to drive Satan away by telling him the things that\nGod has written there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nJESUS BEGINS HIS WORK\n\nOne day, when the fight of Jesus with the devil in the wilderness was\nover, He came to Bethabara, where John was baptizing, and when John saw\nJesus coming towards him, he said:\n\n'BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD, WHICH TAKETH AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD.'\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus again, and again he said the same words:\n\n'BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD!'\n\nJohn called Jesus the Lamb of God, because He had come to die for our\nsins.\n\nTwo men were standing close to John when Jesus came by, and they heard\nwhat he said.  The name of one of these men was Andrew, and of the\nother John.  Jesus knew that they would like to speak to Him, so He\nturned round and asked them what they wanted.",
      "  'Master,' they said,\n'where dwellest Thou?' (that means 'where are you living?')  Jesus\nsaid, 'Come, and you shall see.'  And He took the two disciples to His\nhome, and He let them stay with Him the whole of the day.  What a happy\nday that must have been!\n\nAndrew had a brother called Simon, and he went and found him, and told\nhim that he had found the Messiah, and brought him to see his new\nMaster.  So now Jesus had three disciples--John, Andrew, and Simon; and\nnext day He took them away with Him to Galilee.  While they were going\nalong, Jesus saw a man called Philip, who came from the place where\nSimon and Andrew lived when they were at home.  Jesus told Philip to\ncome with Him, and he came.  But Philip went to a friend of his, a very\ngood man called Nathanael, also called Bartholomew, and he told him\nthat he had found Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah, and begged him to\ncome and see Him.\n\nHow many disciples had Jesus now?  Let us see.  John, Andrew, Simon,\nPhilip,",
      " and Nathanael--five.  And very likely John had brought his\nbrother James to Jesus.  If so, that would make six.\n\nDirectly Jesus came into Galilee He was invited to a wedding, at a\nplace called Cana, and all of His disciples with Him.  Jesus went to\nthe wedding because He likes to see people happy, and loves to make\nthem happy.  In America, people often drink more wine at weddings and\nat other times than is good for them, and a great many people go\nwithout any wine at all, so as to set a good example.  But in the East\nit is different.  The people there hardly ever take too much wine.  So\nJesus allowed His disciples to use it, and He drank it Himself.  There\nwas some wine at the wedding party to which Jesus went; but presently\nit came to an end.  Then Mary came to Jesus, and said, 'They have no\nwine.'  Jesus knew what Mary was thinking about, but He had to tell her\nto wait; and He had to make Mary understand that He could not do\neverything now which she told Him to do, exactly as when He was a boy.\nHe was God's Son as well as Mary's,",
      " and He had God's work to do, and He\nmust do it at God's time.\n\n[Illustration: A modern Jew's wedding party in Galilee.]\n\nBut when Mary went back, she told the servants to do whatever Jesus\ntold them.  Close to the house there were six great stone jars or\nwaterpots, and Jesus said to the servants, 'Fill the waterpots with\nwater.  And they filled them up to the brim.  And lo! when the water\nwas taken out of the jars, it was water no longer, but wine.\n\nThis was the very first miracle that Jesus did, and He did it to make\npeople happy, and to make them believe that He was the Son of God.\nDear children, Jesus wants you to be happy.  And the best way to be\nhappy is to ask Jesus to go with you everywhere and always, just as\nthose wedding people asked Him to come to their party.\n\nHe did not stay very many days in Capernaum.  The lovely spring flowers\ntold Him that the Passover time was coming, so He went up with His\ndisciples, to Jerusalem.  When Jesus had come to Jerusalem, you may be\nsure that His disciples and He soon went to the Temple,",
      " and when they\ngot inside the great Court of the Gentiles they found a market was\ngoing on there.  Men were selling oxen and sheep and doves for\nsacrifice.  Others were sitting at little tables changing money.  And\nthere must have been plenty of noise, for people in the East shout and\nquarrel a great deal when they are buying or selling.\n\nWhen Jesus saw this, He was angry; and He made a whip with pieces of\ncord, and He drove away all the people who were selling in the Temple.\nAnd He turned out the sheep and the oxen; and he told the men who sold\ndoves to take them away, and not turn His Father's House into a store.\nJesus upset the tables of the money-changers too, and poured out their\nmoney.\n\nJesus did a great many wonderful things when He was in Jerusalem that\nPassover time, and many persons saw His miracles, and thought, 'Yes,\nthis is the Messiah.'  But Jesus did not trust any of those people.  He\nknew that they did not really love Him.  But there was one man in\nJerusalem who did want to be Jesus Christ's disciple.  His name was\nNicodemus.",
      "  He was a great Rabbi, but not proud like the other Rabbis,\nand he wanted to ask Jesus a great many questions.  But he did not want\nthe other Rabbis and the priests to see him coming to Jesus.  So he\ncame to Jesus by night--in the dark.\n\nDid Jesus say, 'You are not brave, Nicodemus, I am ashamed of you; go\naway'?  Ah no!  He talked kindly to him, and He told him that he would\nhave to be born again.  He meant that Nicodemus must ask God to send\nhim His Holy Spirit, and to give him a new heart.  And then Jesus\nexplained to Nicodemus why He had come down from heaven.  He said:\n\n'GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT\nWHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHOULD NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING\nLIFE.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSOME WORDS AND WORKS OF JESUS\n\nJesus having to go to Galilee, made up His mind to pass through\nSamaria.  It was a long, rough journey, and at last they came near a\n",
      "town called Sychar.  Near by was the well dug by Jacob when he lived in\nShechem.  Jesus was so tired that He sat down to rest on the edge of\nthe well, while His disciples went on to buy food.\n\n[Illustration: Jacob's well.]\n\nWhile Jesus was sitting by the well, a woman came there to draw water.\nJesus asked her to do something kind for Him, He said 'Give Me to\ndrink.'  The woman was surprised, and said to Him, 'You are a Jew, and\nI am a Samaritan.  Why then do you ask me for water?'\n\nJesus said, 'IF YOU KNEW WHO I AM, YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED ME, AND I WOULD\nHAVE GIVEN YOU LIVING WATER.'  Jesus meant the Holy Spirit.  He gives\nthe Holy Spirit to everyone who asks Him.\n\nThen Jesus spoke to the woman about the bad things she had done, and\nshe tried to make Him talk about something else.  But she could not\nstop His wonderful words.  At last she said, 'I know that the Messiah\nis coming.  He will tell us all things.'  Then Jesus said to her, 'I\nTHAT SPEAK UNTO THEE AM HE.'\n\nJust then His disciples came up to the well,",
      " and they were very much\nastonished to see Him talking to the woman.  The Jew men were too proud\nto talk much to women, even if the women were Jews; and this was a\nSamaritan.  But the disciples did not ask Jesus any questions about why\nHe talked to the woman.  They brought Him the things they had been\nbuying, and said, 'Master, eat.'  But Jesus was so happy that He had\nbeen able to speak good words to that poor woman that He did not feel\nhungry any more.  He told His disciples that doing God's work was the\nfood He liked best.\n\nAfter this Jesus lived for awhile first at Nazareth, and then at\nCapernaum.  There was a boy ill in Capernaum just then with a fever.\nIt is so hot near the Sea of Galilee that the people who live there\noften get fever.  That sick boy's father was rich, but money could not\nmake the dying boy well.  His father had heard of Jesus, and when he\nknew that Jesus had come into Galilee, and that He was only a few miles\naway, he came to Him, and begged Him to come down to Capernaum and make\n",
      "his child well.  At first Jesus said to him, 'You will not believe on\nMe unless you see Me do some wonderful thing.'  But when He saw how\neager the poor father was, He thought He would try him, and He said to\nhim, 'Go thy way, thy son liveth.'  Directly Jesus said that, the man\nfelt sure in his heart that his boy was well.  He did not ask Jesus any\nmore to come with him, but he just went back home quietly by himself.\n\nNext day, as he was going down the long hilly road from Cana to\nCapernaum, some of the servants from his house came to meet him, and\nthey said to him, 'Thy son liveth.'  Then the father asked them what\ntime it was when the boy began to get better, and said, 'Yesterday, at\nthe seventh hour (that means at one o'clock) the fever left him.'  Then\nthe father knew that that was the very time when Jesus had said to him,\n'Thy son liveth,' and he and all the people in the house believed in\nJesus.\n\nThe Jews could not bear paying taxes to the Romans, and they hated the\n",
      "publicans.  They would not eat with them or talk with them.  But Jesus\ndid not hate the publicans.  He only hated the wrong things they did.\nSo one day, when He was outside the town of Capernaum, and saw Matthew\nsitting and taking the taxes, He said to him, 'Follow Me.'  And Matthew\ngot up from his work, and at once left all and followed Jesus.\n\nJesus often told His disciples beautiful stories.  One day He told them\na story to teach them not to be proud like the Pharisees.  'Two men\nwent up into the Temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a\npublican.  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I\nthank Thee that I am not as other men are; I thank Thee that I am not\neven as this publican.  Twice a week I go without food, and I give away\na great deal of money.  But the publican, standing afar off, would not\nlift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast,\nsaying, God be merciful to me, a sinner.  When the publican went home\n",
      "that night he was better and happier than the Pharisee.  The Pharisee\n_thought_ he was good; he did not want to be forgiven, and so God let\nhim carry all his sins back home with him again.  But the publican\n_knew_ he was a sinner, and was sorry, and so God forgave his sins.'\n\nWhile Jesus was in Capernaum, He went every Sabbath day to teach in the\nsynagogue.  One day a man shouted out--\n\n'What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?  I know Thee who\nThou art, the Holy One of God.'\n\nSatan had put an unclean spirit, or devil, in that man.  Jesus was not\nangry with the poor man, but He spoke to the unclean spirit, and said,\n'Be silent, and come out of him.'  He came out, and the man became\nwell.  The people in the synagogue were greatly surprised.  They said,\n'What thing is this?  He commandeth even the unclean spirits and they\nobey Him.'\n\nWhen the service was over, the people who had seen the miracle went\nhome, and talked to everybody about what they had seen.",
      "  Some of them\nhad sick friends, and some had friends with unclean spirits, and they\nlonged to bring them to Jesus.  But it was the Sabbath, and they would\nnot bring them until the evening, at which time their Sabbath came to\nan end.  So as soon as the sun set that Sabbath day, a great crowd was\nseen standing round Peter's house.  It seemed as if all the people of\nCapernaum must be there!  They had brought their sick friends, and laid\nthem down at the door.  And Jesus put His hands on the sick people, and\nhealed them all.\n\nIn the east there is a dreadful illness called leprosy, and the people\nwho have it are called lepers.  No doctor can cure it.  At the time\nwhen Jesus lived on the earth, lepers were not allowed to come into\ncities.  And they had to go about with nothing on their heads, and with\ntheir dresses torn, and with their mouths covered over; and when they\nsaw anybody coming, they had to call out, 'Unclean! unclean!'\n\nOne day when Jesus went into a town a leper saw Him.  The poor man came\n",
      "to Jesus and knelt down before Him, and fell on his face.  And he said,\n'If Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.'  And Jesus put out His hand,\nand touched him, and said to him, 'I will; be thou clean.'  And as soon\nas Jesus had said that, the leper was well.\n\nSin is just like leprosy.  A baby's naughtiness does not look very bad;\nbut that naughtiness spreads and gets stronger as baby gets older, and\nnobody but Jesus can take it away.\n\nJesus Christ's body must often have felt very tired, for crowds\nfollowed Him about all the time.  They came from Perea, and from\nJudaea, and from other places too, to see the wonderful new Teacher.\nAnd Jesus preached to them all, and healed their sicknesses.  The most\nwonderful sermon that was ever preached in all the world is called the\nSermon on the Mount, because Jesus sat down on a hill to preach it.\n\nAfter a time Jesus went up again to Jerusalem.  In or near Jerusalem\nthere was a spring of water which was as good as medicine, because it\nmade sick people well if they bathed in it often enough.",
      "  This spring\nran into a bathing-place called the Pool of Bethesda.  Numbers of sick\npersons came to bathe in that pool.  One Sabbath day Jesus saw quite a\ncrowd there.  Some were blind, some were lame, some were sick of the\npalsy.  They were sitting, or lying, by the side of the pool.  Jesus\nwas very sorry for one poor man there.  He had been ill thirty-eight\nyears.  So Jesus said to the man, 'Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.'\nAnd at once the sick man was well, and took up his mattress and walked.\n\nNow the Rabbis had a number of very silly rules about the Sabbath day.\nEven if a man broke his arm or his leg on the Sabbath the Rabbis would\nnot allow the doctor to put the bone right till the next day.  So they\nwere very angry when they found that Jesus had made that poor man well\non the Sabbath day, and had told him to carry his mattress home.  They\ntold the man he was doing very wrong, and they tried to kill Jesus.\nBut Jesus told them that His Heavenly Father was never idle, and that\nHe must do the same works as God.",
      "  That made the Rabbis more angry than\never.  They said, 'He calls God His own Father, making Himself equal\nwith God.'  From that time the Jews in Jerusalem made up their minds\nmore than ever to kill Jesus; and wherever He went they sent men to\nwatch Him and listen to His words, so that they might make up some\nexcuse for putting Him to death.\n\nWhat kind of work does God do on Sunday, dear children?  Why, He does\nall sorts of kind and beautiful things.  He makes the sun rise, and the\nflowers grow, and the birds sing; and He takes care of little children\non Sunday exactly the same as he does on other days.  And Jesus did the\nsame kind of work, He made people happy and well on the Sabbath.  And\nwe may do _works of love_--kind, loving things for other people--on\nSunday.\n\nAnother Sabbath day, soon after that, the Lord Jesus and His disciples\nwere walking through a cornfield.  The disciples were hungry, so they\nrubbed some corn in their hands as they went along, and ate it.  Some\nof the Pharisees saw the disciples, and they were shocked;",
      " and they\nspoke to Jesus about it.  But Jesus told the Pharisees that the\ndisciples were doing nothing wrong.  He said, 'THE SABBATH WAS MADE FOR\nMAN, AND NOT MAN FOR THE SABBATH; THEREFORE THE SON OF MAN IS LORD ALSO\nOF THE SABBATH DAY.'  Jesus meant that God gave the Sabbath day to Adam\nand his children as a beautiful present, to be the best and happiest\nday of all the seven.  God meant it as a rest for our souls and bodies.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA FRIEND FOR THE SORROWFUL\n\nOne day Jesus went to a town called Nain (or Beautiful), about\ntwenty-five miles from Capernaum.  A great crowd of people followed\nJesus and His disciples; and when they came near to the gate of the\ncity of Nain, they saw a funeral coming out.  The dead body of a young\nman was being carried out on a bier to be buried.\n\nWhen Jesus saw the poor mother crying and sobbing, He felt very sorry\nfor her, and He said to her, 'Weep not.'  And Jesus came and touched\nthe bier, and the men who were carrying it stood still.",
      "  And Jesus\nsaid, 'Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.'  And life came back into\nthat dead body again.  He that was dead sat up and began to speak.  And\nJesus gave him back to his mother.\n\nA Pharisee, called Simon, once asked Jesus to come and have dinner with\nhim.  When anyone in that land went to a feast, the master of the house\nused to kiss him, and say, 'The Lord be with you,' and put some sweet\nsmelling oil on his hair and beard, and the servants used to bring the\nvisitor water to wash his feet.  But none of those kind things were\ndone to Jesus when He came to that Pharisee's house.  Presently Jesus\nand Simon began to eat.  In that country, people often _lay_ down to\neat.  Broad settees, or couches, were put round the table, and the\nvisitors used to lie down in rows on these settees.  Their heads were\nnear the table, and their feet were the other way.  They lay down on\ntheir left side, and they had cushions to put their elbows on, so that\nthey could raise themselves up while they were eating.",
      "  While Jesus and\nSimon were at dinner, a woman came in out of the street.  In the East,\npeople walk in and out of other people's houses just as they like.  But\nthat woman had been very wicked, and Simon was not pleased when he saw\nher come in.  But nobody said anything to her.  So she came to Jesus,\nand stood at His feet, behind the couch on which He w as lying, and\ncried till the tears ran down her face.  Then as her tears dropped on\nto the feet of Jesus, she stooped down and wiped them away with her\nlong hair.  And then she kissed the feet of Jesus many times, and put\nprecious sweet-smelling ointment upon them.  Perhaps she had heard some\nbeautiful words which Jesus had just been saying to the people out of\ndoors--\n\n'COME UNTO ME, ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN, AND I WILL GIVE\nYOU BEST.'\n\nHer sins were like a heavy load, and so she had come to Jesus.\n\nBut Simon thought to himself, 'If Jesus had really come from God, He\nwould have known how wicked this woman is, and He would not have\n",
      "allowed her to touch Him.'\n\nJesus knew what Simon was thinking, and He said that once upon a time\nthere were two men who owed some money.  One owed a great deal of\nmoney, and the other owed a little.  But when the time came for them to\npay the money they could not do it.  And the kind man forgave them both.\n\nJesus then asked Simon which of the two men would love that kind friend\nmost.\n\nSimon said, 'I suppose he to whom he forgave most.'\n\nJesus said that that was quite right.  Then He turned to the woman, and\nsaid to Simon: 'Seest thou this woman?  I came into thine house; thou\ngavest Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with tears,\nand wiped them with the hairs of her head.  Thou gavest Me no kiss, but\nthis woman, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss My feet:\nMy head with oil thou didst not anoint, but she hath anointed My feet\nwith ointment.  I say unto thee, her sins, which are many, are\nforgiven, for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven,",
      " the same\nloveth little.'  And then Jesus said to the woman, 'THY SINS ARE\nFORGIVEN.  THY FAITH HATH SAVED THEE.  GO IN PEACE.'  And she left her\nheavy load of sin with Jesus, and took away instead the rest and peace\nHe gives.\n\nAfter Jesus had finished all the work He wanted to do in Nain, He went\nagain into every part of Galilee to tell people the good news that a\nSaviour had come.\n\nJesus preached to the crowds out of a boat.  He told them most\nbeautiful stories.  They liked these stories so much that they did not\ncare to go away--not even when it was evening.  But Jesus and His\ndisciples needed rest, so Jesus told the disciples to go over to the\nother side of the lake.\n\nWhen the boat started, Jesus was so tired that He lay down at the end,\nout of the way of the men who were rowing, and put His head upon a\npillow, and fell fast asleep.  Soon the wind began to blow, and it blew\nlouder and louder.   Then the waves curled over and dashed into the\nboat till the boat was nearly full.",
      "  But still Jesus slept quietly on.\nThe disciples were afraid that their boat would sink, and they came to\nJesus, and woke Him, and said, 'Master!  Master! we perish!  Lord,\nsave!'  And Jesus arose, and told the wind to stop, and He said to the\nsea, 'Peace, be still.'  And suddenly the wind stopped, and the sea was\nquite smooth.  Then Jesus said gently to His disciples, 'Where is your\nfaith?'  Those disciples might have known that the boat could not sink\nwhen Jesus was in it.\n\n[Illustration: Ruins of Capernaum.]\n\nWhen Jesus came back to Capernaum, a man, called Jairus, fell down at\nHis feet and begged Him to go to his house, where his little girl,\nabout twelve years old, was dying.  So Jesus and His disciples started\nto go to Jairus' house, and a great crowd of people went with Him.  But\nwhile they were going, someone came to Jairus, and said, 'It is of no\nuse to trouble the Master any more.  The child is dead.'  But Jesus\nsaid to him quickly, 'Do not be afraid.",
      "  Only believe, and she shall be\nmade well.'\n\nWhen Jesus came to the house of Jairus, He heard a great noise.  As\nsoon as anyone dies in the East, people come to the house, and cry and\nhowl, and play wretched music.  They are paid to do that.  That was the\nnoise which Jesus heard, and he asked, 'Why do you make this ado?  The\nlittle maid is sleeping.'  And those rude people laughed at Jesus, just\nas if He did not know what He was talking about.  So Jesus turned them\nall out.\n\nThen Jesus took three of His disciples--Peter, and James and John--and\nJairus and his wife; and they went together to look at the child.\nThere she was, lying quite still.  Life had flown away from her body.\nBut Jesus took hold of the girl's hand, and said, 'My little lamb, I\nsay unto thee, Arise.'  And life flew back to her body again, and she\nopened her eyes and got up, and walked.  And Jesus told her father and\nmother to give her something to eat.\n\nWhen Jesus came out of Jairus' house,",
      " two blind men followed Him,\nbegging Him to make them well.  Jesus waited till He had got back to\nthe house where He was staying and then He touched their eyes, and made\nthem see.\n\nJust about this time Jesus had some very sad news.  Herod Antipas, the\nson of wicked King Herod, had shut up John the Baptist in a prison,\ncalled the Black Castle, by the side of the Dead Sea.  Part of that\ncastle was a beautiful palace, with lovely furniture and a coloured\nmarble floor.  One day Herod gave a grand birthday party.  Herod had\nmarried a very wicked woman, who was at the party.  Her name was\nHerodias.  Herodias hated John the Baptist, because he had said that\nshe ought not to be Herod's wife.  So she made up her mind to have John\nthe Baptist killed.  Herodias had a daughter called Salome, who danced\nbeautifully.  And on that birthday Herod was so pleased with Salome's\ndancing that he said, 'I will give you anything you ask me for.'\nSalome went to her mother, and said, 'What shall I ask?'  And Herodias\n",
      "said, 'Ask for the head of John the Baptist.'  And Salome came back\nquickly and said, 'I want the head of John the Baptist.'\n\nNow, it is wrong to break a promise.  But it is not wrong to break a\n_wicked_ promise.  It is wrong ever to have made it.  Herod was sorry,\nbut he was afraid of what other people in the party would think if he\ndid not do what he had said.  So he sent his soldiers to the prison,\nand had John the Baptist's head cut off to give to that dancing-girl.\n\nJesus had sent His twelve disciples out to preach to people He could\nnot go and see Himself.  When they came back they had a great deal to\ntalk about, and they were very tired.  But there were always so many\npeople coming to see Jesus that they could get no quiet time at all, no\ntime even to eat.  They were all at the Lake of Galilee again, and\nJesus told them to come away with Him into a desert place, and rest\nawhile.  That desert place was near a town called Bethsaida, where\nPeter, and his brother Andrew, and Philip lived once upon a time.\n\nJesus and His disciples got into a boat as quietly as they could,",
      " and\nwent away.  But some people near the lake caught sight of the boat, and\nthey saw who was in it; and they ran so fast along the shore of the\nlake that they got to the desert before Jesus was there.  Jesus felt\nvery sorry for these people, and He began to teach them many things.\nBy and by it got late, and Jesus said to the disciples, 'How many\nloaves have you?  Go and see.'  And Andrew said, 'There is a boy\nherewith five barley loaves and two fishes; but what are they among so\nmany?'  And Jesus told him to bring the loaves and fishes.  Then Jesus\nsaid, 'Make the people sit down.'  So the disciples arranged the crowds\nin rows on the grass.  And when every one was ready, Jesus took the\nfive loaves and the two fishes in His hands, and He blessed them, and\ndivided them, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave\nthem to the people.  And there was plenty for everybody.  Jesus made\nthose loaves and fishes last out till everybody had had enough.  And\nthen He said, 'Gather up the fragments (that means the little pieces)\nthat are left,",
      " that nothing be lost.'  And the disciples picked the\nlittle pieces up, and put them together in baskets.  And there were\ntwelve large baskets full--more than they had at first.  There were\nfive thousand men in that grassy place, and a great many women and\nchildren besides.  And when the people saw the miracle that Jesus had\ndone they said, 'THIS MUST BE THE MESSIAH;' and they wanted to make Him\ntheir king--the king of their country, but not the king of their hearts.\n\nJesus did not wish to be made a king like Herod or Caesar.  He was God,\nso He was King of kings already.  He made His disciples go away at once\nin the boat to the other side of the lake, and He sent the crowds away\nHimself.  When Jesus was alone, He went up into a mountain and prayed.\nBut now a great wind began to blow, and the waves on the Sea of Galilee\nbegan to toss about.  The disciples rowed hard, but they could not get\non; the wind kept trying to blow them back.  But Jesus saw them, and\nwhen the night was nearly over, He came to them walking on the sea.\nThe disciples had never seen Him walking on the water before,",
      " and they\ncould not understand who He was, and they cried out for fear.  But\nJesus was sorry for them, and He spoke kindly to them directly and\nsaid, 'BE OF GOOD CHEER (that means, 'Be glad').  IT IS I.  BE NOT\nAFRAID.'\n\nAnd Peter said, 'Lord, if it be Thou, bid me come unto Thee on the\nwater.'  And Jesus said, 'Come.'  And Peter jumped out of the boat, and\nwalked on the water to go to Jesus.  But soon Peter began to think of\nthe rough wind and waves instead of thinking about Jesus, and then he\ncould not get on at all, and he began to sink in the water, and called\nbut, 'Lord, save me!'  And Jesus put out His hand and caught him, and\nsaid, 'O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?'  Then they\nboth came into the boat, and the wind stopped blowing.  And the\ndisciples fell down at the feet of Jesus, and said 'THOU ART THE SON OF\nGOD.'  Then, all at once, they saw that their boat was close to the\nland.",
      "  Jesus had brought it there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMORE WONDERFUL WORKS AND WORDS\n\nAnd now Jesus went right away from the Sea of Galilee again to Caesarea\nPhilippi.  That place was called Caesarea after Augustus Caesar,\nEmperor of Rome, and Philippi after Herod Philip.  When they were going\nto Caesarea Philippi, Jesus talked quietly to His disciples, and said,\n'Whom do you say that I am?'  Peter almost always spoke first, before\nthe others had time to say anything, and he said quickly, 'THOU ART THE\nCHRIST, THE SON OF THE LIVING GOD.'  Jesus was very much pleased with\nthat answer.\n\nThen Jesus called the people who stood near, and His disciples too, and\nHe told them that if they followed Him, they too might have to die for\nHis sake.  But He told them that they must not mind that, because\nheaven is better than this world.  And He told them that if they were\nashamed of Him, He should be ashamed of them before His Father and the\nholy angels.  Dear children, I hope, when you go to school, or are with\nyour little friends,",
      " that you will never be ashamed of Jesus.\n\nAbout a week after that talk with His disciples, Jesus took Peter, and\nJames, and John into a high hill alone to pray.  There is a splendid\nhigh mountain near Caesarea Philippi, called Hermon.  All at once, as\nJesus was praying, the disciples saw that His face shown like the sun,\nand His clothes were white and shining like the light.  And as the\ndisciples looked, they saw two men talking with Jesus, called Moses and\nElijah, two holy men who went to heaven long, long ago.  We do not know\nhow long they talked.  Peter, and James, and John were men, so they\ncould not look very long at those heavenly visitors; soon their eyes\nclosed, and they fell fast asleep.  When they woke up, Moses and Elijah\nwere still there, and when the disciples saw Jesus again, looking so\nbright and beautiful, they were very much afraid.\n\nWhen they came down from the mountain, they saw a crowd down below.\nJesus had left nine of His disciples behind when He went up Mount\nHermon; and now He saw a great number of persons all round them, and\nheard some Jews worrying them with questions.",
      "  When Jesus came near\nenough to speak, He asked what was the matter.  And a man came running\nto Him out of the crowd, and begged Him to look at his boy--his only\nchild.  And he said to Jesus, 'If Thou canst do anything, take pity on\nme, and help me.'  And Jesus made the boy well from that very hour.\nThe disciples had not had faith enough themselves to be able to do that\nsick boy any good.\n\nEvery year the Jews had to pay half a shekel of money for the splendid\nTemple in Jerusalem; and when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the men who\nwere collecting the money came to Peter, and said, 'Does not your\nMaster pay the half-shekel?'  And Peter said, 'Yes.'  Now the Temple\nwas God's house, and Jesus was God's Son.  And Jesus explained to Peter\nwhen he came into the house that kings did not expect their own sons to\npay them taxes.  But it was not wrong to pay the half-shekel, and Jesus\nnever vexed people if He could possibly help it, so He said to Peter,\n'Go thou to the sea and cast a hook,",
      " and take up the fish that first\ncometh up, and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a piece\nof money.  That take, and give unto them for Me and thee.'\n\nAnd now, after a long time, Jesus and His disciples went up to\nJerusalem again; and as they walked along, they saw ten lepers standing\na long way off.  As Jesus came near, they cried out, 'Jesus, Master,\nhave mercy on us.'  Nine of the lepers were Jews, and one was a\nSamaritan.  And Jesus was sorry for them all, and said, 'Go, show\nyourselves to the priests.'  So they turned straight round to go to the\npriests, and lo! as they were going along the road, they suddenly felt\nthat they were strong and well again.  When the Samaritan felt in\nhimself that the leprosy had gone away, he turned back, and threw\nhimself down at the feet of Jesus, and thanked Him, and thanked God too\nfor all His goodness.  But none of the nine Jews came back to thank\nJesus.\n\nA few days after that a man came to Jesus, and asked how he could get\n",
      "to heaven.  Jesus said that he must love God with all his heart, and\nhis neighbor as himself.  Then the man said, 'Who is my neighbor?'  So\nJesus told him this story, THE GOOD SAMARITAN: 'A certain man went down\nfrom Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him\nof his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.\nAnd by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he\nsaw him, he passed by on the other side.  And likewise a Levite, when\nhe was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other\nside.  But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and\nwhen he saw him, he had compassion on him.  And went to him, and bound\nup his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast,\nand brought him to an inn, and took care of him.  And on the morrow\nwhen he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and\nsaid unto him, 'Take care of him: and whatsoever thou spendest more,\nwhen I come again,",
      " I will repay thee.'  When Jesus had finished that\nstory, He said, 'Which now of these three was neighbor unto him that\nfell among the thieves?'  You can answer that question, and can go and\ndo like that good Samaritan.\n\n[Illustration: The good Samaritan.]\n\nJust opposite the Temple hill, Mount Moriah, there was another hill,\ncalled the Mount of Olives.  On the other side of the Mount of Olives\nwas a village, called Bethany, and Jesus often walked over the hill to\nsee some friends of His there, a brother and two sisters who lived in\nthe village.  Their names were Mary and Martha and Lazarus.  Jesus\nloved them very much, and they loved Him.  But Mary and Martha showed\ntheir love in very different ways.  Mary sat as quiet and still as\npossible when Jesus came in, and listened to every word that He said;\nand Martha wanted so much to make Him happy and comfortable that she\nran about the whole time doing things for Him, instead of listening to\nthe beautiful words He was saying.\n\n[Illustration: Bethany.]\n\nJesus likes you and me to work for Him; but He likes us to talk to Him\n",
      "in prayer too, and to listen to the things that He whispers in our\nhearts, and to the words that He says to us in the Bible.\n\n[Illustration: Child at prayer.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE MAN BORN BLIND, AND LAZARUS.\n\nOne Sabbath day, most likely the next Sabbath day after the Feast of\nTabernacles, Jesus saw a blind beggar out of doors.  That poor man had\nalways been blind.  He had never been able to see at all.  Jesus spat\non the ground, and put the wet earth on the blind man's eyes, and said,\n'Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.'  And the man went and washed, and\ncame back able to see.  The people who met him began to ask him, 'How\nwere thine eyes opened?'  And the man told them.  Then they wanted to\nknow where Jesus was.  But the man did not know that.  Then the people\nbrought him to the Pharisees to see what they would say.  And the\nPharisees said, 'How is it that you can see now?'  And the man told\nthem.\n\nThen the Pharisees turned him out of the synagogue.",
      "  Jesus heard about\nthat, and He came to the lonely man, and said, 'Dost thou believe on\nthe Son of God?'  And the man said, 'Who is He, Lord, that I might\nbelieve 'on Him?'  And Jesus said to him, 'THOU HAST BOTH SEEN HIM, AND\nHE IT IS THAT TALKETH WITH THEE.'  Then the man fell down at the feet\nof Jesus, saying, 'Lord, I believe.'\n\nAnd now Jesus turned to the Pharisees, and told them that _they_ were\nvery blind.  They could see things with their eyes, but they could not\nsee that their hearts were full of sin.  Then Jesus preached one of the\nmost beautiful of all His sermons.  In it He said, 'I am the Door of\nthe sheep; by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved.  I am the Good\nShepherd; the Good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep.  I am the\nGood Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine; and I lay down\nMy life for the sheep, And other sheep I have which are not of this\nfold;",
      " them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there\nshall be one flock under one Shepherd.'\n\n[Illustration: The shepherd's care (2nd version).]\n\nThe 'other sheep' Jesus spoke about meant the Gentiles, the people who\nare not Jews.  It meant you and me, and it meant all the heathen.  He\nhas called us.  He is calling the heathen.  And many sheep, many quiet\nlittle lambs, have heard the voice of Jesus, and are following Him.\nHave you heard Him calling you?  Have you followed Him? if not, oh,\nmake haste to go after Him now.\n\nSoon after Jesus had gone away from Bethany, His friend Lazarus became\nvery ill.  Martha and Mary longed for Jesus now, and they thought, 'If\nJesus were here, our brother would not die;' and they sent a messenger\nto Him to say 'Lord, he whom Thou lovest is sick.'  When Jesus heard\nthat, He stayed on quietly where He was for two days longer.  Then He\ncame to Bethany, and by this time Lazarus had been in the grave for\nfour days.  Presently somebody came to Martha,",
      " and said to her quietly,\n'Jesus is coming.'  When Martha heard that, she got up, and went out to\nmeet Him.  And when she saw Jesus, she said, 'Lord, if Thou hadst been\nhere, my brother would not have died; but I know that even now whatever\nThou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.'  Jesus said to her, 'Thy\nbrother shall rise again.'  When Jesus saw how unhappy Mary and Martha\nwere, He too felt very sad, and said, 'Where have ye laid him?'  And\nthey said, 'Lord, come and see.' And then----Jesus wept.  'See how He\nloved Lazarus,' said the Jews; and they wondered that Jesus had let His\nfriend die.\n\nNow they had come to the grave.  It was a hole in the side of a rock,\nand there was a heavy stone over it.  Jesus said, 'Take ye away the\nstone;' and they rolled it away.  Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and\nthanked God that He had heard His prayer and given Him back the life of\nLazarus.  And then He cried with a loud voice,",
      " 'Lazarus, come forth.'\nAnd the man who had been dead came out of the cave alive.  When the\nJews saw what was done, some of them believed, but others hurried off\nto Jerusalem to make mischief as fast as they could.\n\nAfter a time Jesus crossed the Jordan and again came into Perea, and\nthen He came slowly down through Perea to Jerusalem.\n\n[Illustration: The shepherd's care (3rd version).]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE PRODIGAL SON, AND OTHER STORIES.\n\nOne day, when the mothers of Perea brought their little ones to Jesus,\nthe disciples found fault with them for coming, and tried to keep them\naway.  But when Jesus saw what the disciples were doing He was much\ndispleased, and said to them--\n\n'SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN, AND FORBID THEM NOT, TO COME UNTO ME: FOR OF\nSUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.'\n\nAnd He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed\nthem.\n\nJesus used to tell some very beautiful stories as He went slowly\nthrough the Holy Land.  We have not room for all, but I must tell you\ntwo or three,",
      " and I will tell you them exactly as Jesus first told them.\n\n'A certain man had two sons: and the younger of them said to his\nfather, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me.  And\nhe divided unto them his living.\n\n'And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and\ntook his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance\nwith riotous living.\n\n'And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land;\nand he began to be in want.  And he went and joined himself to a\ncitizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.\nAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine\ndid eat: and no man gave unto him.  And when he came to himself, he\nsaid, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to\nspare, and I perish with hunger!  I will arise and go to my father, and\nwill say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before\nthee, and am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy\nhired servants.\n\n'",
      "And he arose and came to his father.  But when he was yet a great way\noff, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran and fell on his\nneck, and kissed him.\n\n'And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and\nin thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.\n\n'But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and\nput it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and\nbring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be\nmerry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and\nis found.'\n\nTHE STORY OF THE UNMERCIFUL SERVANT.\n\nAt another time Jesus said--\n\n'Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which\nwould take account of his servants.  And when he had begun to reckon,\none was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.  But\nforasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and\nhis wife, and children, and all that he had,",
      " and payment to be made.\n\n'The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord,\nhave patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n\n'Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed\nhim, and forgave him the debt.\n\n'But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants,\nwhich owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him\nby the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.\n\n'And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying,\nHave patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n\n'And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should\npay the debt.\n\n[Illustration: The Jordan near Bethabara.]\n\n'So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry,\nand came and told unto their lord all that was done.  Then his lord,\nafter that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I\nforgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me: shouldest not\nthou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity\n",
      "on thee?  And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,\ntill he should pay all that was due unto him.\n\n'So likewise shall my Heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your\nhearts forgive not every one his brother.'\n\nJesus often told beautiful parables: here are two--\n\nTHE STORY OF THE TARES.\n\n'The kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in\nhis field: but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among\nthe wheat, and went his way.\n\n'But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then\nappeared the tares also.\n\n'So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst\nnot thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?\n\n'He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.\n\n'The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them\nup?'\n\n'But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also\nthe wheat with them.  Let both grow together until the harvest: and in\nthe time of harvest I will say to the reapers,",
      " Gather ye together first\nthe tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat\ninto my barn.'\n\nTHE STORY OF THE TEN VIRGINS.\n\n'Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which\ntook their lamps, and went forth to meet the bride-groom.\n\n'And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.  They that were\nfoolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them: but the wise took\noil in their vessels with their lamps.\n\n'While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.\n\n'And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh;\ngo ye out to meet him.\n\n'Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.  And the\nfoolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone\nout.\n\n'But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us\nand you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.\n\n'And while they went to buy, the bride-groom came; and they that were\nready went in with him to the marriage:",
      " and the door was shut.\n\n'Afterwards came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.\n\n'But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.\nWatch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the\nSon of Man cometh.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE LAST DAYS IN JERUSALEM.\n\nWhen it was time for Him to end His work on earth, Jesus started for\nJerusalem.  The people in Jerusalem heard that He was coming, and\ncrowds of them poured out of Jerusalem to meet Him.  They carried\nboughs of palm trees in their hands, and waved them, and cried,\n'HOSANNA!  BLESSED BE THE KING THAT COMETH IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!\nPEACE IN HEAVEN, AND GLORY IN THE HIGHEST.'\n\nPresently Jesus came to a part of the Mount of Olives where He could\nsee Jerusalem and the Temple straight before Him; and as He looked at\nthem, He wept aloud.  He wept because they loved their sins, and hated\ntheir Saviour.  He wept because He knew that God would have to punish\nthem.  He knew that in a very few years the Romans would come and fight\n",
      "against Jerusalem, and burn down that Temple, and kill thousands of the\nJews, or carry them away as slaves.  Were not these things enough to\nmake the Lord Jesus weep?\n\n[Illustration: Mount of Olives and Jerusalem.]\n\nThe blind and the lame came to Jesus in the Temple, and He made them\nwell; and when the little children cried, 'HOSANNA TO THE SON OF\nDAVID,' He was pleased to hear their song.  But the priests were very\nangry.  'Hosanna to the Son of David' means 'Save us, Jesus, our King.'\nThe priests could not bear to hear the children call Jesus their King,\nand ask Him to save them.  And Satan is very angry now when He hears a\nlittle child say, 'Save me, O Jesus, my King.'  But Jesus is pleased.\n\nDuring these last days Jesus stayed quietly each night at Bethany; but\nthe priests were very busy thinking how they could take Him prisoner,\nand they were very pleased when Judas came in secretly, and said, 'Give\nme money, and I will give you Jesus.'  And the priests said they would\ngive Judas thirty pieces of silver if he would give Jesus up to them.\nThirty pieces of silver!",
      "  Why, that was only about seventeen dollars\n($17)--only as much as used to be paid for a slave.\n\nThe next day while Jesus stayed quietly in Bethany, Peter and John were\nvery busy, for Jesus had sent them to Jerusalem to get ready for the\nPassover.  They had to take a lamb to the Temple to be killed by the\npriests, and they had to find a house in which to eat the Passover\nsupper.\n\nOnce every year the Jews used to kill a lamb, and pour out its blood\nbefore God, to show that they remembered God's goodness to them when\nthey were in Egypt, in letting his angel pass over their houses.  And\nthen they roasted the lamb, and met together in their houses to eat it,\nand to thank God for all his love and kindness.\n\nWhen Peter and John had got the Passover supper quite ready, Jesus came\nfrom Bethany with the rest of His disciples, and they all sat down\ntogether at the table; and Jesus told the disciples that He was very\nglad to eat this Passover with them, because it was the very last time\nHe would eat and drink at all before He died.  Then Jesus took off His\n",
      "long, loose outside dress, and He wrapt a towel round Him, and poured\nwater into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe\nthem with the long towel which He had fastened round His waist.\n\nWhen Jesus had finished washing His disciples' feet, He put on His long\ncoat again (it was called an _abba_), and sat down.  And He told His\ndisciples that He had given them an example, so that they might be kind\nto one another, and wait upon one another.\n\nJesus said many beautiful words to His disciples that night at the\nsupper; and when the supper was finished, they went out into the Mount\nof Olives, to a place called Gethsemane, a garden full of olive trees,\nwhere Jesus often went to pray.\n\nWhen Jesus came to Gethsemane with His disciples, He told them to sit\ndown and wait for Him while He went on farther to pray.  But He took\nwith Him Peter and James and John.  As they walked on, Jesus began to\nbe so very sorrowful that He wanted to be quite alone with God.  So He\ntold Peter and James and John to stay behind and to watch.",
      "  But they\nwent to sleep.  And then Jesus went a little way off, and fell down on\nHis knees and prayed.  And now His mind was in such pain that He\nsuffered agony, and the sweat rolled down His face in drops of blood.\nThen Jesus came to Peter and James and John, and found them fast\nasleep.  Twice Jesus went away and prayed the same prayer, and twice He\ncame back to find His disciples asleep.\n\n[Illustration: Gethsemane.]\n\nAnd now a great crowd poured into the garden.  Judas was walking first,\nto show the others the way, and he came up to Jesus and kissed Him\nagain and again, and said, 'Master!  Master!  Peace!'  And when the\npeople saw Judas do that, they took hold of Jesus and held Him fast.\nThey took Jesus first to the house of a priest called Annas, and then\nto the palace of Caiaphas the high priest; and John, who knew somebody\nin that house, was allowed to come in.  Peter was left outside; but\nsoon John asked the girl at the door to let Peter in too.  Peter was\nglad to come in to see what was being done to his dear Master.\n\nThe houses in the East are built round a great square court,",
      " like a big\nhall, only it has no roof.  It was the middle of the night, and the\ncold air blew into that court.  But the servants had made a great fire\nof coals in the middle of the court, and while Jesus was standing\nbefore Caiaphas and the other priests, the servants sat round that fire\nwaiting, and warming themselves.  Peter came and sat down with the\nservants, and warmed himself too.\n\nPresently the girl who attended to the door came up to the fire, and\nshe had a good look at Peter, and said, 'And you were with Jesus of\nNazareth.  Are you not one of His disciples?'  Then Peter told a lie\nbefore all the servants, and said, 'Woman, I am not.  I do not know\nHim, and I do not know what you mean.'  And he went on warming himself,\nand tried to look as though he knew nothing in the world about Jesus.\nBut Peter loved Jesus too much to be able to do this well.  He was\nunhappy, he could not sit still; he got up, and went away into a place\nnear the door, called the porch, and when he was in the porch he heard\n",
      "a cock crow.  Perhaps he went into the porch because he thought that it\nwould be dark there and that nobody would see him.  But the girl who\nkept the door told another woman to look at him, and that woman said to\nthe people who stood by, 'This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth, and\nis one of His disciples.'  Then a man who stood there said to Peter,\n'Are you not one of His disciples?'  And again Peter told a lie, and\nsaid, 'Man, I am not.  I do not know the Man.'\n\nAn hour passed by, and then some of the people near said, 'You must be\none of the disciples of Jesus.  The way that you speak shows that you\ncome from Galilee.'  While Peter was again denying him, Jesus turned\nround, and looked upon Peter.  And Peter remembered what Jesus had said\nto him, 'Before the cock crow twice, you will say three times you do\nnot know Me.'  And when he thought about what he had done, he was very,\nvery sorry; and he went out of the high priest's palace, and wept\nbitterly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE CRUCIFIXION AND THE RESURRECTION\n\nWhen the morning came,",
      " the priests met once more with all the chief\nJews, and said Jesus must die.  But the Jews could not put anyone to\ndeath.  The Romans would not allow it.  So they took Jesus to the Roman\ngovernor, whose name was Pontius Pilate.\n\nWhen Judas saw that the priests had made up their minds to kill Jesus,\nhe began to feel very unhappy.  He did not care for the money now.  He\ncame to the Temple, and brought it back to the priest, and said, 'It\nwas very wrong of me to give Jesus up to you.  He had done nothing\nwrong.'  But their hearts were as hard as stone.  They said to Judas,\n'What is that to us?  See thou to that.'  Then Judas had no hope left.\nHe flung the thirty pieces of silver down in the Court of the Priests,\nand went and hung himself.  But oh! what a pity that he did not go to\nJesus and ask Jesus to forgive him, instead of going to the priests!\nJesus is a good, kind, loving Master.  When we do wrong, if we are very\nsorry, like Peter, and will come and ask Jesus,",
      " He will forgive us.  For\n\n'THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST, GOD'S SON, CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN.'\n\nPilate took Jesus inside his splendid palace, away from the Jews, and\nasked Him, 'Art thou a King then?'\n\n'Yes,' Jesus said, 'but My kingdom is not of this world.  I came into\nthis world to teach people the truth.  That is the reason I was born.'\n\n'What is truth?' said Pilate.  But he did not wait for an answer.  He\nwent out again to the Jews.\n\nWhen the Jews saw Pilate again, they began to tell him lies which they\nhad been making up about Jesus.  And Jesus stood by and said nothing.\nPresently Pilate said to Jesus, 'See what a number of things they are\nsaying against you.  Have you nothing to say?'\n\nBut Jesus did not answer one single word, and Pilate was greatly\nsurprised.  He felt sure that the quiet prisoner was right and that the\nJews were wrong; and he said to the priests and to the people, 'I find\nin Him no fault at all.'\n\nIt was the custom for Pilate at Passover time to set free from prison\n",
      "any one prisoner the people liked to ask for.  So Pilate said to the\ncrowd, 'Shall I let Jesus go?'  Then the priests told the people what\nto say, and they shouted, 'Not this man, but Barabbas.'\n\nPilate wanted very much to let Jesus go, and he said, 'What shall I do\nthen with Jesus?'\n\nThe crowd shouted, 'Let Him be crucified!  Crucify Him!  Crucify Him!'\n\n'Why,' said Pilate, 'what has He done wrong?  He does not deserve to\ndie.  I will scourge Him and let Him go.'\n\nThen the people cried out more loudly than ever, 'Let Him be crucified!\nCrucify Him!'\n\nBut Pilate did not want to be shouted at for five or six days and\nnights again.  And, besides, he rather wanted to please the Jews if he\ncould, because he had done many things to vex them; so he thought, 'I\nwill do what they wish.'  But first he had a basin of water brought,\nand he washed his hands before all the people, and said, 'I have\nnothing to do with the blood of this good Man.",
      "  See ye to it.'  And all\nthe people answered and said, 'His blood be on us, and on our\nchildren.'  Sometimes now, when we don't want to have anything to do\nwith a thing, we say, 'I wash my hands of it.'  But Pilate did have\nsomething to do with the death of Jesus, and water would not wash away\nthat sin.\n\nAnd at last, wishing to please them, Pilate had Barabbas brought out of\nprison, and gave Jesus up to be beaten.  The Roman soldiers seized\nJesus, and took off His clothes and put a scarlet dress on Him, to\nimitate the Emperor's purple robe; and they twisted pieces of a thorny\nplant which grows round Jerusalem into the shape of a crown, and put it\non His head; and they put a reed in His hand for a sceptre.  And then\nall the soldiers fell down before Jesus, and said, 'Hail, King of the\nJews.'  And then they spit at Jesus, and slapped Him; and they snatched\nthe reed out of His hands and struck Him on the head, so as to drive in\nthe thorns.\n\nOutside the city gate,",
      " on the north side of Jerusalem, there is a round\nhill, called the Place of Stoning.  On one side of that hill there is a\nstraight yellow cliff, and prisoners used sometimes to be thrown down\nfrom that cliff, and then stoned.  And sometimes they were taken to the\ntop of that round hill and crucified.  It is very likely that this is\nwhere the soldiers took Jesus.  That hill is often called Calvary.\n\nThe soldiers made Jesus lie down on the cross, and they nailed Him to\nit--putting nails through His hands and His feet.  Then they lifted up\nthe cross with Jesus on it, and fixed it in a hole in the ground.  And\nJesus said,\n\n'FATHER, FORGIVE THEM; FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO.'\n\nThen the soldiers crucified two thieves, and put them near Jesus, one\non each side; and they nailed up some white boards at the top of the\ncrosses with black letters on them, to say what the prisoners had done.\nThey put over Jesus Christ's head the words--\n\n'THIS IS JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.'\n\nThree hours of fearful pain passed away.",
      "  It was twelve o'clock.  And\nnow it became quite dark and it was dark till three o'clock in the\nafternoon.  That was a dreadful three hours more for Jesus.  It was a\ntime of agony of mind, like the time He spent in the Garden of\nGethsemane.  He was having His last fight with Satan, and He felt quite\nalone.  When it was about three o'clock, Jesus cried out with a loud\nvoice, 'It is finished.'  And He cried again with a loud voice, and\nsaid, 'Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit.'  And He bowed His\nhead and died.\n\n[Illustration: Calvary.]\n\nAnd now wonderful things happened.  The ground shook; the graves\nopened; dead people woke up to life again; and a great veil, or\ncurtain, which hung before the most holy part of the Temple, was\nsuddenly torn into two pieces.  The high priest used to go once a year\ninto that Most Holy Place to offer sacrifice for sin before God.  But\nwhen the great purple and gold curtain was torn down without hands, it\nwas just as if a voice from heaven had said,",
      " 'No more blood of lambs,\nno more high priest is wanted now.  Jesus, the real Passover Lamb, has\nbeen sacrificed.  Jesus has offered His own blood before God for\nsinners, and God will forgive every sinner who trusts in the blood of\nJesus.'\n\nThen a rich man, called Joseph, came to Pilate and begged Pilate to let\nhim have the body of Jesus to bury.  Pilate said that Joseph might have\nthe body of his Master.  And Joseph came and took it down from the\ncross; and he and Nicodemus wrapped the body round with clean linen,\nwith a very great quantity of sweet-smelling stuff inside the linen.\n\nThere was a garden close to the place where Jesus was crucified, and in\nthat garden there was a grave which Joseph had cut in a rock.  The\ngrave was not like those which we have.  It was a little room in the\nrock, with a seat on the right hand, and a seat on the left, and with a\nplace in the wall just opposite the door for the body.  Joseph and\nNicodemus laid the body of Jesus in this new grave.  Then they came\nout, and rolled a great round stone over the door,",
      " and went away.\n\nJesus was crucified on Friday, and now it was Sunday.  It was very\nearly in the morning.  The soldiers were watching at the grave of\nJesus, and all was still; when suddenly the earth began to tremble and\nshake.  And behold, an angel came down from heaven, and rolled away the\nstone at the door of the tomb, and the Lord of Life came out.  The\nsoldiers did not see Jesus, but they did see the shining angel.  The\nRoman soldiers shook with fright.  They were so frightened that they\nhad no strength left in them, and as soon as they could they ran away\nfrom the place.\n\nAnd now that the soldiers had gone, some women came near--Mary\nMagdalene, Mary the mother of James, Joanna, Salome, and at least one\nor two more women.  They had brought with them some sweet-smelling\nspices, which they had made or bought, to put round the body of Jesus.\nThe light was beginning to come in the sky, to show that the sun would\nbe up soon, but it was still rather dark.  As the women came along,\nthey said one to the other, 'Who will roll away the stone for us from\n",
      "the door of the tomb?'  For it was very great.  Then they looked, and\nbehold! the stone was gone.  And Mary Magdalene ran back to the city,\nto tell Peter and John that the door of the tomb was open.  But the\nother women went on, and went into the tomb where they had seen Jesus\nlaid.  He was not there now, but an angel in a long white robe was\nsitting on the right-hand side of the tomb.  Then the women saw two\nangels standing by them in shining clothes, and they were afraid, and\nfell on their faces to the ground.  Then one of the angels said to\nthem, 'Fear not.  He is not here; He is risen.'\n\n[Illustration: The empty tomb.]\n\nBut Mary Magdalene after all had been the first to see Jesus.  She had\nrun off to tell Peter and John that the stone was rolled away.  As soon\nas Peter and John knew that, they ran off to the grave as fast as they\ncould, and Mary Magdalene went after them.  John could run the fastest,\nso he got there first, and just peeped in through the little door in\n",
      "the rock.  The angels had gone away, but he could see the linen\nbandages.  They were not thrown about here and there, but they were\nlying neatly together.  But when Peter came up he wanted to see more\nthan that, and he went straight into the tomb, and John followed him.\nWhen Peter and John saw that the body of Jesus had really gone, they\nwent away back to the city and told the other disciples.\n\nBut Mary Magdalene did not go back.  As she turned away from the grave\nshe saw that somebody was standing near the grave.  It was really\nJesus, but she did not know that.  She was too sad to look up.\n\nAnd Jesus said to her, 'Woman, why weepest thou?  Whom seekest thou?'\n\nMary thought, 'It is the gardener,' and she said, 'Sir, if you have\ncarried Him away, tell me where you have laid Him, and I will take Him\naway.'\n\nThen Jesus said, 'Mary.'  And Mary turned round quickly, and said,\n'Master.'  Then she saw that it was Jesus, and He sent her with a\nmessage to His disciples.  So Mary hurried back again into the city\n",
      "with her good news.  She found the disciples, and when she said, 'I\nhave seen the Lord,' they would not believe it.  And when some other\nwomen who had met Jesus a little later came in, and said, 'We have seen\nthe Lord,' it was just the same.  The disciples only thought, 'What\nnonsense these women talk!'  Before the women came in, two of the\ndisciples had gone for a very long walk.  As they walked along, and\ntalked, Jesus came near, and went with them.\n\nWhile Jesus talked and the disciples listened, they came to the village\nof Emmaus.  That was the end of the disciples' journey, and now Jesus\nbegan to walk on by Himself.  But the disciples begged Him to stay with\nthem, 'Abide with us,' they said; 'it is getting late.  It will soon be\nevening.'  So Jesus went in, and sat down at table with them.  And He\ntook bread in His hands, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to\nthem.  Perhaps Jesus had some special way of saying grace which made\nthe disciples know who He was.  Anyway,",
      " they knew Him now.  And then,\nsuddenly, He was gone.  Cleopas and his friend could not keep their\ngood news to themselves.  They got up at once, and went back, more than\nseven miles, to Jerusalem, and found a number of the Lord's friends and\ndisciples sitting together at supper.  Some of them were saying, 'THE\nLORD IS RISEN INDEED.'\n\nThen Jesus Himself came to them, and He told them that it was very\nwrong not to believe.  Then, when He saw that they were frightened, He\nsaid, 'Peace be unto you,' and He showed them His hands and His feet,\nand ate some fried fish and honey which they had put on the table for\nsupper.  That was to make them understand that His body was really\nalive as well as His soul.  And now the disciples were filled with\ngladness and Joy.\n\nThen Jesus told them the same things that He had been explaining to\nCleopas and his friend, and He said to them--\n\n'AS MY FATHER HATH SENT ME, EVEN SO SEND I YOU.  GO YE INTO ALL THE\nWORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.'\n\nThat is the great missionary text.",
      "  A missionary means, you remember,\n'one who is sent.'  That text was meant for you and for me, as well as\nfor the first disciples of Jesus.\n\nAfter these things, the eleven disciples went away to Galilee, and\nwaited for Jesus to meet them there.\n\nOne day Thomas and Nathanael, and James and John, and two other\ndisciples, were together by the side of the Sea of Galilee.  Peter was\nthere too, and he always liked to be doing something, so he said to the\nothers, 'I go a-fishing.'  And they said, 'We will also go with you;'\nand at once they all jumped into a little ship, and pushed off into the\nlake.  But that night they caught nothing.\n\n[Illustration: The Sea of Galilee.]\n\nNext morning Jesus came and stood on the shore.  The disciples could\nsee Him, because the little ship was now pretty near to the land, but\nthey did not know Him.  Jesus said to the men in the boat, 'Children,\nhave you anything to eat?'\n\nThey thought, I suppose, that this stranger wanted to buy some fish,\nand they said, 'No.'  Then Jesus said,",
      " 'Cast the net on the right side\nof the ship, and you shall find.'\n\nAnd the disciples did what Jesus had said, and at once the net became\nso heavy with fish that the fishermen could not pull it into the boat.\n\nThen John said to Peter, 'It is the Lord.'\n\nWhen Peter heard that, he jumped into the water, so as to get quicker\nto land.  The other disciples stayed in the boat, and dragged the fish\nalong after them.  When the boat got to land, Peter helped the other\nmen to pull the net in.  It was full of great fishes--a hundred and\nfifty and three.  Jesus had got a fire of coals ready on the beach, and\nsome bread; and some fish were broiling on the fire.  And now Jesus\nsaid to the tired fishermen, 'Come and dine,' and He waited upon them\nHimself.\n\nAfter that day by the Sea of Galilee, the disciples went to a mountain\nwhich Jesus told them about.  And Jesus met them there, and said to\nthem, 'Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  AND LO I AM WITH YOU\n",
      "ALWAY, EVEN UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD.'  There is another splendid\nmissionary text.\n\n[Illustration: The Mount of Olives.]\n\nJesus stayed on earth for forty days, and when the forty days were\nover, He went for a last walk with His disciples.  He took them the way\nthey had so often gone together--over the Mount of Olives, and so far\nas Bethany.  There He stopped, and lifted up His hands, and blessed\nthem.  And it came to pass, that while He blessed them, He was taken\nfrom them, and carried up into heaven, and sat down on the right hand\nof God.  As the disciples looked up earnestly towards heaven after\nJesus, two angels in white robes came and stood by them, and said, 'YE\nMEN OF GALILEE, WHY DO YOU STAND LOOKING INTO HEAVEN?  THIS SAME JESUS\nWHICH IS TAKEN UP FROM YOU INTO HEAVEN SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE SAME WAY\nAS YOU HAVE SEEN HIM GO INTO HEAVEN.'\n\nYes, dear children, Jesus is coming again some day.  He will not come\nas a little baby next time.",

He was born at Burgos about the year 1040.\n\nThere is so much of the mythical in the history of this personage that\nhypercritical writers, such as Masdeu, have doubted his existence; but\nrecent researches have succeeded in separating the historical from the\nromantic.\n\nUnder Sancho II, son of Ferdinand, he served as commander of the royal\ntroops. In a war between the two brothers, Sancho II. and Alfonso VI. of\nLeon, due to some dishonorable stratagem on the part of Rodrigo, Sancho\nwas victorious and his brother was forced to seek refuge with the\nMoorish King of Toledo.\n\nIn 1072 Sancho was assassinated at the siege of Zamora, and as he left\nno heir the Castilians had to acknowledge Alfonso as King. Although\nAlfonso never forgave the Cid for having, as leader of the Castilians,\ncompelled him to swear that he (the Cid) had no hand in the murder of\nhis brother Sancho, as a conciliatory measure, he gave his cousin\nXimena, daughter of the Count of Oviedo, to the Cid in marriage, but\nafterwards, in 1081, when he found himself firmly seated on the throne,\nyielding to his own feelings of resentment and incited by the Leonese\nnobles, he banished him from the kingdom.\n\nAt the head of a large body of followers, the Cid joined the Moorish\nKing of Saragossa, in whose service he fought against both Moslems and\nChristians. It was probably during this exile that he was first called\nthe Cid, an Arabic title, which means the _lord_. He was very\nsuccessful in all his battles.\n\nIn conjunction with Mostain, grandson of Moctadir, he invaded Valencia\nin 1088, but afterwards carried on operations alone, and finally, after\na long siege, made himself master of the city in June, 1094. He retained\npossession of Valencia for five years and reigned like an independent\nsovereign over one of the richest territories in the Peninsula, but died\nsuddenly in 1099 of anger and grief on hearing that his relative, Alvar\nFa\u00c3\u00b1ez, had been vanquished and the army which he had sent to his\nassistance had been defeated.\n\nAfter the Cid's death his wife held Valencia till 1102, when she was\nobliged to yield to the Almoravides and fly to Castile, where she died\nin 1104. Her remains were placed by those of her lord in the monastery\nof San Pedro de Carde\u00c3\u00b1a.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CID.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE FIRST.\n\n\nScene I.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira, have you given me a really true report? Do you\nconceal nothing that my father has said?\n\n_Elvira._ All my feelings within me are still delighted with it. He\nesteems Rodrigo as much as you love him; and if I do not misread his\nmind, he will command you to respond to his passion.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Tell me then, I beseech you, a second time, what makes you\nbelieve that he approves of my choice; tell me anew what hope I ought to\nentertain from it. A discourse so charming cannot be too often heard;\nyou cannot too forcibly promise to the fervor of our love the sweet\nliberty of manifesting itself to the light of day. What answer has he\ngiven regarding the secret suit which Don Sancho and Don Rodrigo are\npaying to you? Have you not too clearly shown the disparity between the\ntwo lovers which inclines me to the one side?\n\n_Elvira._ No; I have depicted your heart as filled with an\nindifference which elates not either of them nor destroys hope, and,\nwithout regarding them with too stern or too gentle an aspect, awaits the\ncommands of a father to choose a spouse. This respect has delighted\nhim--his lips and his countenance gave me at once a worthy testimony of\nit; and, since I must again tell you the tale, this is what he hastened\nto say to me of them and of you: 'She is in the right. Both are worthy\nof her; both are sprung from a noble, valiant, and faithful lineage;\nyoung but yet who show by their mien [_lit._ cause to easily be read\nin their eyes] the brilliant valor of their brave ancestors. Don Rodrigo,\nabove all, has no feature in his face which is not the noble [_lit._\nhigh] representative of a man of courage [_lit._ heart], and descends\nfrom a house so prolific in warriors, that they enter into life [_lit._\ntake birth there] in the midst of laurels. The valor of his father, in\nhis time without an equal, as long as his strength endured, was\nconsidered a marvel; the furrows on his brow bear witness to [_lit._\nhave engraved his] exploits, and tell us still what he formerly was. I\npredict of the son what I have seen of the father, and my daughter, in\none word, may love him and please me.' He was going to the council, the\nhour for which approaching, cut short this discourse, which he had\nscarcely commenced; but from these few words, I believe that his mind\n[_lit._ thoughts] is not quite decided between your two lovers. The king\nis going to appoint an instructor for his son, and it is he for whom an\nhonor so great is designed. This choice is not doubtful, and his\nunexampled valor cannot tolerate that we should fear any competition. As\nhis high exploits render him without an equal, in a hope so justifiable\nhe will be without a rival; and since Don Rodrigo has persuaded his\nfather, when going out from the council, to propose the affair. I leave\nyou to judge whether he will seize this opportunity [_lit._ whether he\nwill take his time well], and whether all your desires will soon be\ngratified.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It seems, however, that my agitated soul refuses this joy,\nand finds itself overwhelmed by it. One moment gives to fate different\naspects, and in this great happiness I fear a great reverse.\n\n_Elvira._ You see this fear happily deceived.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Let us go, whatever it may be, to await the issue.\n\n\nScene II.--The INFANTA, LEONORA, and a PAGE.\n\n\n_Infanta (to Page_). Page, go, tell Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne from me, that to-day she is\nrather long in coming to see me, and that my friendship complains of her\ntardiness. [_Exit Page._]\n\n_Leonora._ Dear lady, each day the same desire urges you, and at your\ninterview with her, I see you every day ask her how her love proceeds.\n\n_Infanta._ It is not without reason. I have almost compelled her to\nreceive the arrows with which her soul is wounded. She loves Rodrigo,\nand she holds him from my hand; and by means of me Don Rodrigo has\nconquered her disdain. Thus, having forged the chains of these lovers, I\nought to take an interest in seeing their troubles at an end.\n\n_Leonora._ Dear lady, however, amidst their good fortune you exhibit a\ngrief which proceeds to excess. Does this love, which fills them both\nwith gladness, produce in this noble heart [of yours] profound sadness?\nAnd does this great interest which you take in them render you unhappy,\nwhilst they are happy? But I proceed too far, and become indiscreet.\n\n_Infanta._ My sadness redoubles in keeping the secret. Listen, listen\nat length, how I have struggled; listen what assaults my constancy\n[_lit._ virtue or valor] yet braves. Love is a tyrant which spares no\none. This young cavalier, this lover which I give [her]--I love him.\n\n_Leonora._ You love him!\n\n_Infanta._ Place your hand upon my heart, and feel [_lit._ see] how it\nthrobs at the name of its conqueror! how it recognizes him!\n\n_Leonora._ Pardon me, dear lady, if I am wanting in respect in blaming\nthis passion; a noble princess to so far forget herself as to admit in\nher heart a simple [_or_, humble] cavalier! And what would the King\nsay?--what would Castile say? Do you still remember of whom you are the\ndaughter?\n\n_Infanta._ I remember it so well, that I would shed my blood rather than\ndegrade my rank. I might assuredly answer to thee, that, in noble souls,\nworth alone ought to arouse passions; and, if my love sought to excuse\nitself, a thousand famous examples might sanction it. But I will not\nfollow these--where my honor is concerned, the captivation of my\nfeelings does not abate my courage, and I say to myself always, that,\nbeing the daughter of a king, all other than a monarch is unworthy of\nme. When I saw that my heart could not protect itself, I myself gave\naway that which I did not dare to take; and I put, in place of my self,\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne in its fetters, and I kindled their passions [_lit._ fires] in\norder to extinguish my own. Be then no longer surprised if my troubled\nsoul with impatience awaits their bridal; thou seest that my happiness\n[_lit._ repose] this day depends upon it. If love lives by hope, it\nperishes with it; it is a fire which becomes extinguished for want of\nfuel; and, in spite of the severity of my sad lot, if Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne ever has\nRodrigo for a husband, my hope is dead and my spirit, is healed.\nMeanwhile, I endure an incredible torture; even up to this bridal.\nRodrigo is dear to me; I strive to lose him, and I lose him with regret,\nand hence my secret anxiety derives its origin. I see with sorrow that\nlove compels me to utter sighs for that [object] which [as a princess] I\nmust disdain. I feel my spirit divided into two portions; if my courage\nis high, my heart is inflamed [with love]. This bridal is fatal to me, I\nfear it, and [yet] I desire it; I dare to hope from it only an\nincomplete joy; my honor and my love have for me such attractions, that\nI [shall] die whether it be accomplished, or whether it be not\naccomplished.\n\n_Leonora._ Dear lady, after that I have nothing more to say, except\nthat, with you, I sigh for your misfortunes; I blamed you a short time\nsince, now I pity you. But since in a misfortune [i.e. an ill-timed\nlove] so sweet and so painful, your noble spirit [_lit._ virtue]\ncontends against both its charm and its strength, and repulses its\nassault and regrets its allurements, it will restore calmness to your\nagitated feelings. Hope then every [good result] from it, and from the\nassistance of time; hope everything from heaven; it is too just [_lit._\nit has too much justice] to leave virtue in such a long continued\ntorture.\n\n_Infanta._ My sweetest hope is to lose hope.\n\n(_The Page re-enters._)\n\n_Page._ By your commands, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne comes to see you.\n\n_Infanta_ (to _Leonora_). Go and converse with her in that gallery\n[yonder].\n\n_Leonora._ Do you wish to continue in dreamland?\n\n_Infanta._ No, I wish, only, in spite of my grief, to compose myself\n[_lit._ to put my features a little more at leisure]. I follow you.\n\n[_Leonora goes out along with the Page._]\n\n\nScene III.--The INFANTA (alone).\n\n\nJust heaven, from which I await my relief, put, at last, some limit to\nthe misfortune which is overcoming [_lit._ possesses] me; secure my\nrepose, secure my honor. In the happiness of others I seek my own. This\nbridal is equally important to three [parties]; render its completion\nmore prompt, or my soul more enduring. To unite these two lovers with a\nmarriage-tie is to break all my chains and to end all my sorrows. But I\ntarry a little too long; let us go to meet Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and, by\nconversation, to relieve our grief.\n\n\nScene IV.--COUNT DE GORMAS and DON DIEGO (meeting).\n\n\n_Count._ At last you have gained it [_or_, prevailed], and the favor of\na King raises you to a rank which was due only to myself; he makes you\nGovernor of the Prince of Castile.\n\n_Don Diego._ This mark of distinction with which he distinguishes\n[_lit._ which he puts into] my family shows to all that he is just, and\ncauses it to be sufficiently understood, that he knows how to recompense\nbygone services.\n\n_Count._ However great kings may be, they are only men [_lit._ they are\nthat which we are]; they can make mistakes like other men, and this\nchoice serves as a proof to all courtiers that they know how to [_or_,\ncan] badly recompense present services.\n\n_Don Diego._ Let us speak no more of a choice at which your mind\nbecomes exasperated. Favor may have been able to do as much as merit;\nbut we owe this respect to absolute power, to question nothing when a\nking has wished it. To the honor which he has done me add another--let\nus join by a sacred tie my house to yours. You have an only daughter,\nand I have an only son; their marriage may render us for ever more than\nfriends. Grant us this favor, and accept, him as a son-in-law.\n\n_Count._ To higher alliances this precious son ought [_or_, is likely]\nto aspire; and the new splendor of your dignity ought to inflate his\nheart with another [higher] vanity. Exercise that [dignity], sir, and\ninstruct the prince. Show him how it is necessary to rule a province: to\nmake the people tremble everywhere under his law; to fill the good with\nlove, and the wicked with terror. Add to these virtues those of a\ncommander: show him how it is necessary to inure himself to fatigue; in\nthe profession of a warrior [_lit._ of Mars] to render himself without\nan equal; to pass entire days and nights on horseback; to sleep\nall-armed: to storm a rampart, and to owe to himself alone the winning\nof a battle. Instruct him by example, and render him perfect, bringing\nyour lessons to his notice by carrying them into effect.\n\n_Don Diego._ To instruct himself by example, in spite of your jealous\nfeelings, he shall read only the history of my life. There, in a long\nsuccession of glorious deeds, he shall see how nations ought to be\nsubdued; to attack a fortress, to marshal an army, and on great exploits\nto build his renown.\n\n_Count._ Living examples have a greater [_lit._ another] power. A\nprince, in a book, learns his duty but badly [_or_, imperfectly]; and\nwhat, after all, has this great number of years done which one of my\ndays cannot equal? If you have been valiant, I am so to-day, and this\narm is the strongest support of the kingdom. Granada and Arragon tremble\nwhen this sword flashes; my name serves as a rampart to all Castile;\nwithout me you would soon pass under other laws, and you would soon have\nyour enemies as [_lit._ for] kings. Each day, each moment, to increase\nmy glory, adds laurels to laurels, victory to victory. The prince, by my\nside, would make the trial of his courage in the wars under the shadow\nof my arm; he would learn to conquer by seeing me do so; and, to prove\nspeedily worthy of his high character, he would see----\n\n_Don Diego._ I know it; you serve the king well. I have seen you fight\nand command under me, when [old] age has caused its freezing currents to\nflow within my nerves [i.e. \"when the frosts of old age had numbed my\nnerves\"--_Jules Bue_], your unexampled [_lit._ rare] valor has worthily\n[_lit._ well] supplied my place; in fine, to spare unnecessary words,\nyou are to-day what I used to be. You see, nevertheless, that in this\nrivalry a monarch places some distinction between us.\n\n_Count._ That prize which I deserved you have carried off.\n\n_Don Diego._ He who has gained that [advantage] over you has deserved it\nbest.\n\n_Count._ He who can use it to the best advantage is the most worthy of\nit.\n\n_Don Diego._ To be refused that prize [_lit._ it] is not a good sign.\n\n_Count._ You have gained it by intrigue, being an old courtier.\n\n_Don Diego._ The brilliancy of my noble deeds was my only recommendation\n[_lit._ support].\n\n_Count._ Let us speak better of it [i.e. more plainly]: the king does\nhonor to your age.\n\n_Don Diego._ The king, when he does it [i.e. that honor], gives it\n[_lit._ measures it] to courage.\n\n_Count._ And for that reason this honor was due only to me [_lit._ my\narm].\n\n_Don Diego._ He who has not been able to obtain it did not deserve it.\n\n_Count._ Did not deserve it? I!\n\n_Don Diego._ You.\n\n_Count._ Thy impudence, rash old man, shall have its recompense. [_He\ngives him a slap on the face._] _Don Diego (drawing his sword [_lit._\nputting the sword in his hand_]). Finish [this outrage], and take my\nlife after such an insult, the first for which my race has ever had\ncause to blush [_lit._ has seen its brow grow red].\n\n_Count._ And what do you think you can do, weak us you are [_lit._ with\nsuch feebleness]?\n\n_Don Diego._ Oh, heaven! my exhausted strength fails me in this\nnecessity!\n\n_Count._ Thy sword is mine; but thou wouldst be too vain if this\ndiscreditable trophy had laden my hand [i.e. if I had carried away a\ntrophy so discreditable]. Farewell--adieu! Cause the prince to read, in\nspite of jealous feelings, for his instruction, the history of thy life.\nThis just punishment of impertinent language will serve as no small\nembellishment for it.\n\n\nScene V.--DON DIEGO.\n\n\nO rage! O despair! O inimical old age! Have I then lived so long only\nfor this disgrace? And have I grown grey in warlike toils, only to see\nin one day so many of my laurels wither? Does my arm [i.e. my valor],\nwhich all Spain admires and looks up to [_lit._ with respect]--[does] my\narm, which has so often saved this empire, and so often strengthened\nanew the throne of its king, now [_lit._ then] betray my cause, and do\nnothing for me? O cruel remembrance of my bygone glory! O work of a\nlifetime [_lit._ so many days] effaced in a day! new dignity fatal to my\nhappiness! lofty precipice from which mine honor falls! must I see the\ncount triumph over your splendor, and die without vengeance, or live in\nshame? Count, be now the instructor of my prince! This high rank becomes\n[_lit._ admits] no man without honor, and thy jealous pride, by this\nfoul [_lit._ remarkable] insult, in spite of the choice of the king, has\ncontrived [_lit._ has known how] to render me unworthy of it. And thou,\nglorious instrument of my exploits, but yet a useless ornament of an\nenfeebled body numbed by age [_lit._ all of ice], thou sword, hitherto\nto be feared, and which in this insult has served me for show, and not\nfor defence, go, abandon henceforth the most dishonored [_lit._ the\nlast] of his race; pass, to avenge me, into better hands!\n\n\nScene VI.--DON DIEGO and DON RODRIGO.\n\n\n_Don Diego._ Rodrigo, hast thou courage [_lit._ a heart]?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Any other than my father would have found that out\ninstantly.\n\n_Don Diego._ Welcome wrath! worthy resentment, most pleasing to my\ngrief! I recognize my blood in this noble rage; my youth revives in this\nardor so prompt. Come, my son, come, my blood, come to retrieve my\nshame--come to avenge me!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Of what?\n\n_Don Diego._ Of an insult so cruel that it deals a deadly stroke\nagainst the honor of us both--of a blow! The insolent [man] would have\nlost his life for it, but my age deceived my noble ambition; and this\nsword, which my arm can no longer wield, I give up to thine, to avenge\nand punish. Go against this presumptuous man, and prove thy valor: it is\nonly in blood that one can wash away such an insult; die or slay.\nMoreover, not to deceive thee, I give thee to fight a formidable\nantagonist [_lit._ a man to be feared], I have seen him entirely covered\nwith blood and dust, carrying everywhere dismay through an entire army.\nI have seen by his valor a hundred squadrons broken; and, to tell thee\nstill something more--more than brave soldier, more than great leader,\nhe is----\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Pray, finish.\n\n_Don Diego._ The father of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ The----\n\n_Don Diego._ Do not reply; I know thy love. But he who lives dishonored\nis unworthy of life; the dearer the offender the greater the offence. In\nshort, thou knowest the insult, and thou holdest [in thy grasp the means\nof] vengeance. I say no more to thee. Avenge me, avenge thyself! Show\nthyself a son worthy of a father such as I [am]. Overwhelmed by\nmisfortunes to which destiny reduces me, I go to deplore them. Go, run,\nfly, and avenge us!\n\n\nScene VII.--DON RODRIGO.\n\n\nPierced even to the depth [_or,_ bottom of the heart] by a blow\nunexpected as well as deadly, pitiable avenger of a just quarrel and\nunfortunate object of an unjust severity, I remain motionless, and my\ndejected soul yields to the blow which is slaying me. So near seeing my\nlove requited! O heaven, the strange pang [_or,_ difficulty]! In this\ninsult my father is the person aggrieved, and the aggressor is the\nfather of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne!\n\nWhat fierce conflicts [of feelings] I experience! My love is engaged\n[_lit._ interests itself] against my own honor. I must avenge a father\nand lose a mistress. The one stimulates my courage, the other restrains\nmy arm. Reduced to the sad choice of either betraying my love or of\nliving as a degraded [man], on both sides my situation is wretched\n[_lit._ evil is infinite]. O heaven, the strange pang [_or,_\ndifficulty]! Must I leave an insult unavenged? Must I punish the father\nof Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne?\n\nFather, mistress, honor, love--noble and severe restraint--a bondage\nstill to be beloved [_lit._ beloved tyranny], all my pleasures are dead,\nor my glory is sullied. The one renders me unhappy; the other unworthy\nof life. Dear and cruel hope of a soul noble but still enamored, worthy\nenemy of my greatest happiness, thou sword which causest my painful\nanxiety, hast thou been given to me to avenge my honor? Hast thou been\ngiven to me to lose Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne?\n\nIt is better to rush [_lit._ run] to death. I owe [a duty] to my\nmistress as well as to my father. I draw, in avenging myself, her hatred\nand her rage; I draw upon myself his [i.e. my father's] contempt by\nnot avenging myself. To my sweetest hope the one [alternative] renders\nme unfaithful, and the other [alternative] renders me unworthy of her.\nMy misfortune increases by seeking a remedy [_lit._ by wishing to cure\nit]. All [supposed reliefs] redoubles my woes. Come then, my soul [or,\nbeloved sword], and, since I must die, let us die, at least, without\noffending Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne!\n\nTo die without obtaining satisfaction! To seek a death so fatal to my\nfame! To endure that Spain should impute to my memory [the fact] of\nhaving badly maintained the honor of my house! To respect a love of\nwhich my distracted soul already sees the certain loss. Let us no more\nlisten to this insidious thought, which serves only to pain me [_or,_\ncontributes only to my painful position]. Come, mine arm [_or,_ sword],\nlet us save honor, at least, since, after all, we must lose Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\nYes, my spirit was deceived. I owe all to my father before my mistress.\n\nWhether I die in the combat or die of sadness, I shall yield up my blood\npure as I have received it. I already accuse myself of too much\nnegligence; let us haste to vengeance; and quite ashamed of having\nwavered so much, let us no more be in painful suspense, since to-day my\nfather has been insulted, even though the offender is the father of\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE SECOND.\n\n\nScene I.--COUNT DE GORMAS and DON ARIAS.\n\n\n_Count._ I acknowledge, between ourselves, [that] my blood, a little too\nwarm, became too excited at an expression, and has carried the matter\ntoo far [_lit._ too high], but, since it is done, the deed is without\nremedy.\n\n_Don Arias._ To the wishes of the King let this proud spirit yield; he\ntakes this much to heart, and his exasperated feelings [_lit._ heart]\nwill act against you with full authority. And, indeed, you have no\navailable defence. The [high] rank of the person offended, the greatness\nof the offence, demand duties and submissions which require more than\nordinary reparation.\n\n_Count._ The King can, at his pleasure, dispose of my life.\n\n_Don Arias._ Your fault is followed by too much excitement. The King\nstill loves you; appease his wrath. He has said, \"I desire it!\"--will\nyou disobey?\n\n_Count._ Sir, to preserve all that esteem which I retain [_or,_ (other\nreading), to preserve my glory and my esteem] to disobey in a slight\ndegree is not so great a crime, and, however great that [offence] may\nbe, my immediate services are more than sufficient to cancel it.\n\n_Don Arias._ Although one perform glorious and important deeds, a King\nis never beholden to his subject. You flatter yourself much, and you\nought to know that he who serves his King well only does his duty. You\nwill ruin yourself, sir, by this confidence.\n\n_Count._ I shall not believe you until I have experience of it [_lit._\nuntil after experience of it].\n\n_Don Arias._ You ought to dread the power of a King.\n\n_Count._ One day alone does not destroy a man such as I. Let all his\ngreatness arm itself for my punishment; all the state shall perish, if I\nmust perish.\n\n_Don Arias._ What! do you fear so little sovereign power----?\n\n_Count._ [The sovereign power] of a sceptre which, without me, would\nfall from his hand. He himself has too much interest in my person, and\nmy head in falling would cause his crown to fall.\n\n_Don Arias._ Permit reason to bring back your senses. Take good advice.\n\n_Count_. The advice [_or,_ counsel] with regard to it is [already]\ntaken.\n\n_Don Arias._ What shall I say, after all? I am obliged to give him an\naccount [of this interview].\n\n_Count._ [Say] that I can never consent to my own dishonor.\n\n_Don Arias._ But think that kings will be absolute.\n\n_Count._ The die is cast, sir. Let us speak of the matter no more.\n\n_Don Arias._ Adieu, then, sir, since in vain I try to persuade you.\nNotwithstanding [_lit._ with] all your laurels, still dread the\nthunderbolt.\n\n_Count._ I shall await it without fear.\n\n_Don Arias._ But not without effect.\n\n_Count._ We shall see by that Don Diego satisfied. [_Exit Don Arias.]\n[Alone]_ He who fears not death fears not threats. I have a heart\nsuperior to the greatest misfortunes [_lit._ above the proudest\nmisfortunes]; and men may reduce me to live without happiness, but they\ncannot compel me to live without honor.\n\n\nScene II.--The COUNT and DON RODRIGO.\n\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Here, count, a word or two.\n\n_Count._ Speak.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Relieve me from a doubt. Dost thou know Don Diego well?\n\n_Count._ Yes.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let us speak [in] low [tones]; listen. Dost thou know\nthat this old man was the very [essence of] virtue, valor, and honor in\nhis time? Dost thou know it?\n\n_Count._ Perhaps so.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ This fire which I carry in mine eyes, knowest thou that\nthis is his blood? Dost thou know it?\n\n_Count._ What matters it to me?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Four paces hence I shall cause thee to know it.\n\n_Count._ Presumptuous youth!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Speak without exciting thyself. I am young, it is true;\nbut in souls nobly born valor does not depend upon age [_lit._ wait for\nthe number of years].\n\n_Count._ To measure thyself with me! Who [_or_, what] has rendered thee\nso presumptuous--thou, whom men have never seen with a sword [_lit._\narms] in thine hand?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Men like me do not cause themselves to be known at a\nsecond trial, and they wish [to perform] masterly strokes for their\nfirst attempt.\n\n_Count._ Dost thou know well who I am?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Yes! Any other man except myself, at the mere mention of\nthy name, might tremble with terror. The laurels with which I see thine\nhead so covered seem to bear written [upon them] the prediction of my\nfall. I attack, like a rash man, an arm always victorious; but by\ncourage I shall overcome you [_lit._ I shall have too much strength in\npossessing sufficient courage]. To him who avenges his father nothing is\nimpossible. Thine arm is unconquered, but not invincible.\n\n_Count._ This noble courage which appears in the language you hold has\nshown itself each day by your eyes; and, believing that I saw in you the\nhonor of Castile, my soul with pleasure was destining for you my\ndaughter. I know thy passion, and I am delighted to see that all its\nimpulses yield to thy duty; that they have not weakened this magnanimous\nardor; that thy proud manliness merits my esteem; and that, desiring as\na son-in-law an accomplished cavalier, I was not deceived in the choice\nwhich I had made. But I feel that for thee my compassion is touched. I\nadmire thy courage, and I pity thy youth. Seek not to make thy first\nattempt [_or_, maiden-stroke] fatal. Release my valor from an unequal\nconflict; too little honor for me would attend this victory. In\nconquering without danger we triumph without glory. Men would always\nbelieve that thou wert overpowered without an effort, and I should have\nonly regret for thy death.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Thy presumption is followed by a despicable [_lit._\nunworthy] pity! The man who dares to deprive me of honor, fears to\ndeprive me of life!\n\n_Count._ Withdraw from this place.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let us proceed without further parley.\n\n_Count._ Art thou so tired of life?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Hast thou such a dread of death?\n\n_Count._ Come, thou art doing thy duty, and the son becomes degenerate\nwho survives for one instant the honor of his father.\n\n\nScene III.--The INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and LEONORA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Soothe, my Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, soothe thy grief; summon up thy firmness\nin this sudden misfortune. Thou shalt see a calm again after this\nshort-lived [_lit._ feeble] storm. Thy happiness is overcast [_lit._\ncovered] only by a slight cloud, and thou hast lost nothing in seeing it\n[i.e. thine happiness] delayed.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ My heart, overwhelmed with sorrows, dares to hope for\nnothing; a storm so sudden, which agitates a calm at sea, conveys to us\na threat of an inevitable [_lit._ certain] shipwreck. I cannot doubt it:\nI am being shipwrecked [_lit._ I am perishing], even in harbor. I was\nloving, I was beloved, and our fathers were consenting [_lit._ in\nharmony], and I was recounting to you the delightful intelligence of\nthis at the fatal moment when this quarrel originated, the fatal recital\nof which, as soon as it has been given to you, has ruined the effect of\nsuch a dear [_lit._ sweet] expectation. Accursed ambition! hateful\nmadness! whose tyranny the most generous souls are suffering. O [sense\nof] honor!-merciless to my dearest desires, how many tears and sighs art\nthou going to cost me?\n\n_Infanta._ Thou hast, in their quarrel, no reason to be alarmed; one\nmoment has created it, one moment will extinguish it. It has made too\nmuch noise not to be settled amicably, since already the king wishes to\nreconcile them; and thou knowest that my zeal [_lit._ soul], keenly\nalive to thy sorrows, will do its utmost [_lit._ impossibilities] to dry\nup their source.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Reconciliations are not effected in such a feud [_or_, in\nthis manner]; such deadly insults are not [easily] repaired; in vain one\nuses [_lit._ causes to act] force or prudence. If the evil be cured, it\nis [cured] only in appearance; the hatred which hearts preserve within\nfeeds fires hidden, but so much the more ardent.\n\n_Infanta._ The sacred tie which will unite Don Rodrigo and Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne will\ndispel the hatred of their hostile sires, and we shall soon see the\nstronger [feeling], love, by a happy bridal, extinguish this discord.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I desire it may be so, more than I expect it. Don Diego is\ntoo proud, and I know my father. I feel tears flow, which I wish to\nrestrain; the past afflicts me, and I fear the future.\n\n_Infanta._ What dost thou fear? Is it the impotent weakness of an old\nman?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Rodrigo has courage.\n\n_Infanta._ He is too young.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Courageous men become so [i.e. courageous] at once.\n\n_Infanta._ You ought not, however, to dread him much. He is too much\nenamored to wish to displease you, and two words from thy lips would\narrest his rage.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If he does not obey me, what a consummation of my sorrow!\nAnd, if he can obey me, what will men say of him? being of such noble\nbirth, to endure such an insult! Whether he yields to, or resists the\npassion which binds him to me, my mind can not be otherwise than either\nashamed of his too great deference, or shocked at a just refusal.\n\n_Infanta._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne has a proud soul, and, though deeply interested, she\ncannot endure one base [_lit._  low] thought. But, if up to the day of\nreconciliation I make this model lover my prisoner, and I thus prevent\nthe effect of his courage, will thine enamored soul take no umbrage at\nit?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! dear lady, in that case I have no more anxiety.\n\n\nScene IV.--The INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, LEONORA, and a PAGE.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Page, seek Rodrigo, and bring him hither.\n\n_Page._ The Count de Gormas and he----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Good heavens! I tremble!\n\n_Infanta._ Speak.\n\n_Page._ From this palace have gone out together.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Alone?\n\n_Page._ Alone, and they seemed in low tones to be wrangling with each\nother.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Without doubt they are fighting; there is no further need of\nspeaking. Madame, forgive my haste [in thus departing]. [_Exeunt Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne\nand Page._]\n\n\nScene V.--The INFANTA and LEONORA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Alas! what uneasiness I feel in my mind! I weep for her\nsorrows, [yet still] her lover enthralls me; my calmness forsakes me,\nand my passion revives. That which is going to separate Rodrigo from\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne rekindles at once my hope and my pain; and their separation,\nwhich I see with regret, infuses a secret pleasure in mine enamored\nsoul.\n\n_Leonora._ This noble pride which reigns in your soul, does it so soon\nsurrender to this unworthy passion?\n\n_Infanta._ Call it not unworthy, since, seated in my heart, proud and\ntriumphant, it asserts its sway [_lit._ law] over me. Treat it with\nrespect, since it is so dear to me. My pride struggles against it, but,\nin spite of myself--I hope; and my heart, imperfectly shielded against\nsuch a vain expectation, flies after a lover whom Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne has lost.\n\n_Leonora._ Do you thus let this noble resolution give way [_lit._ fall]?\nAnd does reason in your mind thus lose its influence?\n\n_Infanta._ Ah! with how little effect do we listen to reason when the\nheart is assailed by a poison so delicious, and when the sick man loves\nhis malady! We can hardly endure that any remedy should be applied to\nit.\n\n_Leonora._ Your hope beguiles you, your malady is pleasant to you; but,\nin fact, this Rodrigo is unworthy of you.\n\n_Infanta._ I know it only too well; but if my pride yields, learn how\nlove flatters a heart which it possesses. If Rodrigo once [_or_, only]\ncomes forth from the combat as a conqueror, if this great warrior falls\nbeneath his valor, I may consider him worthy of me, and I may love him\nwithout shame. What may he not do, if he can conquer the Count? I dare\nto imagine that, as the least of his exploits, entire kingdoms will fall\nbeneath his laws; and my fond love is already persuaded that I behold\nhim seated on the throne of Granada, the vanquished Moors trembling\nwhile paying him homage; Arragon receiving this new conqueror, Portugal\nsurrendering, and his victorious battles [_lit._ noble days] advancing\nhis proud destinies beyond the seas, laving his laurels with the blood\nof Africans! In fine, all that is told of the most distinguished\nwarriors I expect from Rodrigo after this victory, and I make my love\nfor him the theme of my glory.\n\n_Leonora._ But, madam, see how far you carry his exploits [_lit._ arm]\nin consequence of a combat which, perhaps, has no reality!\n\n_Infanta._ Rodrigo has been insulted; the Count has committed the\noutrage; they have gone out together. Is there need of more?\n\n_Leonora._ Ah, well! they will fight, since you will have it so; but\nwill Rodrigo go so far as you are going?\n\n_Infanta._ Bear with me [_lit._ what do you mean]? I am mad, and my mind\nwanders; thou seest by that what evils this love prepares for me. Come\ninto my private apartment to console my anxieties, and do not desert me\nin the trouble I am in [at present].\n\n\nScene VI.--DON FERNANDO (the King), DON ARIAS, DON SANCHO, and DON\nALONZO.\n\n\n_Don Fernando._ The Count is, then, so presumptuous and so little\naccessible to reason? Does he still dare to believe his offence\npardonable?\n\n_Don Arias._ Sire, in your name I have long conversed with him. I have\ndone my utmost, and I have obtained nothing.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Just heavens! Thus, then, a rash subject has so little\nrespect and anxiety to please me! He insults Don Diego, and despises his\nKing! He gives laws to me in the midst of my court! Brave warrior\nthough he be, great general though he be, I am well able [_lit._ I shall\nknow well how] to tame such a haughty spirit! Were he incarnate valor\n[_lit._ valor itself], and the god of combats, he shall see what it is\nnot to obey! Whatever punishment such insolence may have deserved, I\nwished at first to treat it [_or,_ him] without violence; but, since he\nabuses my leniency, go instantly [_lit._ this very day], and, whether he\nresists or not, secure his person. [_Exit Don Alonzo._]\n\n_Don Sancho._ Perhaps a little time will render him less rebellious;\nthey came upon him still boiling with rage, on account of his quarrel.\nSire, in the heat of a first impulse, so noble a heart yields with\ndifficulty. He sees that he has done wrong, but a soul so lofty is not\nso soon induced to acknowledge its fault.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Don Sancho, be silent; and be warned that he who takes\nhis part renders himself criminal.\n\n_Don Sancho._ I obey, and am silent; but in pity, sire, [permit] two\nwords in his defence.\n\n_Don Fernando._ And what can you say?\n\n_Don Sancho._ That a soul accustomed to noble actions cannot lower\nitself to apologies. It does not imagine any which can be expressed\nwithout _shame;_ and it is that word alone that the Count resists. He\nfinds in his duty a little too much severity, and he would obey you if\nhe had less heart. Command that his arm, trained in war's dangers,\nrepair this injury at the point of the sword: he will give satisfaction,\nsire; and, come what may, until he has been made aware of your decision,\nhere am I to answer for him.\n\n_Don Fernando._ You fail [_lit._ you are losing] in respect; but I\npardon youth, and I excuse enthusiasm in a young, courageous heart. A\nking, whose prudence has better objects in view [than such quarrels],\nis more sparing of the blood of his subjects. I watch over mine; my\n[watchful] care protects them, as the head takes care of the limbs which\nserve it. Thus your reasoning is not reasoning for me. You speak as a\nsoldier--I must act as a king; and whatever others may wish to say, or\nhe may presume to think, the Count will not part with [_lit._ cannot\nlose] his glory by obeying me. Besides, the insult affects myself: he\nhas dishonored him whom I have made the instructor of my son. To impugn\nmy choice is to challenge me, and to make an attempt upon the supreme\npower. Let us speak of it no more. And now, ten vessels of our old\nenemies have been seen to hoist their flags; near the mouth of the river\nthey have dared to appear.\n\n_Don Arias._ The Moors have by force [of arms] learned to know you, and,\nso often vanquished, they have lost heart to risk their lives [_lit._\nthemselves] any more against so great a conqueror.\n\n_Don Fernando._ They will never, without a certain amount of jealousy,\nbehold my sceptre, in spite of them, ruling over Andalusia; and this\ncountry, so beautiful, which they too long enjoyed, is always regarded\nby them with an envious eye. This is the sole reason which has caused\nus, for the last ten years, to place the Castilian throne in Seville, in\norder to watch them more closely, and, by more prompt action,\nimmediately to overthrow whatever [design] they might undertake.\n\n_Don Arias._ They know, at the cost of their noblest leaders [_lit._\nmost worthy heads], how much your presence secures your conquests; you\nhave nothing to fear.\n\n_Don Fernando._ And nothing to neglect--too much confidence brings on\ndanger; and you are not ignorant that, with very little difficulty, the\nrising tide brings them hither. However, I should be wrong to cause a\npanic in the hearts [of the citizens], the news being uncertain. The\ndismay which this useless alarm might produce in the night, which is\napproaching, might agitate the town too much. Cause the guards to be\ndoubled on the walls and at the fort; for this evening that is\nsufficient.\n\n\nScene VII.--DON FERNANDO, DON ALONZO, DON SANCHO, and DON ARIAS.\n\n\n_Don Alonzo._ Sire, the Count is dead. Don Diego, by his son, has\navenged his wrong.\n\n_Don Fernando._ As soon as I knew of the insult I foresaw the vengeance,\nand from that moment I wished to avert this misfortune.\n\n_Don Alonzo._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne approaches to lay her grief at your feet [_lit._\nbrings to your knees her grief]; she comes all in tears to sue for\njustice from you.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Much though my soul compassionates her sorrows, what the\nCount has done seems to have deserved this just punishment of his\nrashness. Yet, however just his penalty may be, I cannot lose such a\nwarrior without regret. After long service rendered to my state, after\nhis blood has been shed for me a thousand times, to whatever thoughts\nhis [stubborn] pride compels me, his loss enfeebles me, and his death\nafflicts me.\n\n\nScene VIII.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, DON SANCHO, DON ARIAS,\nand DON ALONZO.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, sire, justice!\n\n_Don Diego._ Ah, sire, hear us!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I cast myself at your feet!\n\n_Don Diego._ I embrace your knees!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I demand justice.\n\n_Don Diego._ Hear my defence.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Punish the presumption of an audacious youth: he has struck\ndown the support of your sceptre--he has slain my father!\n\n_Don Diego._ He has avenged his own.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ To the blood of his subjects a king owes justice.\n\n_Don Diego._ For just vengeance there is no punishment.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Rise, both of you, and speak at leisure. Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, I\nsympathize with your sorrow; with an equal grief I feel my own soul\nafflicted. (_To Don Diego._) You shall speak afterwards; do not\ninterrupt her complaint.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, my father is dead! My eyes have seen his blood gush\nforth from his noble breast--that blood which has so often secured your\nwalls--that blood which has so often won your battles--that blood which,\nthough all outpoured, still fumes with rage at seeing itself shed for\nany other than for you! Rodrigo, before your very palace, has just dyed\n[_lit._ covered] the earth with that [blood] which in the midst of\ndangers war did not dare to shed! Faint and pallid, I ran to the spot,\nand I found him bereft of life. Pardon my grief, sire, but my voice\nfails me at this terrible recital; my tears and my sighs will better\ntell you the rest!\n\n_Don Fernando._ Take courage, my daughter, and know that from to-day thy\nking will serve thee as a father instead of him.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, my anguish is attended with too much [unavailing]\nhorror! I found him, I have already said, bereft of life; his breast was\npierced [_lit._ open], and his blood upon the [surrounding] dust\ndictated [_lit._ wrote] my duty; or rather his valor, reduced to this\ncondition, spoke to me through his wound, and urged me to claim redress;\nand to make itself heard by the most just of kings, by these sad lips,\nit borrowed my voice. Sire, do not permit that, under your sway, such\nlicense should reign before your [very] eyes; that the most valiant with\nimpunity should be exposed to the thrusts of rashness; that a\npresumptuous youth should triumph over their glory, should imbrue\nhimself with their blood, and scoff at their memory! If the valiant\nwarrior who has just been torn from you be not avenged, the ardor for\nserving you becomes extinguished. In fine, my father is dead, and I\ndemand vengeance more for your interest than for my consolation. You are\na loser in the death of a man of his position. Avenge it by another's,\nand [have] blood for blood! Sacrifice [the victim] not to me, but to\nyour crown, to your greatness, to yourself! Sacrifice, I say, sire, to\nthe good of the state, all those whom such a daring deed would inflate\nwith pride.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Don Diego, reply.\n\n_Don Diego._ How worthy of envy is he who, in losing [life's] vigor,\nloses life also! And how a long life brings to nobly minded men, at the\nclose of their career, an unhappy destiny! I, whose long labors have\ngained such great renown--I, whom hitherto everywhere victory has\nfollowed--I see myself to-day, in consequence of having lived too long,\nreceiving an insult, and living vanquished. That which never battle,\nsiege, or ambuscade could [do]--that which Arragon or Granada never\ncould [effect], nor all your enemies, nor all my jealous [rivals], the\nCount has done in your palace, almost before your eyes, [being] jealous\nof your choice, and proud of the advantage which the impotence of age\ngave him over me. Sire, thus these hairs, grown grey in harness [i.e.\ntoils of war]--this blood, so often shed to serve you--this arm,\nformerly the terror of a hostile army, would have sunk into the grave,\nburdened with disgrace, if I had not begotten a son worthy of me, worthy\nof his country, and worthy of his king! He has lent me his hand--he has\nslain the Count--he has restored my honor--he has washed away my shame!\nIf the displaying of courage and resentment, if the avenging of a blow\ndeserves chastisement, upon me alone should fall the fury of the storm.\nWhen the arm has failed, the head is punished for it. Whether men call\nthis a crime or not requires no discussion. Sire, I am the head, he is\nthe arm only. If Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne complains that he has slain her father, he\nnever would have done that [deed] if I could have done it [myself].\nSacrifice, then, this head, which years will soon remove, and preserve\nfor yourself the arm which can serve you. At the cost of my blood\nsatisfy Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne. I do not resist--I consent to my penalty, and, far from\nmurmuring at a rigorous decree, dying without dishonor, I shall die\nwithout regret.\n\n_Don Fernando._ The matter is of importance, and, calmly considered, it\ndeserves to be debated in full council. Don Sancho, re-conduct Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne\nto her abode. Don Diego shall have my palace and his word of honor as a\nprison. Bring his son here to me. I will do you justice.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It is just, great king, that a murderer should die.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Take rest, my daughter, and calm thy sorrows.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ To order me rest is to increase my misfortunes.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE THIRD.\n\n\nScene I.--DON RODRIGO and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Elvira._ Rodrigo, what hast them done? Whence comest thou, unhappy man?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Here [i.e. to the house of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne], to follow out the\nsad course of my miserable destiny.\n\n_Elvira._ Whence obtainest thou this audacity, and this new pride, of\nappearing in places which thou hast filled with mourning? What! dost\nthou come even here to defy the shade of the Count? Hast thou not slain\nhim?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ His existence was my shame; my honor required this deed\nfrom my [reluctant] hand.\n\n_Elvira._ But to seek thy asylum in the house of the dead! Has ever a\nmurderer made such his refuge?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ And I come here only to yield myself to my judge. Look no\nmore on me with astonishment [_lit._ an eye amazed]; I seek death after\nhaving inflicted it. My love is my judge; my judge is my Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne. I\ndeserve death for deserving her hatred, and I am come to receive, as a\nsupreme blessing, its decree from her lips, and its stroke from her\nhand.\n\n_Elvira._ Fly rather from her sight, fly from her impetuosity; conceal\nyour presence from her first excitement. Go! do not expose yourself to\nthe first impulses which the fiery indignation of her resentment may\ngive vent to.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ No, no. This beloved one, whom I [could] so displease,\ncannot have too wrathful a desire for my punishment; and I avoid a\nhundred deaths which are going to crush me if, by dying sooner, I can\nredouble it [i.e. that wrath].\n\n_Elvira._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne is at the palace, bathed in tears, and will return but\ntoo well accompanied. Rodrigo, fly! for mercy's sake relieve me from my\nuneasiness! What might not people say if they saw you here? Do you wish\nthat some slanderer, to crown her misery, should accuse her of\ntolerating here the slayer of her father? She will return; she is\ncoming--I see her; at least, for the sake of _her_ honor, Rodrigo,\nconceal thyself!                           [_Rodrigo conceals himself._]\n\n\nScene II.--DON SANCHO, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Don Sancho._ Yes, lady, you require a victim [or revenge] steeped in\nblood [_lit._ for you there is need of bleeding victims]; your wrath is\njust and your tears legitimate, and I do not attempt, by dint of\nspeaking, either to soothe you or to console you. But, if I may be\ncapable of serving you, employ my sword to punish the guilty [one],\nemploy my love to revenge this death; under your commands my arm will be\n[only] too strong.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Unhappy that I am!\n\n_Don Sancho._ I implore you, accept my services.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I should offend the King, who has promised me justice.\n\n_Don Sancho._ You know that justice [_lit._ it] proceeds with such\nslowness, that very often crime escapes in consequence of its delay, its\nslow and doubtful course causes us to lose too many tears. Permit that a\ncavalier may avenge you by [force of] arms; that method is more certain\nand more prompt in punishing.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It is the last remedy; and if it is necessary to have\nrecourse to it, and your pity for my misfortunes still continues, you\nshall then be free to avenge my injury.\n\n_Don Sancho._ It is the sole happiness to which my soul aspires; and,\nbeing able to hope for it, I depart too well contented.\n\n\nScene III.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ At last I see myself free, and I can, without constraint,\nshow thee the extent of my keen sorrows; I can give vent to my sad\nsighs; I can unbosom to thee my soul and all my griefs. My father is\ndead, Elvira; and the first sword with which Rodrigo armed himself has\ncut his thread of life. Weep, weep, mine eyes, and dissolve yourselves\ninto tears! The one half of my life [i.e. Rodrigo] has laid the other\n[half, i.e. my father] in the grave, and compels me to revenge, after\nthis fatal blow, that which I have no more [i.e. my father] on that\nwhich still remains to me [i.e. Rodrigo].\n\n_Elvira._ Calm yourself, dear lady.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! how unsuitably, in a misfortune so great, thou speakest\nof calmness. By what means can my sorrow ever be appeased, if I cannot\nhate the hand which has caused it? And what ought I to hope for but a\nnever-ending anguish if I follow up a crime, still loving the criminal.\n\n_Elvira._ He deprives you of a father, and you still love him?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It is too little to say love, Elvira; I adore him! My passion\nopposes itself to my resentment; in mine enemy I find my lover, and I\nfeel that in spite of all my rage Rodrigo is still contending against my\nsire in my heart. He attacks it, he besieges it; it yields, it defends\nitself; at one time strong, at one time weak, at another triumphant. But\nin this severe struggle between wrath and love, he rends my heart\nwithout shaking my resolution, and although my love may have power over\nme, I do not consult it [_or_, hesitate] to follow my duty. I speed on\n[_lit._ run] without halting [_or_, weighing the consequences] where my\nhonor compels me. Rodrigo is very dear to me; the interest I feel in him\ngrieves me; my heart takes his part, but, in spite of its struggles, I\nknow what I am [i.e. a daughter], and that my father is dead.\n\n_Elvira._ Do you think of pursuing [_or_, persecuting] him?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! cruel thought! and cruel pursuit to which I see myself\ncompelled. I demand his head [_or_, life] and I dread to obtain it; my\ndeath will follow his, and [yet] I wish to punish him!\n\n_Elvira._ Abandon, abandon, dear lady, a design so tragic, and do not\nimpose on yourself such a tyrannical law.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! my father being dead and almost in my arms--shall his\nblood cry for revenge and I not obtain it? My heart, shamefully led away\nby other spells, would believe that it owed him only ineffectual tears.\nAnd can I endure that an insidious love, beneath a dastardly apathy,\nshould extinguish my resolution [_lit._ beneath a cowardly silence\nextinguish my honor]?\n\n_Elvira._ Dear lady, believe me, you would be excusable in having less\nwrath against an object so beloved, against a lover so dear; you have\ndone enough, you have seen the King; do not urge on the result [of that\ninterview]. Do not persist in this morbid [_lit._ strange] humor.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ My honor is at stake; I must avenge myself; and, however the\ndesires of love may beguile us, all excuse [for not doing one's duty] is\ndisgraceful to [i.e. in the estimation of] noble-minded souls.\n\n_Elvira._ But you love Rodrigo--he cannot offend you.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I confess it.\n\n_Elvira._ After all, what then do you intend to do?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ To preserve my honor and to end my sorrow; to pursue him, to\ndestroy him, and to die after him.\n\n\nScene IV.--DON RODRIGO, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Well then, without giving you the trouble of pursuing me,\nsecure for yourself the honor of preventing me from living.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira, where are we, and what do I see? Rodrigo in my house!\nRodrigo before me!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Spare not my blood; enjoy [_lit._ taste], without\nresistance, the pleasure of my destruction and of your vengeance.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Alas!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Listen to me.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I am dying.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ One moment.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Go, let me die!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Four words only; afterwards reply to me only with this\nsword!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! still imbrued with the blood of my father!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ My Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Remove from my sight this hateful object, which brings as a\nreproach before mine eyes thy crime and thy existence.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Look on it rather to excite thy hatred, to increase thy\nwrath and to hasten my doom.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It is dyed with my [father's] blood!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Plunge it in mine, and cause it thus to lose the\ndeath-stain of thine own.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! what cruelty, which all in one day slays the father by\nthe sword [itself], and the daughter by the sight of it! Remove this\nobject, I cannot endure it; thou wished me to listen to thee, and thou\ncausest me to die!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I do what thou wishest, but without abandoning the desire\nof ending by thy hands my lamentable life; for, in fine, do not expect\n[even] from my affection a dastardly repentance of a justifiable [_lit._\ngood] action. The irreparable effect of a too hasty excitement\ndishonored my father and covered me with shame. Thou knowest how a blow\naffects a man of courage. I shared in the insult, I sought out its\nauthor, I saw him, I avenged my honor and my father; I would do it again\nif I had it to do. Not that, indeed, my passion did not long struggle\nfor thee against my father and myself; judge of its power--under such an\ninsult, I was able to deliberate whether I should take vengeance for it!\nCompelled to displease thee or to endure an affront, I thought that in\nits turn my arm was too prompt [to strike]; I accused myself of too much\nimpetuosity, and thy loveliness, without doubt, would have turned the\nscale [_or_, prevailed overall] had I not opposed to thy strongest\nattractions the [thought] that a man without honor would not merit thee;\nthat, in spite of this share which I had in thy affections, she who\nloved me noble would hate me shamed; that to listen to thy love, to obey\nits voice, would be to render myself unworthy of it and to condemn thy\nchoice. I tell thee still, and although I sigh at it, even to my last\nsigh I will assuredly repeat it, I have committed an offence against\nthee, and I was driven to [_or_, bound to commit] it to efface my shame\nand to merit thee; but discharged [from my duty] as regards honor, and\ndischarged [from duty] towards my father, it is now to thee that I come\nto give satisfaction--it is to offer to thee my blood that thou seest\nme in this place. I did my duty [_lit._ that which I ought to have done]\nthen, I still do it now. I know that a slain [_lit._ dead] father arms\nthee against my offence; I have not wished to rob thee of thy victim;\nsacrifice with courage to the blood he has lost he who constitutes his\nglory in having shed it.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah, Rodrigo, it is true, although thine enemy, I cannot blame\nthee for having shunned disgrace; and in whatever manner my griefs burst\nforth I do not accuse [thee], I [only] lament my misfortunes. I know\nwhat honor after such an insult demanded with ardor of a generous\ncourage; thou hast only done the duty of a man of honor, but also in\ndoing that [duty] thou hast taught me mine. Thy fatal valor has\ninstructed me by thy victory--it has avenged thy father and maintained\nthy glory. The same care concerns me, and I have to add to my infliction\n[_lit._ to afflict me] my fame to sustain and my father to avenge. Alas!\nthy fate [_or_, your share] in this drives me to despair! If any other\nmisfortune had taken from me my father, my soul would have found in the\nhappiness of seeing thee the only relief which it could have received,\nand in opposition to my grief I should have felt a fond delight [_lit._\ncharm or a magic soothing] when a hand so dear would have wiped away my\ntears. But I must lose thee after having lost him. This struggle over my\npassion is due to my honor, and this terrible duty, whose [imperious]\ncommand is slaying me, compels me to exert myself [_lit._ labor or work]\nfor thy destruction. For, in fine, do not expect from my affection any\nmorbid [_lit._ cowardly] feelings as to thy punishment. However strongly\nmy love may plead in thy favor, my steadfast courage must respond to\nthine. Even in offending me, thou hast proved thyself worthy of me; I\nmust, by thy death, prove myself worthy of thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Defer, then, no longer that which honor commands. It\ndemands my head [_or_, life], and I yield it to thee; make a sacrifice\nof it to this noble duty; the [death] stroke will be welcome [_lit._\nsweet], as well as the doom. To await, after my crime, a tardy justice,\nis to defer thine honor as well as my punishment. I should die too happy\nin dying by so delightful a [death] blow!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Go [i.e. no]; I am thy prosecutor, and not thy executioner.\nIf thou offerest me thine head, is it for me to take it; I ought to\nattack it, but thou oughtest to defend it. It is from another than thee\nthat I must obtain it, and it is my duty [_lit._ I ought] to pursue\nthee, but not to punish thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ However in my favor our love may plead, thy steadfast\ncourage ought to correspond to mine; and to borrow other arms to avenge\na father is, believe me, my Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, not the [method of] responding to\nit. My hand alone was fit [_lit._ has understood how] to avenge the\ninsult offered to _my_ father; thy hand alone ought to take vengeance\nfor thine.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ O cruel! for what reason shouldst thou persevere on this\npoint? Thou hast avenged thyself without aid, and dost thou wish to give\nme thine [aid]? I shall follow thy example; and I have too much courage\nto endure that my glory shall be divided with thee. My father and mine\nhonor shall owe nothing to the dictates of thy love and of thy despair.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ O cruel resolution [_lit._ point of honor]! Alas!\nwhatever I may do, can I by no means obtain this concession [_or_,\nfavor]? In the name of a slain [_lit._ dead] father, or of our\nfriendship, punish me through revenge, or at least through compassion.\nThy unhappy lover will have far less pain in dying by thy hand than in\nliving with thy hatred.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Go; I do not hate thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Thou oughtest to do so.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I cannot.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Dost thou so little fear calumny, and so little [fear]\nfalse reports? When people shall know my crime, and that thy passion\n[for me] still continues, what will not envy and deception spread\nabroad? Compel them to silence, and, without debating more, save thy\nfair fame by causing me to die.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ That [fair fame] shines far more gloriously [_lit._ better]\nby leaving thee life; and I wish that the voice of the blackest slander\nshould raise to heaven my honor, and lament my griefs, knowing that I\nworship thee, and that [still] I pursue thee [as a criminal]. Go, then;\npresent no more to my unbounded grief that which I [must] lose, although\nI love it [him]! In the shades of night carefully conceal thy departure;\nif they see thee going forth, my honor runs a risk. The only opportunity\nwhich slander can have is to know that I have tolerated thy presence\nhere. Give it no opportunity to assail my honor.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let me die.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Nay, leave me.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ On what art thou resolved?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ In spite of the glorious love-fires which impede [_lit._\ntrouble] my wrath, I will do my utmost to avenge my father; but, in\nspite of the sternness of such a cruel duty, my sole desire is to be\nable to accomplish nothing [against thee].\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ O wondrous love [_lit._ miracle of love]!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ O accumulation of sorrows!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ What misfortunes and tears will our fathers cost us!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Rodrigo, who would have believed----?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, who would have said----?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ That our happiness was so near, and would so soon be ruined?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ And that so near the haven, contrary to all appearances\n[_or_, expectation], a storm so sudden should shatter our hopes?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ O deadly griefs!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ O vain regrets!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Go, then, again [I beseech thee]; I can listen to thee no\nmore.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Adieu! I go to drag along a lingering life, until it be\ntorn from me by thy pursuit.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If I obtain my purpose, I pledge to thee my faith to exist\nnot a moment after thee. Adieu! Go hence, and, above all, take good care\nthat you are not observed.                         [_Exit Don Rodrigo._]\n\n_Elvira._ Dear lady, whatever sorrows heaven sends us----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Trouble me no more; let me sigh. I seek for silence and the\nnight in order to weep.\n\n\nScene V.--DON DIEGO.\n\n\nNever do we experience [_lit._ taste] perfect joy. Our most fortunate\nsuccesses are mingled with sadness; always some cares, [even] in the\n[successful] events, mar the serenity of our satisfaction. In the midst\nof happiness my soul feels their pang: I float in joy, and I tremble\nwith fear. I have seen [lying] dead the enemy who had insulted me, yet I\nam unable to find [_lit._ see] the hand which has avenged me. I exert\nmyself in vain, and with a useless anxiety. Feeble [_lit._ broken down;\n_or_, shattered] though I am, I traverse all the city; this slight\ndegree of vigor, that my advanced years have left me, expends itself\nfruitlessly in seeking this conqueror. At every moment, at all places,\nin a night so dark, I think that I embrace him, and I embrace only a\nshadow; and my love, beguiled by this deceitful object, forms for itself\nsuspicions which redouble my fear. I do not discover any traces of his\nflight. I fear the dead Count's friends and retinue; their number\nterrifies me, and confounds my reason. Rodrigo lives no more, or\nbreathes in prison! Just heavens! do I still deceive myself with a\nshadow only [_lit._ an appearance], or do I see, at last, my only hope?\nIt is he; I doubt it no more. My prayers are heard, my fear is\ndispelled, and my trouble ended.\n\n\nScene VI.--DON DIEGO and DON RODRIGO.\n\n\n_Don Diego._ Rodrigo at last heaven permits that I should behold thee!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Alas!\n\n_Don Diego._ Mingle not sighs with my joy; let me take breath in order\nto praise thee. My valor has no reason to disown thee; thou hast well\nimitated it, and thy brilliant prowess causes the heroes of my race to\nlive again in thee! It is from them that thou descendest, it is from me\nthat thou art sprung. Thy first combat [_lit._ sword-stroke] equals all\nof mine, and thy youth, fired with a splendid enthusiasm, by this great\nproof equals [_or_, reaches to] my renown. Prop of mine age, and sum of\nmy happiness, touch these white hairs, to which thou restorest honor!\nCome, kiss this cheek, and recognize the place on which was branded the\ninsult which thy courage effaces!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ The honor of it belongs to you. I could not do less,\nbeing sprung from you, and trained under your careful instruction\n[_lit._ cares]. I consider myself too happy [at the result], and my soul\nis delighted that my first combat [_or_, maiden-stroke] pleases him to\nwhom I owe existence. But, amidst your gladness, be not jealous if, in\nmy turn, I dare to satisfy myself after you. Permit that in freedom my\ndespair may burst forth; enough and for too long your discourse has\nsoothed it. I do not repent having served you; but give me back the\nblessing which that [death] blow has deprived me of. My arms, in order\nto serve you, battling against my passion, by this [otherwise] glorious\ndeed have deprived me of my love. Say no more to me: for you I have lost\nall; what I owed you I have well repaid.\n\n_Don Diego._ Carry, carry still higher the effect [_lit._ fruit] of thy\nvictory. I have given thee life, and thou restorest to me my honor; and\nas much as honor is dearer to me than life, so much now I owe thee in\nreturn. But spurn this weakness from a noble heart; we have but one\nhonor--there are many mistresses. Love is but a pleasure; honor is a\nduty.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Ah! what do you say to me?\n\n_Don Diego._ That which you ought to know.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ My outraged honor takes vengeance on myself, and you dare\nto urge me to the shame of inconstancy! Disgrace is the same, and\nfollows equally the soldier without courage and the faithless lover. Do\nno wrong, then, to my fidelity; allow me [to be] brave without rendering\nmyself perfidious [perjured]. My bonds are too strong to be thus\nbroken--my faith still binds me, though I [may] hope no more; and, not\nbeing able to leave nor to win Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, the death which I seek is my\nmost welcome [_lit._ sweeter] penalty.\n\n_Don Diego._ It is not yet time to seek death; thy prince and thy\ncountry have need of thine arm. The fleet, as was feared, having entered\nthis great river, hopes to surprise the city and to ravage the country.\nThe Moors are going to make a descent, and the tide and the night may,\nwithin an hour, bring them noiselessly to our walls. The court is in\ndisorder, the people in dismay; we hear only cries, we see only tears.\nIn this public calamity, my good fortune has so willed it that I have\nfound [thronging] to my house five hundred of my friends, who, knowing\nthe insult offered to me, impelled by a similar zeal, came all to offer\nthemselves to avenge my quarrel. Thou hast anticipated them; but their\nvaliant hands will be more nobly steeped in the blood of Africans. Go,\nmarch at their head where honor calls thee; it is thou whom their noble\nband would have as a leader. Go, resist the advance of these ancient\nenemies; there, if thou wishest to die, find a glorious death. Seize the\nopportunity, since it is presented to thee; cause your King to owe his\nsafety to your loss; but rather return from that battle-field [_lit._\nfrom it] with the laurels on thy brow. Limit not thy glory to the\navenging of an insult; advance that glory still further; urge by thy\nvalor this monarch to pardon, and Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne to peace. If thou lovest her,\nlearn that to return as a conqueror is the sole means of regaining her\nheart. But time is too precious to waste in words; I stop thee in thine\nattempted answer, and desire that thou fly [to the rescue]. Come, follow\nme; go to the combat, and show the King that what he loses in the Count\nhe regains in thee.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE FOURTH.\n\n\nScene I.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Is it not a false report? Do you know for certain, Elvira?\n\n_Elvira._ You could never believe how every one admires him, and extols\nto heaven, with one common voice, the glorious achievements of this\nyoung hero. The Moors appeared before him only to their shame; their\napproach was very rapid, their flight more rapid still. A three hours'\nbattle left to our warriors a complete victory, and two kings as\nprisoners. The valor of their leader overcame every obstacle [_lit._\nfound no obstacles].\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ And the hand of Rodrigo has wrought all these wonders!\n\n_Elvira._ Of his gallant deeds these two kings are the reward; by his\nhand they were conquered, and his hand captured them.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ From whom couldst thou ascertain these strange tidings?\n\n_Elvira._ From the people, who everywhere sing his praises, [who] call\nhim the object and the author of their rejoicing, their guardian angel\nand their deliverer.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ And the King--with what an aspect does he look upon such\nvalor?\n\n_Elvira._ Rodrigo dares not yet appear in his presence, but Don Diego,\ndelighted, presents to him in chains, in the name of this conqueror,\nthese crowned captives, and asks as a favor from this generous prince\nthat he condescend to look upon the hand which has saved the kingdom\n[_lit._ province].\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ But is he not wounded?\n\n_Elvira._ I have learned nothing of it. You change color! Recover your\nspirits.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Let me recover then also my enfeebled resentment; caring for\nhim, must I forget my own feelings [_lit._ myself]? They boast of him,\nthey praise him, and my heart consents to it; my honor is mute, my duty\nimpotent. Down [_lit._ silence], O [treacherous] love! let my resentment\nexert itself [_lit._ act]; although he has conquered two kings, he has\nslain my father! These mourning robes in which I read my misfortune are\nthe first-fruits which his valor has produced; and although others may\ntell of a heart so magnanimous, here all objects speak to me of his\ncrime. Ye who give strength to my feelings of resentment, veil, crape,\nrobes, dismal ornaments, funeral garb in which his first victory\nenshrouds me, do you sustain effectually my honor in opposition to my\npassion, and when my love shall gain too much power, remind my spirit of\nmy sad duty; attack, without fearing anything, a triumphant hand!\n\n_Elvira._ Calm this excitement; see--here comes the Infanta.\n\n\nScene II.--The INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, LEONORA, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ I do not come here [vainly] to console thy sorrows; I come\nrather to mingle my sighs with thy tears.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Far rather take part in the universal rejoicings, and taste\nthe happiness which heaven sends you, dear lady; no one but myself has a\nright to sigh. The danger from which Rodrigo has been able to rescue\nyou, and the public safety which his arms restore to you, to me alone\nto-day still permit tears; he has saved the city, he has served his\nKing, and his valiant arm is destructive only to myself.\n\n_Infanta._ My Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, it is true that he has wrought wonders.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Already this vexatious exclamation of joy [_lit._ noise] has\nreached [_lit._ struck] my ears, and I hear him everywhere proclaimed\naloud as brave a warrior as he is an unfortunate lover.\n\n_Infanta._ What annoyance can the approving shouts of the people cause\nthee? This youthful Mars whom they praise has hitherto been able to\nplease thee; he possessed thy heart; he lived under thy law; and to\npraise his valor is to honor thy choice.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Every one [else] can praise it with some justice; but for me\nhis praise is a new punishment. They aggravate my grief by raising him\nso high. I see what I lose, when I see what he is worth. Ah! cruel\ntortures to the mind of a lover! The more I understand his worth, the\nmore my passion increases; yet my duty is always the stronger [passion],\nand, in spite of my love, endeavors to accomplish his destruction\n[_lit._ to pursue his death].\n\n_Infanta._ Yesterday, this duty placed thee in high estimation; the\nstruggle which thou didst make appeared so magnanimous, so worthy of a\nnoble heart, that everyone at the court admired thy resolution and\npitied thy love. But wilt thou believe in the advice of a faithful\nfriendship?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Not to obey you would render me disloyal.\n\n_Infanta._ What was justifiable then is not so to-day. Rodrigo now is\nour sole support, the hope and the idol [_lit._ love] of a people that\nworships him! The prop of Castile and the terror of the Moor! The King\nhimself recognizes [_lit._ is in agreement with] this truth, that thy\nfather in him alone sees himself recalled to life: and if, in fine, thou\nwishest that I should explain myself briefly [_lit._ in two words],\nthou art seeking in his destruction the public ruin. What! to avenge a\nfather, is it ever lawful to surrender one's country into the hands of\nenemies? Against us is thy revenge lawful? And must we be punished who\nhad no share in the crime? After all, it is only that thou shouldest\nespouse the man whom a dead father compelled thee to accuse; I myself\nwould wish to relieve thee of that desire [_lit._ take the desire of\nthat from thee]; take from him thy love, but leave us his life.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! it is not in me to have so much kindness; the duty which\nexcites me has no limit. Although my love pleads [_lit._ interests\nitself] for this conqueror, although a nation worships him, and a King\npraises him, although he be surrounded with the most valiant warriors, I\nshall endeavor to crush his laurels beneath my [funereal] cypress.\n\n_Infanta._ It is a noble feeling when, to avenge a father, our duty\nassails a head so dear; but it is duty of a still nobler order when ties\nof blood are sacrificed to the public [advantage]. No, believe me, it is\nenough to quench thy love; he will be too severely punished if he exists\nno more in thy affections. Let the welfare of thy country impose upon\nthee this law; and, besides, what dost thou think that the King will\ngrant thee?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ He can refuse me, but I cannot keep silent.\n\n_Infanta._ Reflect well, my [dear] Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, on what thou wishest to do.\nAdieu; [when] alone thou cans't think over this at thy leisure. [_Exit\nthe Infanta._]\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Since my father is slain [_lit._ after my dead father], I\nhave no [alternative] to choose.\n\n\nScene III.--DON FERNANDO (the King), DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON\nRODRIGO, and DON SANCHO.\n\n\n_Don Fernando._ Worthy scion of a distinguished race, which has always\nbeen the glory and the support of Castile! Thou descendant of so many\nancestors signalized by valor, whom the first attempt of thine own\n[prowess] has so soon equalled; my ability to recompense thee is too\nlimited [_lit._ small], and I have less power than thou hast merit. The\ncountry delivered from such a fierce enemy, my sceptre firmly placed in\nmy hand by thine own [hand], and the Moors defeated before, amid these\nterrors, I could give orders for repulsing their arms; these are\nbrilliant services which leave not to thy King the means or the hope of\ndischarging his debt of gratitude [_lit._ acquitting himself] towards\nthee. But the two kings, thy captives, shall be thy reward. Both of them\nin my presence have named thee their Cid--since Cid, in their language,\nis equivalent to lord, I shall not envy thee this glorious title of\ndistinction; be thou, henceforth, the Cid; to that great name let\neverything yield; let it overwhelm with terror both Granada and Toledo,\nand let it indicate to all those who live under my laws both how\nvaluable thou art to me [_lit._ that which thou art worth to me], and\nthat [deep obligation] which I owe thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let your majesty, sire, spare my modesty. On such an\nhumble service your majesty [_lit._ it, referring to majesty] sets too\nhigh a value, and compels me to blush [for shame] before so great a\nKing, at so little deserving the honor which I have received from him. I\nknow too well [the gifts] that I owe to the welfare of your empire, both\nthe blood which flows in my veins [_lit._ animates me] and the air which\nI breathe, and even though I should lose them in such a glorious cause\n[_lit._ for an object so worthy], I should only be doing the duty of a\nsubject.\n\n_Don Fernando._ All those whom that duty enlists in my service do not\ndischarge it with the same courage, and when [i.e. unless] valor\nattains a high degree, it never produces such rare successes; allow us\nthen to praise thee, and tell me more at length the true history of this\nvictory.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Sire, you are aware that in this urgent danger, which\ncreated in the city such a powerful alarm, a band of friends assembled\nat the house of my father prevailed on my spirit, still much agitated.\nBut, sire, pardon my rashness if I dared to employ it without your\nauthority; the danger was approaching; their [valiant] band was ready;\nby showing myself at the court I should have risked my life [_lit._\nhead], and, if I must lose it, it would have been far more delightful\nfor me to depart from life while fighting for you.\n\n_Don Fernando._ I pardon thy warmth in avenging the insult offered to\nthee, and the kingdom shielded [from danger] pleads [_lit._ speaks to\nme] in thy defence. Be assured that henceforth Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne will speak in\nvain, and I shall listen to her no more except to comfort her; but\ncontinue.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Under me, then, this band advances, and bears in its\naspect a manly confidence. At setting out we were five hundred, but, by\na speedy reinforcement, we saw ourselves [augmented to] three thousand\non arriving at the port; so surely, on beholding us advance with such a\n[determined] aspect, did the most dismayed recover their courage. Of\nthat brave host [_lit._ of it], as soon as we had arrived, I conceal\ntwo-thirds in the holds of the ships which were found there; the rest,\nwhose numbers were increasing every hour, burning with impatience,\nremain around me; they lie down on the ground, and, without making any\nnoise, they pass a considerable portion of so auspicious [_lit._\nbeautiful] a night. By my command the guard does the same, and keeping\nthemselves, concealed aid my stratagem, and I boldly pretended to have\nreceived from you the order which they see me follow out, and which I\nissue to all. This dim light which falls from the stars, at last with\nthe tide causes us to see thirty vessels [_lit._ sails]; the wave\n[i.e. the water] swells beneath them, and, with a mutual effort, the\nMoors and the sea advance even to the port. We let them pass; all seems\nto them lulled in repose [_lit._ tranquil]. No soldiers at the port,\nnone on the walls of the city. Our deep silence deceiving their minds,\nthey no longer dare to doubt that they had taken us by surprise. They\nland without fear, they cast anchor, they disembark and rush forward to\ndeliver themselves into the hands which are awaiting them. Then we\narise, and all at the same time utter towards heaven countless ringing\ncheers [of defiance]. At these shouts our men from our ships answer [to\nthe signal]; they appear armed, the Moors are dismayed, terror seizes\nthose who had scarcely disembarked, before fighting they consider\nthemselves lost--they hastened to plunder and they meet with war. We\npress them hard on the water, we press them hard on the land, and we\ncause rivulets of their blood to run before any [of them] can resist or\nregain his position. But soon, in spite of us, their princes rally them,\ntheir courage revives, and their fears are forgotten. The disgrace of\ndying without having fought rallies their disordered ranks [_lit._ stops\ntheir disorder], and restores to them their valor. With firmly planted\nfeet they draw their scimitars against us, and cause a fearful\nintermingling of our blood with theirs; and the land, and the wave, and\nthe fleet, and the port are fields of carnage where death is\ntriumphant. Oh! how many noble deeds, how many brilliant achievements,\nwere performed unnoticed [_lit._ have remained without renown] in the\nmidst of the gloom, in which each [warrior], sole witness of the\nbrilliant strokes which he gave, could not discern to which side fortune\ninclined. I went in all directions to encourage our soldiers, to cause\nsome to advance, and to support others, to marshal those who were coming\nup, to urge them forward in their turn, and I could not ascertain the\nresult [of the conflict] until the break of day. But at last the bright\ndawn shows us our advantage. The Moor sees his loss and loses courage\nsuddenly, and, seeing a reinforcement which had come to assist us, the\nardor for conquest yields to the dread of death. They gain their ships,\nthey cut their cables, they utter even to heaven terrific cries, they\nmake their retreat in confusion and without reflecting whether their\nkings can escape with them. Their fright is too strong to admit of this\nduty. The incoming tide brought them here, the outgoing tide carries\nthem away. Meanwhile their kings, combating amongst us, and a few of\ntheir [warriors] severely wounded by our blows, still fight valiantly\nand sell their lives dearly. I myself in vain urge them to surrender;\nscimitar in hand, they listen not to my entreaties, but seeing all their\nsoldiers falling at their feet, and that henceforward alone they defend\nthemselves in vain, they ask for the commander; I entitle myself as\nsuch, and they surrender. I sent you them both at the same time, and the\ncombat ceased for want of combatants. It is in this manner that for your\nservice----\n\n\nScene IV.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON RODRIGO, DON ARIAS, DON ALONZO,\nand DON SANCHO.\n\n\n_Don Alonzo._ Sire, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne comes to demand justice from you.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Vexatious news and unwelcome duty! Go [Rodrigo]; I do\nnot wish her to see thee. Instead of thanks I must drive thee away; but,\nbefore departing, come, let thy King embrace thee!\n\n[_Exit Don Rodrigo._]\n\n_Don Diego._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne pursues him, [yet] she wishes to save him.\n\n_Don Fernando._ They say that she loves him, and I am going to prove it.\nExhibit a more sorrowful countenance [_lit._ eye].\n\n\nScene V.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON SANCHO, DON ALONZO,\nCHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Don Fernando._ At last, be content, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, success responds to your\nwishes. Although Rodrigo has gained the advantage over our enemies, he\nhas died before our eyes of the wounds he has received; return thanks to\nthat heaven which has avenged you. (_To Don Diego._) See, how already\nher color is changed!\n\n_Don Diego._ But see! she swoons, and in this swoon, sire, observe the\neffect of an overpowering [_lit._ perfect] love. Her grief has betrayed\nthe secrets of her soul, and no longer permits you to doubt her passion.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What, then! Is Rodrigo dead?\n\n_Don Fernando._ No, no, he still lives [_lit._ he sees the day]; and he\nstill preserves for you an unalterable affection; calm this sorrow which\ntakes such an interest in his favor.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, we swoon from joy, as well as from grief; an excess of\npleasure renders us completely exhausted, and when it takes the mind by\nsurprise, it overpowers the senses.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Dost thou wish that in thy favor we should believe in\nimpossibilities? Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, thy grief appeared too clearly visible.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Well, sire! add this crown to my misfortune--call my swoon\nthe effect of my grief; a justifiable dissatisfaction reduced me to that\nextremity; his death would have saved his head from my pursuit. If he\nhad died of wounds received for the benefit of his country, my revenge\nwould have been lost, and my designs betrayed; such a brilliant end [of\nhis existence] would have been too injurious to me. I demand his death,\nbut not a glorious one, not with a glory which raises him so high, not\non an honorable death-bed, but upon a scaffold. Let him die for my\nfather and not for his country; let his name be attainted and his memory\nblighted. To die for one's country is not a sorrowful doom; it is to\nimmortalize one's self by a glorious death! I love then his victory, and\nI can do so without criminality; it [the victory] secures the kingdom\nand yields to me my victim. But ennobled, but illustrious amongst all\nwarriors, the chief crowned with laurels instead of flowers--and to say\nin a word what I think--worthy of being sacrificed to the shade of my\nfather. Alas! by what [vain] hope do I allow myself to be carried away?\nRodrigo has nothing to dread from me; what can tears which are despised\navail against him? For him your whole empire is a sanctuary [_lit._ a\nplace of freedom]; there, under your power, everything is lawful for\nhim; he triumphs over me as [well as] over his enemies; justice stifled\nin their blood that has been shed, serves as a new trophy for the crime\nof the conqueror. We increase its pomp, and contempt of the law causes\nus to follow his [triumphal] chariot between two kings.\n\n_Don Fernando._ My daughter, these transports are too violent [_lit._\nhave too much violence]. When justice is rendered, all is put in the\nscale. Thy father has been slain, he was the aggressor; and justice\nitself commands me [to have] mercy. Before accusing that [degree of\nclemency] which I show, consult well thine heart; Rodrigo is master of\nit; and thy love in secret returns thanks to thy King, whose favor\npreserves such a lover for thee.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ For me! my enemy! the object of my wrath! the author of my\nmisfortunes? the slayer of my father! To my just pursuit [of vengeance]\nthey pay so little attention, that they believe that they are conferring\na favor on me by not listening to it. Since you refuse justice to my\ntears, sire, permit me to have recourse to arms; it is by that alone\nthat he has been able to injure me, and it is by that (means) also that\nI ought to avenge myself. From all your knights I demand his head; yes,\nlet one of them bring it to me, and I will be his prize; let them fight\nhim, sire, and, the combat being finished, I [will] espouse the\nconqueror, if Rodrigo is slain [_lit._ punished]. Under your authority,\npermit this to be made public.\n\n_Don Fernando._ This ancient custom established in these places, under\nthe guise of punishing an unjust affront, weakens a kingdom [by\ndepriving it] of its best warriors; the deplorable success of this abuse\n[of power] often crushes the innocent and shields the guilty. From this\n[ordeal] I release Rodrigo; he is too precious to me to expose him to\nthe [death] blows of capricious fate; and whatever (offence) a heart so\nmagnanimous could commit, the Moors, in retreating, have carried away\nhis crime.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What, sire, for him alone you reverse the laws, which all the\ncourt has so often seen observed! What will your people think, and what\nwill envy say, if he screens his life beneath your shield and he makes\nit a pretext not to appear [on a scene] where all men of honor seek a\nnoble death? Such favors would too deeply tarnish his glory; let him\nenjoy [_lit._ taste] without shame [_lit._ blushing] the fruits of his\nvictory. The count had audacity, he was able to punish him for it; he\n[i.e. Rodrigo] acted like a man of courage, and ought to maintain it\n[that character].\n\n_Don Fernando._ Since you wish it, I grant that he shall do so; but a\nthousand others would take the place of a vanquished warrior, and the\nreward which Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne has promised to the conqueror would render all my\ncavaliers his enemies; to oppose him alone to all would be too great an\ninjustice; it is enough, he shall enter the lists once only. Choose who\n[what champion] you will, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and choose well; but after this\ncombat ask nothing more.\n\n_Don Diego._ Release not by that those whom his valor [_lit._ arm]\nterrifies; leave an open field which none will [dare to] enter. After\nwhat Rodrigo has shown us to-day, what courage sufficiently presumptuous\nwould dare to contend with him? Who would risk his life against such an\nopponent? Who will be this valiant, or rather this rash individual?\n\n_Don Sancho._ Open the lists, you see this assailant; I am this rash or\nrather this valiant [champion]. Grant this favor to the zeal which urges\nme on; dear lady, you know what your promise is.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, do you confide your quarrel to his hand?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, I have promised it.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Be ready to-morrow.\n\n_Don Diego._ No, sire, there is no need to defer the contest; a man is\nalways ready when he possesses courage.\n\n_Don Fernando._ [What!] To come forth from one battle and to (instantly)\nenter the lists [_lit._ to fight]?\n\n_Don Diego._ Rodrigo has regained breath in relating to you this [i.e.\nthe history of that battle].\n\n_Don Fernando._ I desire that he should rest at least an hour or two;\nbut, for fear that such a combat may be considered as a precedent, to\ntestify to all that I permit, with regret, a sanguinary ordeal which has\nnever pleased me, it shall not have the presence either of myself or of\nmy court. [_To Don Arias._] You alone shall judge of the valor of the\ncombatants. Take care that both act like men of honor [_lit._ courage],\nand, the combat ended, bring the victor to me. Whoever he may be, the\nsame reward is gained by his exertions; I desire with my own hand to\npresent him to Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and that, as a recompense, he may receive her\nplighted faith.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What, sire! [would you] impose on me so stern a law?\n\n_Don Fernando._ Thou complainest of it; but thy love, far from\nacknowledging thy complaint, if Rodrigo be the conqueror, without\nrestraint accepts [the conditions]. Cease to murmur against such a\ngentle decree; whichever of the two be the victor, I shall make him thy\nspouse.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE FIFTH.\n\n\nScene I.--DON RODRIGO and CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! Rodrigo! In broad daylight! Whence comes this audacity?\nGo, thou art ruining my honor; retire, I beseech thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I go to die, dear lady, and I come to bid you in this\nplace, before the mortal blow, a last adieu. This unchangeable love,\nwhich binds me beneath your laws, dares not to accept my death without\npaying to you homage for it.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Thou art going to death!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I speed to those happy moments which will deliver my life\nfrom your (feelings of) resentment.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Thou art going to death! Is Don Sancho, then, so formidable,\nthat he can inspire terror in this invincible heart? What has rendered\nthee so weak? or what renders him so strong? Does Rodrigo go to fight,\nand believe himself already slain [_lit._ dead]? He who has not feared\nthe Moors nor my father, goes to fight Don Sancho, and already despairs?\nThus, then, thy courage lowers itself in the [hour of] need.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I speed [_lit._ I run] to my punishment, and not to the\ncombat; and, since you seek my death, my faithful ardor will readily\ndeprive me of the desire of defending my life. I have always the same\ncourage, but I have not the [strong] arm, when it is needed, to preserve\nthat which does not please you; and already this night would have been\nfatal to me, if I had fought for my own private wrong; but, defending my\nking, his people, and my country, by carelessly defending myself, I\nshould have betrayed _them_. My high-born spirit does not hate life so\nmuch as to wish to depart from it by perfidy, now that it regards my\ninterests only. You demand my death--I accept its decree. Your\nresentment chose the hand of another; I was unworthy [_lit._ I did not\ndeserve] to die by yours. They shall not see me repel its blows; I owe\nmore respect to him [the champion] who fights for you; and delighted to\nthink that it is from you these [blows] proceed--since it is your honor\nthat his arms sustain--I shall present to him my unprotected [_or_,\ndefenceless] breast, worshipping through his hand thine that destroys\nme.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If the just vehemence of a sad [sense of] duty, which causes\nme, in spite of myself, to follow after thy valiant life, prescribes to\nthy love a law so severe, that it surrenders thee without defence to him\nwho combats for me, in this infatuation [_lit._ blindness], lose not the\nrecollection, that, with thy life, thine honor is tarnished, and that,\nin whatever renown Rodrigo may have lived, when men shall know him to be\ndead, they will believe him conquered. Thine honor is dearer to thee\nthan I am dear, since it steeps thine hands in the blood of my father,\nand causes thee to renounce, in spite of thy love, the sweet hope of\ngaining me. I see thee, however, pay such little regard to it [honor],\nthat, without fighting, thou wishest to be overcome. What inconsistency\n[_lit._ unequality] mars thy valor! Why hast thou it [that valor] no\nmore? or why didst thou possess it [formerly]? What! art thou valiant\nonly to do me an injury? Unless it be to offend [_or_, injure] me, hast\nthou no courage at all? And dost thou treat my father with such rigor\n[i.e. so far disparage the memory of my father], that, after having\nconquered him, thou wilt endure a conqueror? Go! without wishing to die,\nleave me to pursue thee, and defend thine honor, if thou wilt no longer\nlive.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ After the death of the count and the defeat of the\nMoors, will my renown still require other achievements? That [glory] may\nscorn the care of defending myself; it is known that my courage dares to\nattempt all, that my valor can accomplish all, and that, here below\n[_lit._ under the heavens], in comparison with mine honor, nothing is\nprecious to me. No! no! in this combat, whatever thou may'st please to\nthink, Rodrigo may die without risking his renown: without men daring to\naccuse him of having wanted spirit: without being considered as\nconquered, without enduring a conqueror. They will say only: \"He adored\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne; he would not live and merit her hatred; he yielded himself to\nthe severity of his fate, which compelled his mistress to seek his\ndeath; she wished for his life [_lit._ head], and his magnanimous heart,\nhad that been refused to her, would have considered it a crime. To\navenge his honor, he lost his love; to avenge his mistress, he forsook\nlife, preferring (whatever hope may have enslaved his soul) his honor to\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne to his existence.\" Thus, then, you will see that my\ndeath in this conflict, far from obscuring my glory, will increase its\nvalue; and this honor will follow my voluntary death, that no other than\nmyself could have satisfied you [for the death of your father].\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Since, to prevent thee from rushing to destruction, thy life\nand thine honor are [but] feeble inducements, if ever I loved thee, dear\nRodrigo, in return [for that love], defend thyself now, to rescue me\nfrom Don Sancho. Fight, to release me from a compact which delivers me\nto the object of my aversion. Shall I say more to thee? Go, think of thy\ndefence, to overcome my sense of duty, to impose on me silence; and if\nthou feelest thine heart still enamored for me, come forth, as a\nconqueror, from a combat of which Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne is the reward. Adieu; this\nthoughtlessly uttered [_lit._ let slip] word causes me to blush for\nshame!\n\n[_Exit Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._]\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Where is the foe I could not now subdue? Come forth,\n[warriors] of Navarre, Morocco, and Castile! and all the heroes that\nSpain has produced; unite together and form an army, to contend against\none hand thus nerved [to action]. Unite all your efforts against a hope\nso sweet--you have too little power to succeed in destroying it!\n\n\nScene II.--THE INFANTA.\n\n\nShall I listen to thee still, pride of my birth, that makest a crime out\nof my passions? Shall I listen to thee, love, whose delicious power\ncauses my desires to rebel against this proud tyrant? Poor princess! to\nwhich of the two oughtest thou to yield obedience? Rodrigo, thy valor\nrenders thee worthy of me; but although thou art valiant, thou art not\nthe son of a king.\n\nPitiless fate, whose severity separates my glory and my desires! Is it\ndecreed [_lit._ said], that the choice of [a warrior of] such rare merit\nshould cost my passion such great anguish? O heaven! for how many\nsorrows [_lit._ sighs] must my heart prepare itself, if, after such a\nlong, painful struggle, it never succeeds in either extinguishing the\nlove, or accepting the lover!\n\nBut there are too many scruples, and my reason is alarmed at the\ncontempt of a choice so worthy; although to monarchs only my [proud]\nbirth may assign me, Rodrigo, with honor I shall live under thy laws.\nAfter having conquered two kings, couldst thou fail in obtaining a\ncrown? And this great name of Cid, which thou hast just now won--does it\nnot show too clearly over whom thou art destined to reign?\n\nHe is worthy of me, but he belongs to Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne; the present which I made\nof him [to her], injures me. Between them, the death of a father has\ninterposed so little hatred, that the duty of blood with regret pursues\nhim. Thus let us hope for no advantage, either from his transgression or\nfrom my grief, since, to punish me, destiny has allowed that love should\ncontinue even between two enemies.\n\n\nScene III.--THE INFANTA and LEONORA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Whence [i.e. for what purpose] comest thou, Leonora?\n\n_Leonora._ To congratulate you, dear lady, on the tranquillity which at\nlast your soul has recovered.\n\n_Infanta._ From what quarter can tranquillity come [_lit._ whence should\nthis tranquillity come], in an accumulation of sorrow?\n\n_Leonora._ If love lives on hope, and if it dies with it, Rodrigo can no\nmore charm your heart; you know of the combat in which Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne involves\nhim; since he must die in it, or become her husband, your hope is dead\nand your spirit is healed.\n\n_Infanta._ Ah! how far from it!\n\n_Leonora._ What more can you expect?\n\n_Infanta._ Nay, rather, what hope canst thou forbid me [to entertain]?\nIf Rodrigo fights under these conditions, to counteract the effect of it\n[that conflict], I have too many resources. Love, this sweet author of\nmy cruel punishments, puts into [_lit._ teaches] the minds of lovers too\nmany stratagems.\n\n_Leonora._ Can _you_ [accomplish] anything, since a dead father has not\nbeen able to kindle discord in their minds? For Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne clearly shows by\nher behavior that hatred to-day does not cause her pursuit. She obtains\nthe [privilege of a] combat, and for her champion, she accepts on the\nmoment the first that offers. She has not recourse to those renowned\nknights [_lit._ noble hands] whom so many famous exploits render so\nglorious; Don Sancho suffices her, and merits her choice, because he is\ngoing to arm himself for the first time; she loves in this duel his want\nof experience; as he is without renown, [so] is she without\napprehension; and her readiness [to accept him], ought to make you\nclearly see that she seeks for a combat which her duty demands, but\nwhich yields her Rodrigo an easy victory, and authorizes her at length\nto seem appeased.\n\n_Infanta._ I observe it clearly; and nevertheless my heart, in rivalry\nwith Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, adores this conqueror. On what shall I resolve, hopeless\nlover that I am?\n\n_Leonora._ To remember better from whom you are sprung. Heaven owes you\na king; you love a subject!\n\n_Infanta._ The object of my attachment has completely changed: I no\nlonger love Rodrigo as a mere nobleman. No; it is not thus that my love\nentitles him. If I love him, it is [as] the author of so many brilliant\ndeeds; it is [as] the valiant Cid, the master of two kings. I shall\nconquer myself, however; not from dread of any censure, but in order\nthat I may not disturb so glorious a love; and even though, to favor me,\nthey should crown him, I will not accept again [_lit._ take back] a gift\nwhich I have given. Since in such a combat his triumph is certain, let\nus go once more to give him [_or_, that gift] to Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne. And thou, who\nseest the love-arrows with which my heart is pierced; come see me finish\nas I have begun.\n\n\nScene IV.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira, how greatly I suffer; and how much I am to be pitied!\nI know not what to hope, and I see everything to be dreaded. No wish\nescapes me to which I dare consent. I desire nothing without quickly\nrepenting of it [_lit._ a quick repentance]. I have caused two rivals to\ntake up arms for me: the most happy result will cause me tears; and\nthough fate may decree in my favor, my father is without revenge, or my\nlover is dead.\n\n_Elvira._ On the one side and the other I see you consoled; either you\nhave Rodrigo, or you are avenged. And however fate may ordain for you,\nit maintains your honor and gives you a spouse.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! the object of my hatred or of such resentment!--the\nslayer of Rodrigo, or that of my father! In either case [_lit._ on all\nsides] they give me a husband, still [all] stained with the blood that I\ncherished most; in either case my soul revolts, and I fear more than\ndeath the ending of my quarrel. Away! vengeance, love--which agitate my\nfeelings. Ye have no gratifications for me at such a price; and Thou,\nPowerful Controller of the destiny which afflicts me, terminate this\ncombat without any advantage, without rendering either of the two\nconquered or conqueror.\n\n_Elvira._ This would be treating you with too much severity. This combat\nis a new punishment for your feelings, if it leaves you [still]\ncompelled to demand justice, to exhibit always this proud resentment,\nand continually to seek after the death of your lover. Dear lady, it is\nfar better that his unequalled valor, crowning his brow, should impose\nsilence upon you; that the conditions of the combat should extinguish\nyour sighs; and that the King should compel you to follow your\ninclinations.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If he be conqueror, dost thou believe that I shall\nsurrender? My strong [sense of] duty is too strong and my loss too\ngreat; and this [law of] combat and the will of the King are not strong\nenough to dictate conditions to them [i.e. to my duty and sorrow for\nmy loss]. He may conquer Don Sancho with very little difficulty, but he\nshall not with him [conquer] the sense of duty of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne; and whatever\n[reward] a monarch may have promised to his victory, my self-respect\nwill raise against him a thousand other enemies.\n\n_Elvira._ Beware lest, to punish this strange pride, heaven may at last\npermit you to revenge yourself. What!--you will still reject the\nhappiness of being able now to be reconciled [_lit._ to be silent] with\nhonor? What means this duty, and what does it hope for? Will the death\nof your lover restore to you a father? Is one [fatal] stroke of\nmisfortune insufficient for you? Is there need of loss upon loss, and\nsorrow upon sorrow? Come, in the caprice in which your humor persists,\nyou do not deserve the lover that is destined for you, and we may\n[_lit._ shall] see the just wrath of heaven, by his death, leaving you\nDon Sancho as a spouse.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira, the griefs which I endure are sufficient: do not\nredouble them by this fatal augury. I wish, if I can, to avoid both; but\nif not, in this conflict Rodrigo has all my prayers; not because a weak\n[_lit._ foolish] affection inclines me to his side, but because, if he\nwere conquered, I should become [the bride] of Don Sancho. This fear\ncreates [_lit._ causes to be born] my desire----\n\n            [_Enter Don Sancho._]\n\nWhat do I see, unhappy [woman that I am]! Elvira, all is lost!\n\n\nScene V.--DON SANCHO, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Don Sancho._ Compelled to bring this sword to thy feet----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! still [all] reeking with the blood of Rodrigo! Traitor,\ndost thou dare to show thyself before mine eyes, after having taken from\nme that [being] whom I love the best? Declare thyself my love, and thou\nhast no more to fear. My father is satisfied; cease to restrain thyself.\nThe same [death] stroke has placed my honor in safety, my soul in\ndespair, and my passion at liberty!\n\n_Don Sancho._ With a mind more calmly collected----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Dost thou still speak to me, detestable assassin of a hero\nwhom I adore? Go; you fell upon him treacherously. A warrior so valiant\nwould never have sunk beneath such an assailant! Hope nothing from me.\nThou hast not served me; and believing that thou wert avenging me, thou\nhast deprived me of life.\n\n_Don Sancho._ Strange delusion, which, far from listening to me----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Wilt thou that I should listen to thee while boasting of his\ndeath?--that I should patiently hear with what haughty pride thou wilt\ndescribe his misfortune, my own crime, and thy prowess?\n\n\nScene VI.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON SANCHO, DON ALONZO,\nCHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, there is no further need to dissemble that which all my\nstruggles have not been able to conceal from you. I loved, you knew it;\nbut, to avenge my father, I even wished to sacrifice so dear a being [as\nRodrigo]. Sire, your majesty may have seen how I have made love yield to\nduty. At last, Rodrigo is dead; and his death has converted me from an\nunrelenting foe into an afflicted lover. I owed this revenge to him who\ngave me existence; and to my love I now owe these tears. Don Sancho has\ndestroyed me in undertaking my defence; and I am the reward of the arm\nwhich destroys me. Sire, if compassion can influence a king, for mercy's\nsake revoke a law so severe. As the reward of a victory by which I lose\nthat which I love, I leave him my possessions; let him leave me to\nmyself, that in a sacred cloister I may weep continually, even to my\nlast sigh, for my father and my lover.\n\n_Don Diego._ In brief, she loves, sire, and no longer believes it a\ncrime to acknowledge with her own lips a lawful affection.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, be undeceived [_lit._ come out from thine\nerror]; thy lover is not dead, and the vanquished Don Sancho has given\nthee a false report.\n\n_Don Sancho._ Sire, a little too much eagerness, in spite of me, has\nmisled her; I came from the combat to tell her the result. This noble\nwarrior of whom her heart is enamored, when he had disarmed me, spoke to\nme thus: \"Fear nothing--I would rather leave the victory uncertain, than\nshed blood risked in defence of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne; but, since my duty calls me to\nthe King, go, tell her of our combat [on my behalf]; on the part of the\nconqueror, carry her thy sword.\" Sire, I came; this weapon deceived her;\nseeing me return, she believed me to be conqueror, and her resentment\nsuddenly betrayed her love, with such excitement and so much impatience,\nthat I could not obtain a moment's hearing. As for me, although\nconquered, I consider myself fortunate; and in spite of the interests of\nmy enamored heart, [though] losing infinitely, I still love my defeat,\nwhich causes the triumph of a love so perfect.\n\n_Don Fernando._ My daughter, there is no need to blush for a passion so\nglorious, nor to seek means of making a disavowal of it; a laudable\n[sense of] shame in vain solicits thee; thy honor is redeemed, and thy\nduty performed; thy father is satisfied, and it was to avenge him that\nthou didst so often place thy Rodrigo in danger. Thou seest how heaven\notherwise ordains. Having done so much for him [i.e. thy father], do\nsomething for thyself; and be not rebellious against my command, which\ngives thee a spouse beloved so dearly.\n\n\nScene VII.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON RODRIGO, DON\nALONZO, DON SANCHO, THE INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, LEONORA, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Dry thy tears, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and receive without sadness this\nnoble conqueror from the hands of thy princess.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Be not offended, sire, if in your presence an impassioned\nhomage causes me to kneel before her [_lit._ casts me before her knees].\nI come not here to ask for [the reward of] my victory; I come once more\n[_or_, anew] to offer you my head, dear lady. My love shall not employ\nin my own favor either the law of the combat or the will of the King. If\nall that has been done is too little for a father, say by what means you\nmust be satisfied. Must I still contend against a thousand and a\nthousand rivals, and to the two ends of the earth extend my labors,\nmyself alone storm a camp, put to flight an army, surpass the renown of\nfabulous heroes? If my deep offence can be by that means washed away, I\ndare undertake all, and can accomplish all. But if this proud honor,\nalways inexorable, cannot be appeased without the death of the guilty\n[offender], arm no more against me the power of mortals; mine head is at\nthy feet, avenge thyself by thine own hands; thine hands alone have the\nright to vanquish the invincible. Take thou a vengeance to all others\nimpossible. But at least let my death suffice to punish me; banish me\nnot from thy remembrance, and, since my doom preserves your honor, to\nrecompense yourself for this, preserve my memory, and say sometimes,\nwhen deploring my fate: \"Had he not loved me, he would not have died.\"\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Rise, Rodrigo. I must confess it, sire, I have said too much\nto be able to unsay it. Rodrigo has noble qualities which I cannot hate;\nand, when a king commands, he ought to be obeyed. But to whatever [fate]\nyou may have already doomed me, can you, before your eyes, tolerate this\nunion? And when you desire this effort from my feeling of duty, is it\nentirely in accord with your sense of justice? If Rodrigo becomes so\nindispensable to the state, of that which he has done for you ought I to\nbe the reward, and surrender myself to the everlasting reproach of\nhaving imbrued my hands in the blood of a father?\n\n_Don Fernando._ Time has often rendered lawful that which at first\nseemed impossible, without being a crime. Rodrigo has won thee, and thou\nart justly his. But, although his valor has by conquest obtained thee\nto-day, it would need that I should become the enemy of thy\nself-respect, to give him so soon the reward of his victory. This bridal\ndeferred does not break a law, which, without specifying the time,\ndevotes thy faith to him. Take a year, if thou wilt, to dry thy tears;\nRodrigo, in the mean time, must take up arms. After having vanquished\nthe Moors on our borders, overthrown their plans, and repulsed their\nattacks, go, carry the war even into their country, command my army,\nand ravage their territory. At the mere name of Cid they will tremble\nwith dismay. They have named thee lord! they will desire thee as their\nking! But, amidst thy brilliant [_lit._ high] achievements, be thou to\nher always faithful; return, if it be possible, still more worthy of\nher, and by thy great exploits acquire such renown, that it may be\nglorious for her to espouse thee then.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ To gain Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and for your service, what command can\nbe issued to me that mine arm cannot accomplish? Yet, though absent from\nher [dear] eyes, I must suffer grief, sire, I have too much happiness in\nbeing able--to hope!\n\n_Don Fernando._ Hope in thy manly resolution; hope in my promise, and\nalready possessing the heart of thy mistress, let time, thy valor, and\nthy king exert themselves [_lit._ do, or act], to overcome a scrupulous\nfeeling of honor which is contending against thee.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cid, by Pierre Corneille\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CID ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14954-8.txt or 14954-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/9/5/14954/\n\nProduced by David Garcia, Branko Collin and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

      " \"son of Diego\"), a\nCastilian noble by birth. He was born at Burgos about the year 1040.\n\nThere is so much of the mythical in the history of this personage that\nhypercritical writers, such as Masdeu, have doubted his existence; but\nrecent researches have succeeded in separating the historical from the\nromantic.\n\nUnder Sancho II, son of Ferdinand, he served as commander of the royal\ntroops. In a war between the two brothers, Sancho II. and Alfonso VI. of\nLeon, due to some dishonorable stratagem on the part of Rodrigo, Sancho\nwas victorious and his brother was forced to seek refuge with the\nMoorish King of Toledo.\n\nIn 1072 Sancho was assassinated at the siege of Zamora, and as he left\nno heir the Castilians had to acknowledge Alfonso as King. Although\nAlfonso never forgave the Cid for having, as leader of the Castilians,\ncompelled him to swear that he (the Cid) had no hand in the murder of\nhis brother Sancho, as a conciliatory measure, he gave his cousin\nXimena, daughter of the Count of Oviedo,",
      " to the Cid in marriage, but\nafterwards, in 1081, when he found himself firmly seated on the throne,\nyielding to his own feelings of resentment and incited by the Leonese\nnobles, he banished him from the kingdom.\n\nAt the head of a large body of followers, the Cid joined the Moorish\nKing of Saragossa, in whose service he fought against both Moslems and\nChristians. It was probably during this exile that he was first called\nthe Cid, an Arabic title, which means the _lord_. He was very\nsuccessful in all his battles.\n\nIn conjunction with Mostain, grandson of Moctadir, he invaded Valencia\nin 1088, but afterwards carried on operations alone, and finally, after\na long siege, made himself master of the city in June, 1094. He retained\npossession of Valencia for five years and reigned like an independent\nsovereign over one of the richest territories in the Peninsula, but died\nsuddenly in 1099 of anger and grief on hearing that his relative, Alvar\nFa\u00c3\u00b1ez, had been vanquished and the army which he had sent to his\nassistance had been defeated.\n\nAfter the Cid's death his wife held Valencia till 1102,",
      " when she was\nobliged to yield to the Almoravides and fly to Castile, where she died\nin 1104. Her remains were placed by those of her lord in the monastery\nof San Pedro de Carde\u00c3\u00b1a.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CID.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE FIRST.\n\n\nScene I.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira, have you given me a really true report? Do you\nconceal nothing that my father has said?\n\n_Elvira._ All my feelings within me are still delighted with it. He\nesteems Rodrigo as much as you love him; and if I do not misread his\nmind, he will command you to respond to his passion.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Tell me then, I beseech you, a second time, what makes you\nbelieve that he approves of my choice; tell me anew what hope I ought to\nentertain from it. A discourse so charming cannot be too often heard;\nyou cannot too forcibly promise to the fervor of our love the sweet\nliberty of manifesting itself to the light of day. What answer has he\ngiven regarding the secret suit which Don Sancho and Don Rodrigo are\npaying to you?",
      " Have you not too clearly shown the disparity between the\ntwo lovers which inclines me to the one side?\n\n_Elvira._ No; I have depicted your heart as filled with an\nindifference which elates not either of them nor destroys hope, and,\nwithout regarding them with too stern or too gentle an aspect, awaits the\ncommands of a father to choose a spouse. This respect has delighted\nhim--his lips and his countenance gave me at once a worthy testimony of\nit; and, since I must again tell you the tale, this is what he hastened\nto say to me of them and of you: 'She is in the right. Both are worthy\nof her; both are sprung from a noble, valiant, and faithful lineage;\nyoung but yet who show by their mien [_lit._ cause to easily be read\nin their eyes] the brilliant valor of their brave ancestors. Don Rodrigo,\nabove all, has no feature in his face which is not the noble [_lit._\nhigh] representative of a man of courage [_lit._ heart], and descends\nfrom a house so prolific in warriors, that they enter into life [_lit._\ntake birth there] in the midst of laurels. The valor of his father,",
      " in\nhis time without an equal, as long as his strength endured, was\nconsidered a marvel; the furrows on his brow bear witness to [_lit._\nhave engraved his] exploits, and tell us still what he formerly was. I\npredict of the son what I have seen of the father, and my daughter, in\none word, may love him and please me.' He was going to the council, the\nhour for which approaching, cut short this discourse, which he had\nscarcely commenced; but from these few words, I believe that his mind\n[_lit._ thoughts] is not quite decided between your two lovers. The king\nis going to appoint an instructor for his son, and it is he for whom an\nhonor so great is designed. This choice is not doubtful, and his\nunexampled valor cannot tolerate that we should fear any competition. As\nhis high exploits render him without an equal, in a hope so justifiable\nhe will be without a rival; and since Don Rodrigo has persuaded his\nfather, when going out from the council, to propose the affair. I leave\nyou to judge whether he will seize this opportunity [_lit._ whether he\nwill take his time well], and whether all your desires will soon be\n",
      "gratified.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It seems, however, that my agitated soul refuses this joy,\nand finds itself overwhelmed by it. One moment gives to fate different\naspects, and in this great happiness I fear a great reverse.\n\n_Elvira._ You see this fear happily deceived.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Let us go, whatever it may be, to await the issue.\n\n\nScene II.--The INFANTA, LEONORA, and a PAGE.\n\n\n_Infanta (to Page_). Page, go, tell Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne from me, that to-day she is\nrather long in coming to see me, and that my friendship complains of her\ntardiness. [_Exit Page._]\n\n_Leonora._ Dear lady, each day the same desire urges you, and at your\ninterview with her, I see you every day ask her how her love proceeds.\n\n_Infanta._ It is not without reason. I have almost compelled her to\nreceive the arrows with which her soul is wounded. She loves Rodrigo,\nand she holds him from my hand; and by means of me Don Rodrigo has\nconquered her disdain. Thus, having forged the chains of these lovers, I\nought to take an interest in seeing their troubles at an end.\n\n_",
      "Leonora._ Dear lady, however, amidst their good fortune you exhibit a\ngrief which proceeds to excess. Does this love, which fills them both\nwith gladness, produce in this noble heart [of yours] profound sadness?\nAnd does this great interest which you take in them render you unhappy,\nwhilst they are happy? But I proceed too far, and become indiscreet.\n\n_Infanta._ My sadness redoubles in keeping the secret. Listen, listen\nat length, how I have struggled; listen what assaults my constancy\n[_lit._ virtue or valor] yet braves. Love is a tyrant which spares no\none. This young cavalier, this lover which I give [her]--I love him.\n\n_Leonora._ You love him!\n\n_Infanta._ Place your hand upon my heart, and feel [_lit._ see] how it\nthrobs at the name of its conqueror! how it recognizes him!\n\n_Leonora._ Pardon me, dear lady, if I am wanting in respect in blaming\nthis passion; a noble princess to so far forget herself as to admit in\nher heart a simple [_or_, humble] cavalier! And what would the King\nsay?--what would Castile say?",
      " Do you still remember of whom you are the\ndaughter?\n\n_Infanta._ I remember it so well, that I would shed my blood rather than\ndegrade my rank. I might assuredly answer to thee, that, in noble souls,\nworth alone ought to arouse passions; and, if my love sought to excuse\nitself, a thousand famous examples might sanction it. But I will not\nfollow these--where my honor is concerned, the captivation of my\nfeelings does not abate my courage, and I say to myself always, that,\nbeing the daughter of a king, all other than a monarch is unworthy of\nme. When I saw that my heart could not protect itself, I myself gave\naway that which I did not dare to take; and I put, in place of my self,\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne in its fetters, and I kindled their passions [_lit._ fires] in\norder to extinguish my own. Be then no longer surprised if my troubled\nsoul with impatience awaits their bridal; thou seest that my happiness\n[_lit._ repose] this day depends upon it. If love lives by hope, it\nperishes with it; it is a fire which becomes extinguished for want of\n",
      "fuel; and, in spite of the severity of my sad lot, if Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne ever has\nRodrigo for a husband, my hope is dead and my spirit, is healed.\nMeanwhile, I endure an incredible torture; even up to this bridal.\nRodrigo is dear to me; I strive to lose him, and I lose him with regret,\nand hence my secret anxiety derives its origin. I see with sorrow that\nlove compels me to utter sighs for that [object] which [as a princess] I\nmust disdain. I feel my spirit divided into two portions; if my courage\nis high, my heart is inflamed [with love]. This bridal is fatal to me, I\nfear it, and [yet] I desire it; I dare to hope from it only an\nincomplete joy; my honor and my love have for me such attractions, that\nI [shall] die whether it be accomplished, or whether it be not\naccomplished.\n\n_Leonora._ Dear lady, after that I have nothing more to say, except\nthat, with you, I sigh for your misfortunes; I blamed you a short time\nsince, now I pity you. But since in a misfortune [i.e.",
      " an ill-timed\nlove] so sweet and so painful, your noble spirit [_lit._ virtue]\ncontends against both its charm and its strength, and repulses its\nassault and regrets its allurements, it will restore calmness to your\nagitated feelings. Hope then every [good result] from it, and from the\nassistance of time; hope everything from heaven; it is too just [_lit._\nit has too much justice] to leave virtue in such a long continued\ntorture.\n\n_Infanta._ My sweetest hope is to lose hope.\n\n(_The Page re-enters._)\n\n_Page._ By your commands, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne comes to see you.\n\n_Infanta_ (to _Leonora_). Go and converse with her in that gallery\n[yonder].\n\n_Leonora._ Do you wish to continue in dreamland?\n\n_Infanta._ No, I wish, only, in spite of my grief, to compose myself\n[_lit._ to put my features a little more at leisure]. I follow you.\n\n[_Leonora goes out along with the Page._]\n\n\nScene III.--The INFANTA (alone).\n\n\nJust heaven, from which I await my relief, put, at last, some limit to\nthe misfortune which is overcoming [_lit._ possesses]",
      " me; secure my\nrepose, secure my honor. In the happiness of others I seek my own. This\nbridal is equally important to three [parties]; render its completion\nmore prompt, or my soul more enduring. To unite these two lovers with a\nmarriage-tie is to break all my chains and to end all my sorrows. But I\ntarry a little too long; let us go to meet Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and, by\nconversation, to relieve our grief.\n\n\nScene IV.--COUNT DE GORMAS and DON DIEGO (meeting).\n\n\n_Count._ At last you have gained it [_or_, prevailed], and the favor of\na King raises you to a rank which was due only to myself; he makes you\nGovernor of the Prince of Castile.\n\n_Don Diego._ This mark of distinction with which he distinguishes\n[_lit._ which he puts into] my family shows to all that he is just, and\ncauses it to be sufficiently understood, that he knows how to recompense\nbygone services.\n\n_Count._ However great kings may be, they are only men [_lit._ they are\nthat which we are]; they can make mistakes like other men, and this\nchoice serves as a proof to all courtiers that they know how to [_or_,\ncan]",
      " badly recompense present services.\n\n_Don Diego._ Let us speak no more of a choice at which your mind\nbecomes exasperated. Favor may have been able to do as much as merit;\nbut we owe this respect to absolute power, to question nothing when a\nking has wished it. To the honor which he has done me add another--let\nus join by a sacred tie my house to yours. You have an only daughter,\nand I have an only son; their marriage may render us for ever more than\nfriends. Grant us this favor, and accept, him as a son-in-law.\n\n_Count._ To higher alliances this precious son ought [_or_, is likely]\nto aspire; and the new splendor of your dignity ought to inflate his\nheart with another [higher] vanity. Exercise that [dignity], sir, and\ninstruct the prince. Show him how it is necessary to rule a province: to\nmake the people tremble everywhere under his law; to fill the good with\nlove, and the wicked with terror. Add to these virtues those of a\ncommander: show him how it is necessary to inure himself to fatigue; in\nthe profession of a warrior [_lit._ of Mars] to render himself without\n",
      "an equal; to pass entire days and nights on horseback; to sleep\nall-armed: to storm a rampart, and to owe to himself alone the winning\nof a battle. Instruct him by example, and render him perfect, bringing\nyour lessons to his notice by carrying them into effect.\n\n_Don Diego._ To instruct himself by example, in spite of your jealous\nfeelings, he shall read only the history of my life. There, in a long\nsuccession of glorious deeds, he shall see how nations ought to be\nsubdued; to attack a fortress, to marshal an army, and on great exploits\nto build his renown.\n\n_Count._ Living examples have a greater [_lit._ another] power. A\nprince, in a book, learns his duty but badly [_or_, imperfectly]; and\nwhat, after all, has this great number of years done which one of my\ndays cannot equal? If you have been valiant, I am so to-day, and this\narm is the strongest support of the kingdom. Granada and Arragon tremble\nwhen this sword flashes; my name serves as a rampart to all Castile;\nwithout me you would soon pass under other laws, and you would soon have\n",
      "your enemies as [_lit._ for] kings. Each day, each moment, to increase\nmy glory, adds laurels to laurels, victory to victory. The prince, by my\nside, would make the trial of his courage in the wars under the shadow\nof my arm; he would learn to conquer by seeing me do so; and, to prove\nspeedily worthy of his high character, he would see----\n\n_Don Diego._ I know it; you serve the king well. I have seen you fight\nand command under me, when [old] age has caused its freezing currents to\nflow within my nerves [i.e. \"when the frosts of old age had numbed my\nnerves\"--_Jules Bue_], your unexampled [_lit._ rare] valor has worthily\n[_lit._ well] supplied my place; in fine, to spare unnecessary words,\nyou are to-day what I used to be. You see, nevertheless, that in this\nrivalry a monarch places some distinction between us.\n\n_Count._ That prize which I deserved you have carried off.\n\n_Don Diego._ He who has gained that [advantage] over you has deserved it\nbest.\n\n_Count._ He who can use it to the best advantage is the most worthy of\n",
      "it.\n\n_Don Diego._ To be refused that prize [_lit._ it] is not a good sign.\n\n_Count._ You have gained it by intrigue, being an old courtier.\n\n_Don Diego._ The brilliancy of my noble deeds was my only recommendation\n[_lit._ support].\n\n_Count._ Let us speak better of it [i.e. more plainly]: the king does\nhonor to your age.\n\n_Don Diego._ The king, when he does it [i.e. that honor], gives it\n[_lit._ measures it] to courage.\n\n_Count._ And for that reason this honor was due only to me [_lit._ my\narm].\n\n_Don Diego._ He who has not been able to obtain it did not deserve it.\n\n_Count._ Did not deserve it? I!\n\n_Don Diego._ You.\n\n_Count._ Thy impudence, rash old man, shall have its recompense. [_He\ngives him a slap on the face._] _Don Diego (drawing his sword [_lit._\nputting the sword in his hand_]). Finish [this outrage], and take my\nlife after such an insult, the first for which my race has ever had\ncause to blush [_lit._ has seen its brow grow red].\n\n_Count._ And what do you think you can do,",
      " weak us you are [_lit._ with\nsuch feebleness]?\n\n_Don Diego._ Oh, heaven! my exhausted strength fails me in this\nnecessity!\n\n_Count._ Thy sword is mine; but thou wouldst be too vain if this\ndiscreditable trophy had laden my hand [i.e. if I had carried away a\ntrophy so discreditable]. Farewell--adieu! Cause the prince to read, in\nspite of jealous feelings, for his instruction, the history of thy life.\nThis just punishment of impertinent language will serve as no small\nembellishment for it.\n\n\nScene V.--DON DIEGO.\n\n\nO rage! O despair! O inimical old age! Have I then lived so long only\nfor this disgrace? And have I grown grey in warlike toils, only to see\nin one day so many of my laurels wither? Does my arm [i.e. my valor],\nwhich all Spain admires and looks up to [_lit._ with respect]--[does] my\narm, which has so often saved this empire, and so often strengthened\nanew the throne of its king, now [_lit._ then] betray my cause, and do\nnothing for me?",
      " O cruel remembrance of my bygone glory! O work of a\nlifetime [_lit._ so many days] effaced in a day! new dignity fatal to my\nhappiness! lofty precipice from which mine honor falls! must I see the\ncount triumph over your splendor, and die without vengeance, or live in\nshame? Count, be now the instructor of my prince! This high rank becomes\n[_lit._ admits] no man without honor, and thy jealous pride, by this\nfoul [_lit._ remarkable] insult, in spite of the choice of the king, has\ncontrived [_lit._ has known how] to render me unworthy of it. And thou,\nglorious instrument of my exploits, but yet a useless ornament of an\nenfeebled body numbed by age [_lit._ all of ice], thou sword, hitherto\nto be feared, and which in this insult has served me for show, and not\nfor defence, go, abandon henceforth the most dishonored [_lit._ the\nlast] of his race; pass, to avenge me, into better hands!\n\n\nScene VI.--DON DIEGO and DON RODRIGO.\n\n\n_Don Diego._ Rodrigo, hast thou courage [_lit._ a heart]",
      "?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Any other than my father would have found that out\ninstantly.\n\n_Don Diego._ Welcome wrath! worthy resentment, most pleasing to my\ngrief! I recognize my blood in this noble rage; my youth revives in this\nardor so prompt. Come, my son, come, my blood, come to retrieve my\nshame--come to avenge me!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Of what?\n\n_Don Diego._ Of an insult so cruel that it deals a deadly stroke\nagainst the honor of us both--of a blow! The insolent [man] would have\nlost his life for it, but my age deceived my noble ambition; and this\nsword, which my arm can no longer wield, I give up to thine, to avenge\nand punish. Go against this presumptuous man, and prove thy valor: it is\nonly in blood that one can wash away such an insult; die or slay.\nMoreover, not to deceive thee, I give thee to fight a formidable\nantagonist [_lit._ a man to be feared], I have seen him entirely covered\nwith blood and dust, carrying everywhere dismay through an entire army.\nI have seen by his valor a hundred squadrons broken;",
      " and, to tell thee\nstill something more--more than brave soldier, more than great leader,\nhe is----\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Pray, finish.\n\n_Don Diego._ The father of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ The----\n\n_Don Diego._ Do not reply; I know thy love. But he who lives dishonored\nis unworthy of life; the dearer the offender the greater the offence. In\nshort, thou knowest the insult, and thou holdest [in thy grasp the means\nof] vengeance. I say no more to thee. Avenge me, avenge thyself! Show\nthyself a son worthy of a father such as I [am]. Overwhelmed by\nmisfortunes to which destiny reduces me, I go to deplore them. Go, run,\nfly, and avenge us!\n\n\nScene VII.--DON RODRIGO.\n\n\nPierced even to the depth [_or,_ bottom of the heart] by a blow\nunexpected as well as deadly, pitiable avenger of a just quarrel and\nunfortunate object of an unjust severity, I remain motionless, and my\ndejected soul yields to the blow which is slaying me. So near seeing my\nlove requited!",
      " O heaven, the strange pang [_or,_ difficulty]! In this\ninsult my father is the person aggrieved, and the aggressor is the\nfather of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne!\n\nWhat fierce conflicts [of feelings] I experience! My love is engaged\n[_lit._ interests itself] against my own honor. I must avenge a father\nand lose a mistress. The one stimulates my courage, the other restrains\nmy arm. Reduced to the sad choice of either betraying my love or of\nliving as a degraded [man], on both sides my situation is wretched\n[_lit._ evil is infinite]. O heaven, the strange pang [_or,_\ndifficulty]! Must I leave an insult unavenged? Must I punish the father\nof Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne?\n\nFather, mistress, honor, love--noble and severe restraint--a bondage\nstill to be beloved [_lit._ beloved tyranny], all my pleasures are dead,\nor my glory is sullied. The one renders me unhappy; the other unworthy\nof life. Dear and cruel hope of a soul noble but still enamored, worthy\nenemy of my greatest happiness, thou sword which causest my painful\nanxiety, hast thou been given to me to avenge my honor?",
      " Hast thou been\ngiven to me to lose Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne?\n\nIt is better to rush [_lit._ run] to death. I owe [a duty] to my\nmistress as well as to my father. I draw, in avenging myself, her hatred\nand her rage; I draw upon myself his [i.e. my father's] contempt by\nnot avenging myself. To my sweetest hope the one [alternative] renders\nme unfaithful, and the other [alternative] renders me unworthy of her.\nMy misfortune increases by seeking a remedy [_lit._ by wishing to cure\nit]. All [supposed reliefs] redoubles my woes. Come then, my soul [or,\nbeloved sword], and, since I must die, let us die, at least, without\noffending Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne!\n\nTo die without obtaining satisfaction! To seek a death so fatal to my\nfame! To endure that Spain should impute to my memory [the fact] of\nhaving badly maintained the honor of my house! To respect a love of\nwhich my distracted soul already sees the certain loss. Let us no more\nlisten to this insidious thought, which serves only to pain me [_or,",
      "_\ncontributes only to my painful position]. Come, mine arm [_or,_ sword],\nlet us save honor, at least, since, after all, we must lose Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\nYes, my spirit was deceived. I owe all to my father before my mistress.\n\nWhether I die in the combat or die of sadness, I shall yield up my blood\npure as I have received it. I already accuse myself of too much\nnegligence; let us haste to vengeance; and quite ashamed of having\nwavered so much, let us no more be in painful suspense, since to-day my\nfather has been insulted, even though the offender is the father of\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE SECOND.\n\n\nScene I.--COUNT DE GORMAS and DON ARIAS.\n\n\n_Count._ I acknowledge, between ourselves, [that] my blood, a little too\nwarm, became too excited at an expression, and has carried the matter\ntoo far [_lit._ too high], but, since it is done, the deed is without\nremedy.\n\n_Don Arias._ To the wishes of the King let this proud spirit yield; he\ntakes this much to heart, and his exasperated feelings [_lit._ heart]\nwill act against you with full authority.",
      " And, indeed, you have no\navailable defence. The [high] rank of the person offended, the greatness\nof the offence, demand duties and submissions which require more than\nordinary reparation.\n\n_Count._ The King can, at his pleasure, dispose of my life.\n\n_Don Arias._ Your fault is followed by too much excitement. The King\nstill loves you; appease his wrath. He has said, \"I desire it!\"--will\nyou disobey?\n\n_Count._ Sir, to preserve all that esteem which I retain [_or,_ (other\nreading), to preserve my glory and my esteem] to disobey in a slight\ndegree is not so great a crime, and, however great that [offence] may\nbe, my immediate services are more than sufficient to cancel it.\n\n_Don Arias._ Although one perform glorious and important deeds, a King\nis never beholden to his subject. You flatter yourself much, and you\nought to know that he who serves his King well only does his duty. You\nwill ruin yourself, sir, by this confidence.\n\n_Count._ I shall not believe you until I have experience of it [_lit._\nuntil after experience of it].\n\n_Don Arias._ You ought to dread the power of a King.\n\n_Count._ One day alone does not destroy a man such as I.",
      " Let all his\ngreatness arm itself for my punishment; all the state shall perish, if I\nmust perish.\n\n_Don Arias._ What! do you fear so little sovereign power----?\n\n_Count._ [The sovereign power] of a sceptre which, without me, would\nfall from his hand. He himself has too much interest in my person, and\nmy head in falling would cause his crown to fall.\n\n_Don Arias._ Permit reason to bring back your senses. Take good advice.\n\n_Count_. The advice [_or,_ counsel] with regard to it is [already]\ntaken.\n\n_Don Arias._ What shall I say, after all? I am obliged to give him an\naccount [of this interview].\n\n_Count._ [Say] that I can never consent to my own dishonor.\n\n_Don Arias._ But think that kings will be absolute.\n\n_Count._ The die is cast, sir. Let us speak of the matter no more.\n\n_Don Arias._ Adieu, then, sir, since in vain I try to persuade you.\nNotwithstanding [_lit._ with] all your laurels, still dread the\nthunderbolt.\n\n_Count._ I shall await it without fear.\n\n_Don Arias._ But not without effect.\n\n_Count._ We shall see by that Don Diego satisfied.",
      " [_Exit Don Arias.]\n[Alone]_ He who fears not death fears not threats. I have a heart\nsuperior to the greatest misfortunes [_lit._ above the proudest\nmisfortunes]; and men may reduce me to live without happiness, but they\ncannot compel me to live without honor.\n\n\nScene II.--The COUNT and DON RODRIGO.\n\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Here, count, a word or two.\n\n_Count._ Speak.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Relieve me from a doubt. Dost thou know Don Diego well?\n\n_Count._ Yes.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let us speak [in] low [tones]; listen. Dost thou know\nthat this old man was the very [essence of] virtue, valor, and honor in\nhis time? Dost thou know it?\n\n_Count._ Perhaps so.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ This fire which I carry in mine eyes, knowest thou that\nthis is his blood? Dost thou know it?\n\n_Count._ What matters it to me?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Four paces hence I shall cause thee to know it.\n\n_Count._ Presumptuous youth!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Speak without exciting thyself. I am young, it is true;\nbut in souls nobly born valor does not depend upon age [_lit._ wait for\n",
      "the number of years].\n\n_Count._ To measure thyself with me! Who [_or_, what] has rendered thee\nso presumptuous--thou, whom men have never seen with a sword [_lit._\narms] in thine hand?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Men like me do not cause themselves to be known at a\nsecond trial, and they wish [to perform] masterly strokes for their\nfirst attempt.\n\n_Count._ Dost thou know well who I am?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Yes! Any other man except myself, at the mere mention of\nthy name, might tremble with terror. The laurels with which I see thine\nhead so covered seem to bear written [upon them] the prediction of my\nfall. I attack, like a rash man, an arm always victorious; but by\ncourage I shall overcome you [_lit._ I shall have too much strength in\npossessing sufficient courage]. To him who avenges his father nothing is\nimpossible. Thine arm is unconquered, but not invincible.\n\n_Count._ This noble courage which appears in the language you hold has\nshown itself each day by your eyes; and, believing that I saw in you the\nhonor of Castile, my soul with pleasure was destining for you my\n",
      "daughter. I know thy passion, and I am delighted to see that all its\nimpulses yield to thy duty; that they have not weakened this magnanimous\nardor; that thy proud manliness merits my esteem; and that, desiring as\na son-in-law an accomplished cavalier, I was not deceived in the choice\nwhich I had made. But I feel that for thee my compassion is touched. I\nadmire thy courage, and I pity thy youth. Seek not to make thy first\nattempt [_or_, maiden-stroke] fatal. Release my valor from an unequal\nconflict; too little honor for me would attend this victory. In\nconquering without danger we triumph without glory. Men would always\nbelieve that thou wert overpowered without an effort, and I should have\nonly regret for thy death.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Thy presumption is followed by a despicable [_lit._\nunworthy] pity! The man who dares to deprive me of honor, fears to\ndeprive me of life!\n\n_Count._ Withdraw from this place.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let us proceed without further parley.\n\n_Count._ Art thou so tired of life?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Hast thou such a dread of death?\n\n_Count._ Come,",
      " thou art doing thy duty, and the son becomes degenerate\nwho survives for one instant the honor of his father.\n\n\nScene III.--The INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and LEONORA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Soothe, my Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, soothe thy grief; summon up thy firmness\nin this sudden misfortune. Thou shalt see a calm again after this\nshort-lived [_lit._ feeble] storm. Thy happiness is overcast [_lit._\ncovered] only by a slight cloud, and thou hast lost nothing in seeing it\n[i.e. thine happiness] delayed.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ My heart, overwhelmed with sorrows, dares to hope for\nnothing; a storm so sudden, which agitates a calm at sea, conveys to us\na threat of an inevitable [_lit._ certain] shipwreck. I cannot doubt it:\nI am being shipwrecked [_lit._ I am perishing], even in harbor. I was\nloving, I was beloved, and our fathers were consenting [_lit._ in\nharmony], and I was recounting to you the delightful intelligence of\nthis at the fatal moment when this quarrel originated, the fatal recital\nof which,",
      " as soon as it has been given to you, has ruined the effect of\nsuch a dear [_lit._ sweet] expectation. Accursed ambition! hateful\nmadness! whose tyranny the most generous souls are suffering. O [sense\nof] honor!-merciless to my dearest desires, how many tears and sighs art\nthou going to cost me?\n\n_Infanta._ Thou hast, in their quarrel, no reason to be alarmed; one\nmoment has created it, one moment will extinguish it. It has made too\nmuch noise not to be settled amicably, since already the king wishes to\nreconcile them; and thou knowest that my zeal [_lit._ soul], keenly\nalive to thy sorrows, will do its utmost [_lit._ impossibilities] to dry\nup their source.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Reconciliations are not effected in such a feud [_or_, in\nthis manner]; such deadly insults are not [easily] repaired; in vain one\nuses [_lit._ causes to act] force or prudence. If the evil be cured, it\nis [cured] only in appearance; the hatred which hearts preserve within\nfeeds fires hidden, but so much the more ardent.\n\n_",
      "Infanta._ The sacred tie which will unite Don Rodrigo and Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne will\ndispel the hatred of their hostile sires, and we shall soon see the\nstronger [feeling], love, by a happy bridal, extinguish this discord.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I desire it may be so, more than I expect it. Don Diego is\ntoo proud, and I know my father. I feel tears flow, which I wish to\nrestrain; the past afflicts me, and I fear the future.\n\n_Infanta._ What dost thou fear? Is it the impotent weakness of an old\nman?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Rodrigo has courage.\n\n_Infanta._ He is too young.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Courageous men become so [i.e. courageous] at once.\n\n_Infanta._ You ought not, however, to dread him much. He is too much\nenamored to wish to displease you, and two words from thy lips would\narrest his rage.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If he does not obey me, what a consummation of my sorrow!\nAnd, if he can obey me, what will men say of him? being of such noble\nbirth,",
      " to endure such an insult! Whether he yields to, or resists the\npassion which binds him to me, my mind can not be otherwise than either\nashamed of his too great deference, or shocked at a just refusal.\n\n_Infanta._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne has a proud soul, and, though deeply interested, she\ncannot endure one base [_lit._  low] thought. But, if up to the day of\nreconciliation I make this model lover my prisoner, and I thus prevent\nthe effect of his courage, will thine enamored soul take no umbrage at\nit?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! dear lady, in that case I have no more anxiety.\n\n\nScene IV.--The INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, LEONORA, and a PAGE.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Page, seek Rodrigo, and bring him hither.\n\n_Page._ The Count de Gormas and he----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Good heavens! I tremble!\n\n_Infanta._ Speak.\n\n_Page._ From this palace have gone out together.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Alone?\n\n_Page._ Alone, and they seemed in low tones to be wrangling with each\nother.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Without doubt they are fighting;",

[_Exeunt Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne\nand Page._]\n\n\nScene V.--The INFANTA and LEONORA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Alas! what uneasiness I feel in my mind! I weep for her\nsorrows, [yet still] her lover enthralls me; my calmness forsakes me,\nand my passion revives. That which is going to separate Rodrigo from\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne rekindles at once my hope and my pain; and their separation,\nwhich I see with regret, infuses a secret pleasure in mine enamored\nsoul.\n\n_Leonora._ This noble pride which reigns in your soul, does it so soon\nsurrender to this unworthy passion?\n\n_Infanta._ Call it not unworthy, since, seated in my heart, proud and\ntriumphant, it asserts its sway [_lit._ law] over me. Treat it with\nrespect, since it is so dear to me. My pride struggles against it, but,\nin spite of myself--I hope; and my heart, imperfectly shielded against\nsuch a vain expectation, flies after a lover whom Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne has lost.\n\n_",
      "Leonora._ Do you thus let this noble resolution give way [_lit._ fall]?\nAnd does reason in your mind thus lose its influence?\n\n_Infanta._ Ah! with how little effect do we listen to reason when the\nheart is assailed by a poison so delicious, and when the sick man loves\nhis malady! We can hardly endure that any remedy should be applied to\nit.\n\n_Leonora._ Your hope beguiles you, your malady is pleasant to you; but,\nin fact, this Rodrigo is unworthy of you.\n\n_Infanta._ I know it only too well; but if my pride yields, learn how\nlove flatters a heart which it possesses. If Rodrigo once [_or_, only]\ncomes forth from the combat as a conqueror, if this great warrior falls\nbeneath his valor, I may consider him worthy of me, and I may love him\nwithout shame. What may he not do, if he can conquer the Count? I dare\nto imagine that, as the least of his exploits, entire kingdoms will fall\nbeneath his laws; and my fond love is already persuaded that I behold\nhim seated on the throne of Granada, the vanquished Moors trembling\nwhile paying him homage;",
      " Arragon receiving this new conqueror, Portugal\nsurrendering, and his victorious battles [_lit._ noble days] advancing\nhis proud destinies beyond the seas, laving his laurels with the blood\nof Africans! In fine, all that is told of the most distinguished\nwarriors I expect from Rodrigo after this victory, and I make my love\nfor him the theme of my glory.\n\n_Leonora._ But, madam, see how far you carry his exploits [_lit._ arm]\nin consequence of a combat which, perhaps, has no reality!\n\n_Infanta._ Rodrigo has been insulted; the Count has committed the\noutrage; they have gone out together. Is there need of more?\n\n_Leonora._ Ah, well! they will fight, since you will have it so; but\nwill Rodrigo go so far as you are going?\n\n_Infanta._ Bear with me [_lit._ what do you mean]? I am mad, and my mind\nwanders; thou seest by that what evils this love prepares for me. Come\ninto my private apartment to console my anxieties, and do not desert me\nin the trouble I am in [at present].\n\n\nScene VI.--DON FERNANDO (the King), DON ARIAS,",
      " DON SANCHO, and DON\nALONZO.\n\n\n_Don Fernando._ The Count is, then, so presumptuous and so little\naccessible to reason? Does he still dare to believe his offence\npardonable?\n\n_Don Arias._ Sire, in your name I have long conversed with him. I have\ndone my utmost, and I have obtained nothing.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Just heavens! Thus, then, a rash subject has so little\nrespect and anxiety to please me! He insults Don Diego, and despises his\nKing! He gives laws to me in the midst of my court! Brave warrior\nthough he be, great general though he be, I am well able [_lit._ I shall\nknow well how] to tame such a haughty spirit! Were he incarnate valor\n[_lit._ valor itself], and the god of combats, he shall see what it is\nnot to obey! Whatever punishment such insolence may have deserved, I\nwished at first to treat it [_or,_ him] without violence; but, since he\nabuses my leniency, go instantly [_lit._ this very day], and, whether he\nresists or not, secure his person. [_Exit Don Alonzo._]\n\n_Don Sancho._ Perhaps a little time will render him less rebellious;\nthey came upon him still boiling with rage,",
      " on account of his quarrel.\nSire, in the heat of a first impulse, so noble a heart yields with\ndifficulty. He sees that he has done wrong, but a soul so lofty is not\nso soon induced to acknowledge its fault.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Don Sancho, be silent; and be warned that he who takes\nhis part renders himself criminal.\n\n_Don Sancho._ I obey, and am silent; but in pity, sire, [permit] two\nwords in his defence.\n\n_Don Fernando._ And what can you say?\n\n_Don Sancho._ That a soul accustomed to noble actions cannot lower\nitself to apologies. It does not imagine any which can be expressed\nwithout _shame;_ and it is that word alone that the Count resists. He\nfinds in his duty a little too much severity, and he would obey you if\nhe had less heart. Command that his arm, trained in war's dangers,\nrepair this injury at the point of the sword: he will give satisfaction,\nsire; and, come what may, until he has been made aware of your decision,\nhere am I to answer for him.\n\n_Don Fernando._ You fail [_lit._ you are losing] in respect; but I\n",
      "pardon youth, and I excuse enthusiasm in a young, courageous heart. A\nking, whose prudence has better objects in view [than such quarrels],\nis more sparing of the blood of his subjects. I watch over mine; my\n[watchful] care protects them, as the head takes care of the limbs which\nserve it. Thus your reasoning is not reasoning for me. You speak as a\nsoldier--I must act as a king; and whatever others may wish to say, or\nhe may presume to think, the Count will not part with [_lit._ cannot\nlose] his glory by obeying me. Besides, the insult affects myself: he\nhas dishonored him whom I have made the instructor of my son. To impugn\nmy choice is to challenge me, and to make an attempt upon the supreme\npower. Let us speak of it no more. And now, ten vessels of our old\nenemies have been seen to hoist their flags; near the mouth of the river\nthey have dared to appear.\n\n_Don Arias._ The Moors have by force [of arms] learned to know you, and,\nso often vanquished, they have lost heart to risk their lives [_lit._\nthemselves]",
      " any more against so great a conqueror.\n\n_Don Fernando._ They will never, without a certain amount of jealousy,\nbehold my sceptre, in spite of them, ruling over Andalusia; and this\ncountry, so beautiful, which they too long enjoyed, is always regarded\nby them with an envious eye. This is the sole reason which has caused\nus, for the last ten years, to place the Castilian throne in Seville, in\norder to watch them more closely, and, by more prompt action,\nimmediately to overthrow whatever [design] they might undertake.\n\n_Don Arias._ They know, at the cost of their noblest leaders [_lit._\nmost worthy heads], how much your presence secures your conquests; you\nhave nothing to fear.\n\n_Don Fernando._ And nothing to neglect--too much confidence brings on\ndanger; and you are not ignorant that, with very little difficulty, the\nrising tide brings them hither. However, I should be wrong to cause a\npanic in the hearts [of the citizens], the news being uncertain. The\ndismay which this useless alarm might produce in the night, which is\napproaching, might agitate the town too much. Cause the guards to be\n",

Don Diego, by his son, has\navenged his wrong.\n\n_Don Fernando._ As soon as I knew of the insult I foresaw the vengeance,\nand from that moment I wished to avert this misfortune.\n\n_Don Alonzo._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne approaches to lay her grief at your feet [_lit._\nbrings to your knees her grief]; she comes all in tears to sue for\njustice from you.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Much though my soul compassionates her sorrows, what the\nCount has done seems to have deserved this just punishment of his\nrashness. Yet, however just his penalty may be, I cannot lose such a\nwarrior without regret. After long service rendered to my state, after\nhis blood has been shed for me a thousand times, to whatever thoughts\nhis [stubborn] pride compels me, his loss enfeebles me, and his death\nafflicts me.\n\n\nScene VIII.--DON FERNANDO,",

Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, I\nsympathize with your sorrow; with an equal grief I feel my own soul\nafflicted. (_To Don Diego._) You shall speak afterwards; do not\ninterrupt her complaint.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, my father is dead! My eyes have seen his blood gush\nforth from his noble breast--that blood which has so often secured your\n",
      "walls--that blood which has so often won your battles--that blood which,\nthough all outpoured, still fumes with rage at seeing itself shed for\nany other than for you! Rodrigo, before your very palace, has just dyed\n[_lit._ covered] the earth with that [blood] which in the midst of\ndangers war did not dare to shed! Faint and pallid, I ran to the spot,\nand I found him bereft of life. Pardon my grief, sire, but my voice\nfails me at this terrible recital; my tears and my sighs will better\ntell you the rest!\n\n_Don Fernando._ Take courage, my daughter, and know that from to-day thy\nking will serve thee as a father instead of him.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, my anguish is attended with too much [unavailing]\nhorror! I found him, I have already said, bereft of life; his breast was\npierced [_lit._ open], and his blood upon the [surrounding] dust\ndictated [_lit._ wrote] my duty; or rather his valor, reduced to this\ncondition, spoke to me through his wound, and urged me to claim redress;\nand to make itself heard by the most just of kings,",
      " by these sad lips,\nit borrowed my voice. Sire, do not permit that, under your sway, such\nlicense should reign before your [very] eyes; that the most valiant with\nimpunity should be exposed to the thrusts of rashness; that a\npresumptuous youth should triumph over their glory, should imbrue\nhimself with their blood, and scoff at their memory! If the valiant\nwarrior who has just been torn from you be not avenged, the ardor for\nserving you becomes extinguished. In fine, my father is dead, and I\ndemand vengeance more for your interest than for my consolation. You are\na loser in the death of a man of his position. Avenge it by another's,\nand [have] blood for blood! Sacrifice [the victim] not to me, but to\nyour crown, to your greatness, to yourself! Sacrifice, I say, sire, to\nthe good of the state, all those whom such a daring deed would inflate\nwith pride.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Don Diego, reply.\n\n_Don Diego._ How worthy of envy is he who, in losing [life's] vigor,\nloses life also! And how a long life brings to nobly minded men,",
      " at the\nclose of their career, an unhappy destiny! I, whose long labors have\ngained such great renown--I, whom hitherto everywhere victory has\nfollowed--I see myself to-day, in consequence of having lived too long,\nreceiving an insult, and living vanquished. That which never battle,\nsiege, or ambuscade could [do]--that which Arragon or Granada never\ncould [effect], nor all your enemies, nor all my jealous [rivals], the\nCount has done in your palace, almost before your eyes, [being] jealous\nof your choice, and proud of the advantage which the impotence of age\ngave him over me. Sire, thus these hairs, grown grey in harness [i.e.\ntoils of war]--this blood, so often shed to serve you--this arm,\nformerly the terror of a hostile army, would have sunk into the grave,\nburdened with disgrace, if I had not begotten a son worthy of me, worthy\nof his country, and worthy of his king! He has lent me his hand--he has\nslain the Count--he has restored my honor--he has washed away my shame!\nIf the displaying of courage and resentment,",
      " if the avenging of a blow\ndeserves chastisement, upon me alone should fall the fury of the storm.\nWhen the arm has failed, the head is punished for it. Whether men call\nthis a crime or not requires no discussion. Sire, I am the head, he is\nthe arm only. If Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne complains that he has slain her father, he\nnever would have done that [deed] if I could have done it [myself].\nSacrifice, then, this head, which years will soon remove, and preserve\nfor yourself the arm which can serve you. At the cost of my blood\nsatisfy Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne. I do not resist--I consent to my penalty, and, far from\nmurmuring at a rigorous decree, dying without dishonor, I shall die\nwithout regret.\n\n_Don Fernando._ The matter is of importance, and, calmly considered, it\ndeserves to be debated in full council. Don Sancho, re-conduct Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne\nto her abode. Don Diego shall have my palace and his word of honor as a\nprison. Bring his son here to me.

What! dost\nthou come even here to defy the shade of the Count? Hast thou not slain\nhim?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ His existence was my shame; my honor required this deed\nfrom my [reluctant] hand.\n\n_Elvira._ But to seek thy asylum in the house of the dead! Has ever a\nmurderer made such his refuge?\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ And I come here only to yield myself to my judge. Look no\nmore on me with astonishment [_lit._ an eye amazed]; I seek death after\nhaving inflicted it.",
      " My love is my judge; my judge is my Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne. I\ndeserve death for deserving her hatred, and I am come to receive, as a\nsupreme blessing, its decree from her lips, and its stroke from her\nhand.\n\n_Elvira._ Fly rather from her sight, fly from her impetuosity; conceal\nyour presence from her first excitement. Go! do not expose yourself to\nthe first impulses which the fiery indignation of her resentment may\ngive vent to.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ No, no. This beloved one, whom I [could] so displease,\ncannot have too wrathful a desire for my punishment; and I avoid a\nhundred deaths which are going to crush me if, by dying sooner, I can\nredouble it [i.e. that wrath].\n\n_Elvira._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne is at the palace, bathed in tears, and will return but\ntoo well accompanied. Rodrigo, fly! for mercy's sake relieve me from my\nuneasiness! What might not people say if they saw you here? Do you wish\nthat some slanderer, to crown her misery, should accuse her of\ntolerating here the slayer of her father? She will return;",
      " she is\ncoming--I see her; at least, for the sake of _her_ honor, Rodrigo,\nconceal thyself!

But, if I may be\ncapable of serving you, employ my sword to punish the guilty [one],\nemploy my love to revenge this death; under your commands my arm will be\n[only] too strong.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Unhappy that I am!\n\n_Don Sancho._ I implore you, accept my services.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I should offend the King, who has promised me justice.\n\n_Don Sancho._ You know that justice [_lit._ it] proceeds with such\nslowness, that very often crime escapes in consequence of its delay, its\nslow and doubtful course causes us to lose too many tears.",
      " Permit that a\ncavalier may avenge you by [force of] arms; that method is more certain\nand more prompt in punishing.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It is the last remedy; and if it is necessary to have\nrecourse to it, and your pity for my misfortunes still continues, you\nshall then be free to avenge my injury.\n\n_Don Sancho._ It is the sole happiness to which my soul aspires; and,\nbeing able to hope for it, I depart too well contented.\n\n\nScene III.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ At last I see myself free, and I can, without constraint,\nshow thee the extent of my keen sorrows; I can give vent to my sad\nsighs; I can unbosom to thee my soul and all my griefs. My father is\ndead, Elvira; and the first sword with which Rodrigo armed himself has\ncut his thread of life. Weep, weep, mine eyes, and dissolve yourselves\ninto tears! The one half of my life [i.e. Rodrigo] has laid the other\n[half, i.e. my father] in the grave, and compels me to revenge,",
      " after\nthis fatal blow, that which I have no more [i.e. my father] on that\nwhich still remains to me [i.e. Rodrigo].\n\n_Elvira._ Calm yourself, dear lady.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! how unsuitably, in a misfortune so great, thou speakest\nof calmness. By what means can my sorrow ever be appeased, if I cannot\nhate the hand which has caused it? And what ought I to hope for but a\nnever-ending anguish if I follow up a crime, still loving the criminal.\n\n_Elvira._ He deprives you of a father, and you still love him?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ It is too little to say love, Elvira; I adore him! My passion\nopposes itself to my resentment; in mine enemy I find my lover, and I\nfeel that in spite of all my rage Rodrigo is still contending against my\nsire in my heart. He attacks it, he besieges it; it yields, it defends\nitself; at one time strong, at one time weak, at another triumphant. But\nin this severe struggle between wrath and love, he rends my heart\nwithout shaking my resolution,",
      " and although my love may have power over\nme, I do not consult it [_or_, hesitate] to follow my duty. I speed on\n[_lit._ run] without halting [_or_, weighing the consequences] where my\nhonor compels me. Rodrigo is very dear to me; the interest I feel in him\ngrieves me; my heart takes his part, but, in spite of its struggles, I\nknow what I am [i.e. a daughter], and that my father is dead.\n\n_Elvira._ Do you think of pursuing [_or_, persecuting] him?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! cruel thought! and cruel pursuit to which I see myself\ncompelled. I demand his head [_or_, life] and I dread to obtain it; my\ndeath will follow his, and [yet] I wish to punish him!\n\n_Elvira._ Abandon, abandon, dear lady, a design so tragic, and do not\nimpose on yourself such a tyrannical law.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! my father being dead and almost in my arms--shall his\nblood cry for revenge and I not obtain it? My heart, shamefully led away\nby other spells, would believe that it owed him only ineffectual tears.\nAnd can I endure that an insidious love,",

Do not persist in this morbid [_lit._ strange] humor.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ My honor is at stake; I must avenge myself; and, however the\ndesires of love may beguile us, all excuse [for not doing one's duty] is\ndisgraceful to [i.e. in the estimation of] noble-minded souls.\n\n_Elvira._ But you love Rodrigo--he cannot offend you.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I confess it.\n\n_Elvira._ After all, what then do you intend to do?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ To preserve my honor and to end my sorrow; to pursue him, to\ndestroy him, and to die after him.\n\n\nScene IV.--DON RODRIGO, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Well then,",

      " and cause it thus to lose the\ndeath-stain of thine own.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! what cruelty, which all in one day slays the father by\nthe sword [itself], and the daughter by the sight of it! Remove this\nobject, I cannot endure it; thou wished me to listen to thee, and thou\ncausest me to die!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I do what thou wishest, but without abandoning the desire\nof ending by thy hands my lamentable life; for, in fine, do not expect\n[even] from my affection a dastardly repentance of a justifiable [_lit._\ngood] action. The irreparable effect of a too hasty excitement\ndishonored my father and covered me with shame. Thou knowest how a blow\naffects a man of courage. I shared in the insult, I sought out its\nauthor, I saw him, I avenged my honor and my father; I would do it again\nif I had it to do. Not that, indeed, my passion did not long struggle\nfor thee against my father and myself; judge of its power--under such an\ninsult, I was able to deliberate whether I should take vengeance for it!\nCompelled to displease thee or to endure an affront,",
      " I thought that in\nits turn my arm was too prompt [to strike]; I accused myself of too much\nimpetuosity, and thy loveliness, without doubt, would have turned the\nscale [_or_, prevailed overall] had I not opposed to thy strongest\nattractions the [thought] that a man without honor would not merit thee;\nthat, in spite of this share which I had in thy affections, she who\nloved me noble would hate me shamed; that to listen to thy love, to obey\nits voice, would be to render myself unworthy of it and to condemn thy\nchoice. I tell thee still, and although I sigh at it, even to my last\nsigh I will assuredly repeat it, I have committed an offence against\nthee, and I was driven to [_or_, bound to commit] it to efface my shame\nand to merit thee; but discharged [from my duty] as regards honor, and\ndischarged [from duty] towards my father, it is now to thee that I come\nto give satisfaction--it is to offer to thee my blood that thou seest\nme in this place. I did my duty [_lit._ that which I ought to have done]\nthen,",
      " I still do it now. I know that a slain [_lit._ dead] father arms\nthee against my offence; I have not wished to rob thee of thy victim;\nsacrifice with courage to the blood he has lost he who constitutes his\nglory in having shed it.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah, Rodrigo, it is true, although thine enemy, I cannot blame\nthee for having shunned disgrace; and in whatever manner my griefs burst\nforth I do not accuse [thee], I [only] lament my misfortunes. I know\nwhat honor after such an insult demanded with ardor of a generous\ncourage; thou hast only done the duty of a man of honor, but also in\ndoing that [duty] thou hast taught me mine. Thy fatal valor has\ninstructed me by thy victory--it has avenged thy father and maintained\nthy glory. The same care concerns me, and I have to add to my infliction\n[_lit._ to afflict me] my fame to sustain and my father to avenge. Alas!\nthy fate [_or_, your share] in this drives me to despair! If any other\nmisfortune had taken from me my father,",
      " my soul would have found in the\nhappiness of seeing thee the only relief which it could have received,\nand in opposition to my grief I should have felt a fond delight [_lit._\ncharm or a magic soothing] when a hand so dear would have wiped away my\ntears. But I must lose thee after having lost him. This struggle over my\npassion is due to my honor, and this terrible duty, whose [imperious]\ncommand is slaying me, compels me to exert myself [_lit._ labor or work]\nfor thy destruction. For, in fine, do not expect from my affection any\nmorbid [_lit._ cowardly] feelings as to thy punishment. However strongly\nmy love may plead in thy favor, my steadfast courage must respond to\nthine. Even in offending me, thou hast proved thyself worthy of me; I\nmust, by thy death, prove myself worthy of thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Defer, then, no longer that which honor commands. It\ndemands my head [_or_, life], and I yield it to thee; make a sacrifice\nof it to this noble duty; the [death] stroke will be welcome [_lit._\nsweet], as well as the doom. To await,",
      " after my crime, a tardy justice,\nis to defer thine honor as well as my punishment. I should die too happy\nin dying by so delightful a [death] blow!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Go [i.e. no]; I am thy prosecutor, and not thy executioner.\nIf thou offerest me thine head, is it for me to take it; I ought to\nattack it, but thou oughtest to defend it. It is from another than thee\nthat I must obtain it, and it is my duty [_lit._ I ought] to pursue\nthee, but not to punish thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ However in my favor our love may plead, thy steadfast\ncourage ought to correspond to mine; and to borrow other arms to avenge\na father is, believe me, my Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, not the [method of] responding to\nit. My hand alone was fit [_lit._ has understood how] to avenge the\ninsult offered to _my_ father; thy hand alone ought to take vengeance\nfor thine.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ O cruel! for what reason shouldst thou persevere on this\npoint? Thou hast avenged thyself without aid,",
      " and dost thou wish to give\nme thine [aid]? I shall follow thy example; and I have too much courage\nto endure that my glory shall be divided with thee. My father and mine\nhonor shall owe nothing to the dictates of thy love and of thy despair.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ O cruel resolution [_lit._ point of honor]! Alas!\nwhatever I may do, can I by no means obtain this concession [_or_,\nfavor]? In the name of a slain [_lit._ dead] father, or of our\nfriendship, punish me through revenge, or at least through compassion.\nThy unhappy lover will have far less pain in dying by thy hand than in\nliving with thy hatred.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Go; I do not hate thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Thou oughtest to do so.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ I cannot.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Dost thou so little fear calumny, and so little [fear]\nfalse reports? When people shall know my crime, and that thy passion\n[for me] still continues, what will not envy and deception spread\nabroad? Compel them to silence, and, without debating more, save thy\nfair fame by causing me to die.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ That [fair fame]",
      " shines far more gloriously [_lit._ better]\nby leaving thee life; and I wish that the voice of the blackest slander\nshould raise to heaven my honor, and lament my griefs, knowing that I\nworship thee, and that [still] I pursue thee [as a criminal]. Go, then;\npresent no more to my unbounded grief that which I [must] lose, although\nI love it [him]! In the shades of night carefully conceal thy departure;\nif they see thee going forth, my honor runs a risk. The only opportunity\nwhich slander can have is to know that I have tolerated thy presence\nhere. Give it no opportunity to assail my honor.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let me die.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Nay, leave me.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ On what art thou resolved?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ In spite of the glorious love-fires which impede [_lit._\ntrouble] my wrath, I will do my utmost to avenge my father; but, in\nspite of the sternness of such a cruel duty, my sole desire is to be\nable to accomplish nothing [against thee].\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ O wondrous love [_lit._ miracle of love]!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ O accumulation of sorrows!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ What misfortunes and tears will our fathers cost us!\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Rodrigo,",

I go to drag along a lingering life, until it be\ntorn from me by thy pursuit.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If I obtain my purpose, I pledge to thee my faith to exist\nnot a moment after thee. Adieu! Go hence, and, above all, take good care\nthat you are not observed.

In the midst\nof happiness my soul feels their pang: I float in joy, and I tremble\nwith fear. I have seen [lying] dead the enemy who had insulted me, yet I\nam unable to find [_lit._ see] the hand which has avenged me. I exert\nmyself in vain, and with a useless anxiety. Feeble [_lit._ broken down;\n_or_, shattered] though I am, I traverse all the city; this slight\ndegree of vigor, that my advanced years have left me, expends itself\nfruitlessly in seeking this conqueror. At every moment, at all places,\nin a night so dark, I think that I embrace him, and I embrace only a\nshadow; and my love, beguiled by this deceitful object, forms for itself\nsuspicions which redouble my fear. I do not discover any traces of his\nflight. I fear the dead Count's friends and retinue; their number\nterrifies me, and confounds my reason. Rodrigo lives no more,",

My valor has no reason to disown thee; thou hast well\nimitated it, and thy brilliant prowess causes the heroes of my race to\nlive again in thee! It is from them that thou descendest, it is from me\nthat thou art sprung. Thy first combat [_lit._ sword-stroke] equals all\nof mine, and thy youth, fired with a splendid enthusiasm, by this great\nproof equals [_or_, reaches to] my renown.

      "insult which thy courage effaces!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ The honor of it belongs to you. I could not do less,\nbeing sprung from you, and trained under your careful instruction\n[_lit._ cares]. I consider myself too happy [at the result], and my soul\nis delighted that my first combat [_or_, maiden-stroke] pleases him to\nwhom I owe existence. But, amidst your gladness, be not jealous if, in\nmy turn, I dare to satisfy myself after you. Permit that in freedom my\ndespair may burst forth; enough and for too long your discourse has\nsoothed it. I do not repent having served you; but give me back the\nblessing which that [death] blow has deprived me of. My arms, in order\nto serve you, battling against my passion, by this [otherwise] glorious\ndeed have deprived me of my love. Say no more to me: for you I have lost\nall; what I owed you I have well repaid.\n\n_Don Diego._ Carry, carry still higher the effect [_lit._ fruit] of thy\nvictory. I have given thee life, and thou restorest to me my honor; and\nas much as honor is dearer to me than life,",
      " so much now I owe thee in\nreturn. But spurn this weakness from a noble heart; we have but one\nhonor--there are many mistresses. Love is but a pleasure; honor is a\nduty.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Ah! what do you say to me?\n\n_Don Diego._ That which you ought to know.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ My outraged honor takes vengeance on myself, and you dare\nto urge me to the shame of inconstancy! Disgrace is the same, and\nfollows equally the soldier without courage and the faithless lover. Do\nno wrong, then, to my fidelity; allow me [to be] brave without rendering\nmyself perfidious [perjured]. My bonds are too strong to be thus\nbroken--my faith still binds me, though I [may] hope no more; and, not\nbeing able to leave nor to win Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, the death which I seek is my\nmost welcome [_lit._ sweeter] penalty.\n\n_Don Diego._ It is not yet time to seek death; thy prince and thy\ncountry have need of thine arm. The fleet, as was feared, having entered\nthis great river, hopes to surprise the city and to ravage the country.\nThe Moors are going to make a descent,",
      " and the tide and the night may,\nwithin an hour, bring them noiselessly to our walls. The court is in\ndisorder, the people in dismay; we hear only cries, we see only tears.\nIn this public calamity, my good fortune has so willed it that I have\nfound [thronging] to my house five hundred of my friends, who, knowing\nthe insult offered to me, impelled by a similar zeal, came all to offer\nthemselves to avenge my quarrel. Thou hast anticipated them; but their\nvaliant hands will be more nobly steeped in the blood of Africans. Go,\nmarch at their head where honor calls thee; it is thou whom their noble\nband would have as a leader. Go, resist the advance of these ancient\nenemies; there, if thou wishest to die, find a glorious death. Seize the\nopportunity, since it is presented to thee; cause your King to owe his\nsafety to your loss; but rather return from that battle-field [_lit._\nfrom it] with the laurels on thy brow.

Do you know for certain, Elvira?\n\n_Elvira._ You could never believe how every one admires him, and extols\nto heaven, with one common voice, the glorious achievements of this\nyoung hero. The Moors appeared before him only to their shame; their\napproach was very rapid, their flight more rapid still. A three hours'\nbattle left to our warriors a complete victory, and two kings as\nprisoners. The valor of their leader overcame every obstacle [_lit._\nfound no obstacles].\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ And the hand of Rodrigo has wrought all these wonders!\n\n_Elvira._ Of his gallant deeds these two kings are the reward;",
      " by his\nhand they were conquered, and his hand captured them.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ From whom couldst thou ascertain these strange tidings?\n\n_Elvira._ From the people, who everywhere sing his praises, [who] call\nhim the object and the author of their rejoicing, their guardian angel\nand their deliverer.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ And the King--with what an aspect does he look upon such\nvalor?\n\n_Elvira._ Rodrigo dares not yet appear in his presence, but Don Diego,\ndelighted, presents to him in chains, in the name of this conqueror,\nthese crowned captives, and asks as a favor from this generous prince\nthat he condescend to look upon the hand which has saved the kingdom\n[_lit._ province].\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ But is he not wounded?\n\n_Elvira._ I have learned nothing of it. You change color! Recover your\nspirits.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Let me recover then also my enfeebled resentment; caring for\nhim, must I forget my own feelings [_lit._ myself]? They boast of him,\nthey praise him, and my heart consents to it; my honor is mute, my duty\nimpotent.",
      " Down [_lit._ silence], O [treacherous] love! let my resentment\nexert itself [_lit._ act]; although he has conquered two kings, he has\nslain my father! These mourning robes in which I read my misfortune are\nthe first-fruits which his valor has produced; and although others may\ntell of a heart so magnanimous, here all objects speak to me of his\ncrime. Ye who give strength to my feelings of resentment, veil, crape,\nrobes, dismal ornaments, funeral garb in which his first victory\nenshrouds me, do you sustain effectually my honor in opposition to my\npassion, and when my love shall gain too much power, remind my spirit of\nmy sad duty; attack, without fearing anything, a triumphant hand!\n\n_Elvira._ Calm this excitement; see--here comes the Infanta.\n\n\nScene II.--The INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, LEONORA, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ I do not come here [vainly] to console thy sorrows; I come\nrather to mingle my sighs with thy tears.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Far rather take part in the universal rejoicings,",
      " and taste\nthe happiness which heaven sends you, dear lady; no one but myself has a\nright to sigh. The danger from which Rodrigo has been able to rescue\nyou, and the public safety which his arms restore to you, to me alone\nto-day still permit tears; he has saved the city, he has served his\nKing, and his valiant arm is destructive only to myself.\n\n_Infanta._ My Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, it is true that he has wrought wonders.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Already this vexatious exclamation of joy [_lit._ noise] has\nreached [_lit._ struck] my ears, and I hear him everywhere proclaimed\naloud as brave a warrior as he is an unfortunate lover.\n\n_Infanta._ What annoyance can the approving shouts of the people cause\nthee? This youthful Mars whom they praise has hitherto been able to\nplease thee; he possessed thy heart; he lived under thy law; and to\npraise his valor is to honor thy choice.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Every one [else] can praise it with some justice; but for me\nhis praise is a new punishment. They aggravate my grief by raising him\nso high. I see what I lose,",

The more I understand his worth, the\nmore my passion increases; yet my duty is always the stronger [passion],\nand, in spite of my love, endeavors to accomplish his destruction\n[_lit._ to pursue his death].\n\n_Infanta._ Yesterday, this duty placed thee in high estimation; the\nstruggle which thou didst make appeared so magnanimous, so worthy of a\nnoble heart, that everyone at the court admired thy resolution and\npitied thy love. But wilt thou believe in the advice of a faithful\nfriendship?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Not to obey you would render me disloyal.\n\n_Infanta._ What was justifiable then is not so to-day. Rodrigo now is\nour sole support, the hope and the idol [_lit._ love] of a people that\nworships him! The prop of Castile and the terror of the Moor! The King\nhimself recognizes [_lit._ is in agreement with] this truth, that thy\nfather in him alone sees himself recalled to life: and if, in fine, thou\nwishest that I should explain myself briefly [_lit._ in two words],\nthou art seeking in his destruction the public ruin.",
      " What! to avenge a\nfather, is it ever lawful to surrender one's country into the hands of\nenemies? Against us is thy revenge lawful? And must we be punished who\nhad no share in the crime? After all, it is only that thou shouldest\nespouse the man whom a dead father compelled thee to accuse; I myself\nwould wish to relieve thee of that desire [_lit._ take the desire of\nthat from thee]; take from him thy love, but leave us his life.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Ah! it is not in me to have so much kindness; the duty which\nexcites me has no limit. Although my love pleads [_lit._ interests\nitself] for this conqueror, although a nation worships him, and a King\npraises him, although he be surrounded with the most valiant warriors, I\nshall endeavor to crush his laurels beneath my [funereal] cypress.\n\n_Infanta._ It is a noble feeling when, to avenge a father, our duty\nassails a head so dear; but it is duty of a still nobler order when ties\nof blood are sacrificed to the public [advantage]. No, believe me, it is\n",
      "enough to quench thy love; he will be too severely punished if he exists\nno more in thy affections. Let the welfare of thy country impose upon\nthee this law; and, besides, what dost thou think that the King will\ngrant thee?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ He can refuse me, but I cannot keep silent.\n\n_Infanta._ Reflect well, my [dear] Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, on what thou wishest to do.\nAdieu; [when] alone thou cans't think over this at thy leisure.

Thou descendant of so many\nancestors signalized by valor, whom the first attempt of thine own\n[prowess] has so soon equalled; my ability to recompense thee is too\nlimited [_lit._ small], and I have less power than thou hast merit.",
      " The\ncountry delivered from such a fierce enemy, my sceptre firmly placed in\nmy hand by thine own [hand], and the Moors defeated before, amid these\nterrors, I could give orders for repulsing their arms; these are\nbrilliant services which leave not to thy King the means or the hope of\ndischarging his debt of gratitude [_lit._ acquitting himself] towards\nthee. But the two kings, thy captives, shall be thy reward. Both of them\nin my presence have named thee their Cid--since Cid, in their language,\nis equivalent to lord, I shall not envy thee this glorious title of\ndistinction; be thou, henceforth, the Cid; to that great name let\neverything yield; let it overwhelm with terror both Granada and Toledo,\nand let it indicate to all those who live under my laws both how\nvaluable thou art to me [_lit._ that which thou art worth to me], and\nthat [deep obligation] which I owe thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Let your majesty, sire, spare my modesty. On such an\nhumble service your majesty [_lit._ it, referring to majesty] sets too\nhigh a value,",
      " and compels me to blush [for shame] before so great a\nKing, at so little deserving the honor which I have received from him.

      " if I must lose it, it would have been far more delightful\nfor me to depart from life while fighting for you.\n\n_Don Fernando._ I pardon thy warmth in avenging the insult offered to\nthee, and the kingdom shielded [from danger] pleads [_lit._ speaks to\nme] in thy defence. Be assured that henceforth Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne will speak in\nvain, and I shall listen to her no more except to comfort her; but\ncontinue.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Under me, then, this band advances, and bears in its\naspect a manly confidence. At setting out we were five hundred, but, by\na speedy reinforcement, we saw ourselves [augmented to] three thousand\non arriving at the port; so surely, on beholding us advance with such a\n[determined] aspect, did the most dismayed recover their courage. Of\nthat brave host [_lit._ of it], as soon as we had arrived, I conceal\ntwo-thirds in the holds of the ships which were found there; the rest,\nwhose numbers were increasing every hour, burning with impatience,\nremain around me; they lie down on the ground, and, without making any\nnoise, they pass a considerable portion of so auspicious [_lit._\nbeautiful]",
      " a night. By my command the guard does the same, and keeping\nthemselves, concealed aid my stratagem, and I boldly pretended to have\nreceived from you the order which they see me follow out, and which I\nissue to all. This dim light which falls from the stars, at last with\nthe tide causes us to see thirty vessels [_lit._ sails]; the wave\n[i.e. the water] swells beneath them, and, with a mutual effort, the\nMoors and the sea advance even to the port. We let them pass; all seems\nto them lulled in repose [_lit._ tranquil]. No soldiers at the port,\nnone on the walls of the city. Our deep silence deceiving their minds,\nthey no longer dare to doubt that they had taken us by surprise. They\nland without fear, they cast anchor, they disembark and rush forward to\ndeliver themselves into the hands which are awaiting them. Then we\narise, and all at the same time utter towards heaven countless ringing\ncheers [of defiance]. At these shouts our men from our ships answer [to\nthe signal]; they appear armed, the Moors are dismayed, terror seizes\nthose who had scarcely disembarked,",
      " before fighting they consider\nthemselves lost--they hastened to plunder and they meet with war. We\npress them hard on the water, we press them hard on the land, and we\ncause rivulets of their blood to run before any [of them] can resist or\nregain his position. But soon, in spite of us, their princes rally them,\ntheir courage revives, and their fears are forgotten. The disgrace of\ndying without having fought rallies their disordered ranks [_lit._ stops\ntheir disorder], and restores to them their valor. With firmly planted\nfeet they draw their scimitars against us, and cause a fearful\nintermingling of our blood with theirs; and the land, and the wave, and\nthe fleet, and the port are fields of carnage where death is\ntriumphant. Oh! how many noble deeds, how many brilliant achievements,\nwere performed unnoticed [_lit._ have remained without renown] in the\nmidst of the gloom, in which each [warrior], sole witness of the\nbrilliant strokes which he gave, could not discern to which side fortune\ninclined. I went in all directions to encourage our soldiers, to cause\nsome to advance,",
      " and to support others, to marshal those who were coming\nup, to urge them forward in their turn, and I could not ascertain the\nresult [of the conflict] until the break of day. But at last the bright\ndawn shows us our advantage. The Moor sees his loss and loses courage\nsuddenly, and, seeing a reinforcement which had come to assist us, the\nardor for conquest yields to the dread of death. They gain their ships,\nthey cut their cables, they utter even to heaven terrific cries, they\nmake their retreat in confusion and without reflecting whether their\nkings can escape with them. Their fright is too strong to admit of this\nduty. The incoming tide brought them here, the outgoing tide carries\nthem away. Meanwhile their kings, combating amongst us, and a few of\ntheir [warriors] severely wounded by our blows, still fight valiantly\nand sell their lives dearly. I myself in vain urge them to surrender;\nscimitar in hand, they listen not to my entreaties, but seeing all their\nsoldiers falling at their feet, and that henceforward alone they defend\nthemselves in vain, they ask for the commander; I entitle myself as\nsuch,",
      " and they surrender. I sent you them both at the same time, and the\ncombat ceased for want of combatants. It is in this manner that for your\nservice----\n\n\nScene IV.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON RODRIGO, DON ARIAS, DON ALONZO,\nand DON SANCHO.\n\n\n_Don Alonzo._ Sire, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne comes to demand justice from you.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Vexatious news and unwelcome duty! Go [Rodrigo]; I do\nnot wish her to see thee. Instead of thanks I must drive thee away; but,\nbefore departing, come, let thy King embrace thee!\n\n[_Exit Don Rodrigo._]\n\n_Don Diego._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne pursues him, [yet] she wishes to save him.\n\n_Don Fernando._ They say that she loves him, and I am going to prove it.\nExhibit a more sorrowful countenance [_lit._ eye].\n\n\nScene V.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON SANCHO, DON ALONZO,\nCHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Don Fernando._ At last, be content, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, success responds to your\n",
      "wishes. Although Rodrigo has gained the advantage over our enemies, he\nhas died before our eyes of the wounds he has received; return thanks to\nthat heaven which has avenged you. (_To Don Diego._) See, how already\nher color is changed!\n\n_Don Diego._ But see! she swoons, and in this swoon, sire, observe the\neffect of an overpowering [_lit._ perfect] love. Her grief has betrayed\nthe secrets of her soul, and no longer permits you to doubt her passion.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What, then! Is Rodrigo dead?\n\n_Don Fernando._ No, no, he still lives [_lit._ he sees the day]; and he\nstill preserves for you an unalterable affection; calm this sorrow which\ntakes such an interest in his favor.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, we swoon from joy, as well as from grief; an excess of\npleasure renders us completely exhausted, and when it takes the mind by\nsurprise, it overpowers the senses.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Dost thou wish that in thy favor we should believe in\nimpossibilities? Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, thy grief appeared too clearly visible.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Well,",
      " sire! add this crown to my misfortune--call my swoon\nthe effect of my grief; a justifiable dissatisfaction reduced me to that\nextremity; his death would have saved his head from my pursuit. If he\nhad died of wounds received for the benefit of his country, my revenge\nwould have been lost, and my designs betrayed; such a brilliant end [of\nhis existence] would have been too injurious to me. I demand his death,\nbut not a glorious one, not with a glory which raises him so high, not\non an honorable death-bed, but upon a scaffold. Let him die for my\nfather and not for his country; let his name be attainted and his memory\nblighted. To die for one's country is not a sorrowful doom; it is to\nimmortalize one's self by a glorious death! I love then his victory, and\nI can do so without criminality; it [the victory] secures the kingdom\nand yields to me my victim. But ennobled, but illustrious amongst all\nwarriors, the chief crowned with laurels instead of flowers--and to say\nin a word what I think--worthy of being sacrificed to the shade of my\n",
      "father. Alas! by what [vain] hope do I allow myself to be carried away?\nRodrigo has nothing to dread from me; what can tears which are despised\navail against him? For him your whole empire is a sanctuary [_lit._ a\nplace of freedom]; there, under your power, everything is lawful for\nhim; he triumphs over me as [well as] over his enemies; justice stifled\nin their blood that has been shed, serves as a new trophy for the crime\nof the conqueror. We increase its pomp, and contempt of the law causes\nus to follow his [triumphal] chariot between two kings.\n\n_Don Fernando._ My daughter, these transports are too violent [_lit._\nhave too much violence]. When justice is rendered, all is put in the\nscale. Thy father has been slain, he was the aggressor; and justice\nitself commands me [to have] mercy. Before accusing that [degree of\nclemency] which I show, consult well thine heart; Rodrigo is master of\nit; and thy love in secret returns thanks to thy King, whose favor\npreserves such a lover for thee.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ For me!",
      " my enemy! the object of my wrath! the author of my\nmisfortunes? the slayer of my father! To my just pursuit [of vengeance]\nthey pay so little attention, that they believe that they are conferring\na favor on me by not listening to it. Since you refuse justice to my\ntears, sire, permit me to have recourse to arms; it is by that alone\nthat he has been able to injure me, and it is by that (means) also that\nI ought to avenge myself. From all your knights I demand his head; yes,\nlet one of them bring it to me, and I will be his prize; let them fight\nhim, sire, and, the combat being finished, I [will] espouse the\nconqueror, if Rodrigo is slain [_lit._ punished]. Under your authority,\npermit this to be made public.\n\n_Don Fernando._ This ancient custom established in these places, under\nthe guise of punishing an unjust affront, weakens a kingdom [by\ndepriving it] of its best warriors; the deplorable success of this abuse\n[of power] often crushes the innocent and shields the guilty. From this\n[ordeal] I release Rodrigo;",
      " he is too precious to me to expose him to\nthe [death] blows of capricious fate; and whatever (offence) a heart so\nmagnanimous could commit, the Moors, in retreating, have carried away\nhis crime.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What, sire, for him alone you reverse the laws, which all the\ncourt has so often seen observed! What will your people think, and what\nwill envy say, if he screens his life beneath your shield and he makes\nit a pretext not to appear [on a scene] where all men of honor seek a\nnoble death? Such favors would too deeply tarnish his glory; let him\nenjoy [_lit._ taste] without shame [_lit._ blushing] the fruits of his\nvictory. The count had audacity, he was able to punish him for it; he\n[i.e. Rodrigo] acted like a man of courage, and ought to maintain it\n[that character].\n\n_Don Fernando._ Since you wish it, I grant that he shall do so; but a\nthousand others would take the place of a vanquished warrior, and the\nreward which Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne has promised to the conqueror would render all my\n",
      "cavaliers his enemies; to oppose him alone to all would be too great an\ninjustice; it is enough, he shall enter the lists once only. Choose who\n[what champion] you will, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and choose well; but after this\ncombat ask nothing more.\n\n_Don Diego._ Release not by that those whom his valor [_lit._ arm]\nterrifies; leave an open field which none will [dare to] enter. After\nwhat Rodrigo has shown us to-day, what courage sufficiently presumptuous\nwould dare to contend with him? Who would risk his life against such an\nopponent? Who will be this valiant, or rather this rash individual?\n\n_Don Sancho._ Open the lists, you see this assailant; I am this rash or\nrather this valiant [champion]. Grant this favor to the zeal which urges\nme on; dear lady, you know what your promise is.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, do you confide your quarrel to his hand?\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, I have promised it.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Be ready to-morrow.\n\n_Don Diego._ No, sire, there is no need to defer the contest; a man is\n",
      "always ready when he possesses courage.\n\n_Don Fernando._ [What!] To come forth from one battle and to (instantly)\nenter the lists [_lit._ to fight]?\n\n_Don Diego._ Rodrigo has regained breath in relating to you this [i.e.\nthe history of that battle].\n\n_Don Fernando._ I desire that he should rest at least an hour or two;\nbut, for fear that such a combat may be considered as a precedent, to\ntestify to all that I permit, with regret, a sanguinary ordeal which has\nnever pleased me, it shall not have the presence either of myself or of\nmy court. [_To Don Arias._] You alone shall judge of the valor of the\ncombatants. Take care that both act like men of honor [_lit._ courage],\nand, the combat ended, bring the victor to me. Whoever he may be, the\nsame reward is gained by his exertions; I desire with my own hand to\npresent him to Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and that, as a recompense, he may receive her\nplighted faith.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What, sire! [would you] impose on me so stern a law?\n\n_Don Fernando._ Thou complainest of it;",
      " but thy love, far from\nacknowledging thy complaint, if Rodrigo be the conqueror, without\nrestraint accepts [the conditions]. Cease to murmur against such a\ngentle decree; whichever of the two be the victor, I shall make him thy\nspouse.\n\n\n\n\nACT THE FIFTH.\n\n\nScene I.--DON RODRIGO and CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! Rodrigo! In broad daylight! Whence comes this audacity?\nGo, thou art ruining my honor; retire, I beseech thee.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I go to die, dear lady, and I come to bid you in this\nplace, before the mortal blow, a last adieu. This unchangeable love,\nwhich binds me beneath your laws, dares not to accept my death without\npaying to you homage for it.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Thou art going to death!\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I speed to those happy moments which will deliver my life\nfrom your (feelings of) resentment.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Thou art going to death! Is Don Sancho, then, so formidable,\nthat he can inspire terror in this invincible heart? What has rendered\nthee so weak?",
      " or what renders him so strong? Does Rodrigo go to fight,\nand believe himself already slain [_lit._ dead]? He who has not feared\nthe Moors nor my father, goes to fight Don Sancho, and already despairs?\nThus, then, thy courage lowers itself in the [hour of] need.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ I speed [_lit._ I run] to my punishment, and not to the\ncombat; and, since you seek my death, my faithful ardor will readily\ndeprive me of the desire of defending my life. I have always the same\ncourage, but I have not the [strong] arm, when it is needed, to preserve\nthat which does not please you; and already this night would have been\nfatal to me, if I had fought for my own private wrong; but, defending my\nking, his people, and my country, by carelessly defending myself, I\nshould have betrayed _them_. My high-born spirit does not hate life so\nmuch as to wish to depart from it by perfidy, now that it regards my\ninterests only. You demand my death--I accept its decree. Your\nresentment chose the hand of another; I was unworthy [_lit._ I did not\n",
      "deserve] to die by yours. They shall not see me repel its blows; I owe\nmore respect to him [the champion] who fights for you; and delighted to\nthink that it is from you these [blows] proceed--since it is your honor\nthat his arms sustain--I shall present to him my unprotected [_or_,\ndefenceless] breast, worshipping through his hand thine that destroys\nme.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If the just vehemence of a sad [sense of] duty, which causes\nme, in spite of myself, to follow after thy valiant life, prescribes to\nthy love a law so severe, that it surrenders thee without defence to him\nwho combats for me, in this infatuation [_lit._ blindness], lose not the\nrecollection, that, with thy life, thine honor is tarnished, and that,\nin whatever renown Rodrigo may have lived, when men shall know him to be\ndead, they will believe him conquered. Thine honor is dearer to thee\nthan I am dear, since it steeps thine hands in the blood of my father,\nand causes thee to renounce, in spite of thy love, the sweet hope of\n",
      "gaining me. I see thee, however, pay such little regard to it [honor],\nthat, without fighting, thou wishest to be overcome. What inconsistency\n[_lit._ unequality] mars thy valor! Why hast thou it [that valor] no\nmore? or why didst thou possess it [formerly]? What! art thou valiant\nonly to do me an injury? Unless it be to offend [_or_, injure] me, hast\nthou no courage at all? And dost thou treat my father with such rigor\n[i.e. so far disparage the memory of my father], that, after having\nconquered him, thou wilt endure a conqueror? Go! without wishing to die,\nleave me to pursue thee, and defend thine honor, if thou wilt no longer\nlive.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ After the death of the count and the defeat of the\nMoors, will my renown still require other achievements? That [glory] may\nscorn the care of defending myself; it is known that my courage dares to\nattempt all, that my valor can accomplish all, and that, here below\n[_lit._ under the heavens], in comparison with mine honor, nothing is\nprecious to me.",
      " No! no! in this combat, whatever thou may'st please to\nthink, Rodrigo may die without risking his renown: without men daring to\naccuse him of having wanted spirit: without being considered as\nconquered, without enduring a conqueror. They will say only: \"He adored\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne; he would not live and merit her hatred; he yielded himself to\nthe severity of his fate, which compelled his mistress to seek his\ndeath; she wished for his life [_lit._ head], and his magnanimous heart,\nhad that been refused to her, would have considered it a crime. To\navenge his honor, he lost his love; to avenge his mistress, he forsook\nlife, preferring (whatever hope may have enslaved his soul) his honor to\nChim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne to his existence.\" Thus, then, you will see that my\ndeath in this conflict, far from obscuring my glory, will increase its\nvalue; and this honor will follow my voluntary death, that no other than\nmyself could have satisfied you [for the death of your father].\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Since, to prevent thee from rushing to destruction,",
      " thy life\nand thine honor are [but] feeble inducements, if ever I loved thee, dear\nRodrigo, in return [for that love], defend thyself now, to rescue me\nfrom Don Sancho. Fight, to release me from a compact which delivers me\nto the object of my aversion. Shall I say more to thee? Go, think of thy\ndefence, to overcome my sense of duty, to impose on me silence; and if\nthou feelest thine heart still enamored for me, come forth, as a\nconqueror, from a combat of which Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne is the reward. Adieu; this\nthoughtlessly uttered [_lit._ let slip] word causes me to blush for\nshame!\n\n[_Exit Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._]\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Where is the foe I could not now subdue? Come forth,\n[warriors] of Navarre, Morocco, and Castile! and all the heroes that\nSpain has produced; unite together and form an army, to contend against\none hand thus nerved [to action]. Unite all your efforts against a hope\nso sweet--you have too little power to succeed in destroying it!\n\n\nScene II.--THE INFANTA.\n\n\nShall I listen to thee still,",
      " pride of my birth, that makest a crime out\nof my passions? Shall I listen to thee, love, whose delicious power\ncauses my desires to rebel against this proud tyrant? Poor princess! to\nwhich of the two oughtest thou to yield obedience? Rodrigo, thy valor\nrenders thee worthy of me; but although thou art valiant, thou art not\nthe son of a king.\n\nPitiless fate, whose severity separates my glory and my desires! Is it\ndecreed [_lit._ said], that the choice of [a warrior of] such rare merit\nshould cost my passion such great anguish? O heaven! for how many\nsorrows [_lit._ sighs] must my heart prepare itself, if, after such a\nlong, painful struggle, it never succeeds in either extinguishing the\nlove, or accepting the lover!\n\nBut there are too many scruples, and my reason is alarmed at the\ncontempt of a choice so worthy; although to monarchs only my [proud]\nbirth may assign me, Rodrigo, with honor I shall live under thy laws.\nAfter having conquered two kings, couldst thou fail in obtaining a\ncrown? And this great name of Cid, which thou hast just now won--does it\n",
      "not show too clearly over whom thou art destined to reign?\n\nHe is worthy of me, but he belongs to Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne; the present which I made\nof him [to her], injures me. Between them, the death of a father has\ninterposed so little hatred, that the duty of blood with regret pursues\nhim. Thus let us hope for no advantage, either from his transgression or\nfrom my grief, since, to punish me, destiny has allowed that love should\ncontinue even between two enemies.\n\n\nScene III.--THE INFANTA and LEONORA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Whence [i.e. for what purpose] comest thou, Leonora?\n\n_Leonora._ To congratulate you, dear lady, on the tranquillity which at\nlast your soul has recovered.\n\n_Infanta._ From what quarter can tranquillity come [_lit._ whence should\nthis tranquillity come], in an accumulation of sorrow?\n\n_Leonora._ If love lives on hope, and if it dies with it, Rodrigo can no\nmore charm your heart; you know of the combat in which Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne involves\nhim; since he must die in it, or become her husband, your hope is dead\nand your spirit is healed.\n\n_",
      "Infanta._ Ah! how far from it!\n\n_Leonora._ What more can you expect?\n\n_Infanta._ Nay, rather, what hope canst thou forbid me [to entertain]?\nIf Rodrigo fights under these conditions, to counteract the effect of it\n[that conflict], I have too many resources. Love, this sweet author of\nmy cruel punishments, puts into [_lit._ teaches] the minds of lovers too\nmany stratagems.\n\n_Leonora._ Can _you_ [accomplish] anything, since a dead father has not\nbeen able to kindle discord in their minds? For Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne clearly shows by\nher behavior that hatred to-day does not cause her pursuit. She obtains\nthe [privilege of a] combat, and for her champion, she accepts on the\nmoment the first that offers. She has not recourse to those renowned\nknights [_lit._ noble hands] whom so many famous exploits render so\nglorious; Don Sancho suffices her, and merits her choice, because he is\ngoing to arm himself for the first time; she loves in this duel his want\nof experience; as he is without renown, [so] is she without\napprehension; and her readiness [to accept him], ought to make you\n",
      "clearly see that she seeks for a combat which her duty demands, but\nwhich yields her Rodrigo an easy victory, and authorizes her at length\nto seem appeased.\n\n_Infanta._ I observe it clearly; and nevertheless my heart, in rivalry\nwith Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, adores this conqueror. On what shall I resolve, hopeless\nlover that I am?\n\n_Leonora._ To remember better from whom you are sprung. Heaven owes you\na king; you love a subject!\n\n_Infanta._ The object of my attachment has completely changed: I no\nlonger love Rodrigo as a mere nobleman. No; it is not thus that my love\nentitles him. If I love him, it is [as] the author of so many brilliant\ndeeds; it is [as] the valiant Cid, the master of two kings. I shall\nconquer myself, however; not from dread of any censure, but in order\nthat I may not disturb so glorious a love; and even though, to favor me,\nthey should crown him, I will not accept again [_lit._ take back] a gift\nwhich I have given. Since in such a combat his triumph is certain, let\nus go once more to give him [_or_, that gift]",
      " to Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne. And thou, who\nseest the love-arrows with which my heart is pierced; come see me finish\nas I have begun.\n\n\nScene IV.--CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira, how greatly I suffer; and how much I am to be pitied!\nI know not what to hope, and I see everything to be dreaded. No wish\nescapes me to which I dare consent. I desire nothing without quickly\nrepenting of it [_lit._ a quick repentance]. I have caused two rivals to\ntake up arms for me: the most happy result will cause me tears; and\nthough fate may decree in my favor, my father is without revenge, or my\nlover is dead.\n\n_Elvira._ On the one side and the other I see you consoled; either you\nhave Rodrigo, or you are avenged. And however fate may ordain for you,\nit maintains your honor and gives you a spouse.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ What! the object of my hatred or of such resentment!--the\nslayer of Rodrigo, or that of my father! In either case [_lit._ on all\nsides] they give me a husband,",
      " still [all] stained with the blood that I\ncherished most; in either case my soul revolts, and I fear more than\ndeath the ending of my quarrel. Away! vengeance, love--which agitate my\nfeelings. Ye have no gratifications for me at such a price; and Thou,\nPowerful Controller of the destiny which afflicts me, terminate this\ncombat without any advantage, without rendering either of the two\nconquered or conqueror.\n\n_Elvira._ This would be treating you with too much severity. This combat\nis a new punishment for your feelings, if it leaves you [still]\ncompelled to demand justice, to exhibit always this proud resentment,\nand continually to seek after the death of your lover. Dear lady, it is\nfar better that his unequalled valor, crowning his brow, should impose\nsilence upon you; that the conditions of the combat should extinguish\nyour sighs; and that the King should compel you to follow your\ninclinations.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ If he be conqueror, dost thou believe that I shall\nsurrender? My strong [sense of] duty is too strong and my loss too\ngreat; and this [law of]",
      " combat and the will of the King are not strong\nenough to dictate conditions to them [i.e. to my duty and sorrow for\nmy loss]. He may conquer Don Sancho with very little difficulty, but he\nshall not with him [conquer] the sense of duty of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne; and whatever\n[reward] a monarch may have promised to his victory, my self-respect\nwill raise against him a thousand other enemies.\n\n_Elvira._ Beware lest, to punish this strange pride, heaven may at last\npermit you to revenge yourself. What!--you will still reject the\nhappiness of being able now to be reconciled [_lit._ to be silent] with\nhonor? What means this duty, and what does it hope for? Will the death\nof your lover restore to you a father? Is one [fatal] stroke of\nmisfortune insufficient for you? Is there need of loss upon loss, and\nsorrow upon sorrow? Come, in the caprice in which your humor persists,\nyou do not deserve the lover that is destined for you, and we may\n[_lit._ shall] see the just wrath of heaven, by his death, leaving you\nDon Sancho as a spouse.\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Elvira,",
      " the griefs which I endure are sufficient: do not\nredouble them by this fatal augury. I wish, if I can, to avoid both; but\nif not, in this conflict Rodrigo has all my prayers; not because a weak\n[_lit._ foolish] affection inclines me to his side, but because, if he\nwere conquered, I should become [the bride] of Don Sancho. This fear\ncreates [_lit._ causes to be born] my desire----\n\n            [_Enter Don Sancho._]\n\nWhat do I see, unhappy [woman that I am]!

Traitor,\ndost thou dare to show thyself before mine eyes, after having taken from\nme that [being] whom I love the best? Declare thyself my love, and thou\nhast no more to fear.

Go; you fell upon him treacherously. A warrior so valiant\nwould never have sunk beneath such an assailant! Hope nothing from me.\nThou hast not served me; and believing that thou wert avenging me, thou\nhast deprived me of life.\n\n_Don Sancho._ Strange delusion, which, far from listening to me----\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Wilt thou that I should listen to thee while boasting of his\ndeath?--that I should patiently hear with what haughty pride thou wilt\ndescribe his misfortune, my own crime, and thy prowess?\n\n\nScene VI.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON SANCHO, DON ALONZO,\nCHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Sire, there is no further need to dissemble that which all my\nstruggles have not been able to conceal from you. I loved, you knew it;\nbut, to avenge my father,",
      " I even wished to sacrifice so dear a being [as\nRodrigo]. Sire, your majesty may have seen how I have made love yield to\nduty. At last, Rodrigo is dead; and his death has converted me from an\nunrelenting foe into an afflicted lover. I owed this revenge to him who\ngave me existence; and to my love I now owe these tears. Don Sancho has\ndestroyed me in undertaking my defence; and I am the reward of the arm\nwhich destroys me. Sire, if compassion can influence a king, for mercy's\nsake revoke a law so severe. As the reward of a victory by which I lose\nthat which I love, I leave him my possessions; let him leave me to\nmyself, that in a sacred cloister I may weep continually, even to my\nlast sigh, for my father and my lover.\n\n_Don Diego._ In brief, she loves, sire, and no longer believes it a\ncrime to acknowledge with her own lips a lawful affection.\n\n_Don Fernando._ Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, be undeceived [_lit._ come out from thine\nerror]; thy lover is not dead, and the vanquished Don Sancho has given\n",
      "thee a false report.\n\n_Don Sancho._ Sire, a little too much eagerness, in spite of me, has\nmisled her; I came from the combat to tell her the result. This noble\nwarrior of whom her heart is enamored, when he had disarmed me, spoke to\nme thus: \"Fear nothing--I would rather leave the victory uncertain, than\nshed blood risked in defence of Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne; but, since my duty calls me to\nthe King, go, tell her of our combat [on my behalf]; on the part of the\nconqueror, carry her thy sword.\" Sire, I came; this weapon deceived her;\nseeing me return, she believed me to be conqueror, and her resentment\nsuddenly betrayed her love, with such excitement and so much impatience,\nthat I could not obtain a moment's hearing. As for me, although\nconquered, I consider myself fortunate; and in spite of the interests of\nmy enamored heart, [though] losing infinitely, I still love my defeat,\nwhich causes the triumph of a love so perfect.\n\n_Don Fernando._ My daughter, there is no need to blush for a passion so\nglorious,",
      " nor to seek means of making a disavowal of it; a laudable\n[sense of] shame in vain solicits thee; thy honor is redeemed, and thy\nduty performed; thy father is satisfied, and it was to avenge him that\nthou didst so often place thy Rodrigo in danger. Thou seest how heaven\notherwise ordains. Having done so much for him [i.e. thy father], do\nsomething for thyself; and be not rebellious against my command, which\ngives thee a spouse beloved so dearly.\n\n\nScene VII.--DON FERNANDO, DON DIEGO, DON ARIAS, DON RODRIGO, DON\nALONZO, DON SANCHO, THE INFANTA, CHIM\u00c3\u0088NE, LEONORA, and ELVIRA.\n\n\n_Infanta._ Dry thy tears, Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and receive without sadness this\nnoble conqueror from the hands of thy princess.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ Be not offended, sire, if in your presence an impassioned\nhomage causes me to kneel before her [_lit._ casts me before her knees].\nI come not here to ask for [the reward of] my victory; I come once more\n",
      "[_or_, anew] to offer you my head, dear lady. My love shall not employ\nin my own favor either the law of the combat or the will of the King. If\nall that has been done is too little for a father, say by what means you\nmust be satisfied. Must I still contend against a thousand and a\nthousand rivals, and to the two ends of the earth extend my labors,\nmyself alone storm a camp, put to flight an army, surpass the renown of\nfabulous heroes? If my deep offence can be by that means washed away, I\ndare undertake all, and can accomplish all. But if this proud honor,\nalways inexorable, cannot be appeased without the death of the guilty\n[offender], arm no more against me the power of mortals; mine head is at\nthy feet, avenge thyself by thine own hands; thine hands alone have the\nright to vanquish the invincible. Take thou a vengeance to all others\nimpossible. But at least let my death suffice to punish me; banish me\nnot from thy remembrance, and, since my doom preserves your honor, to\nrecompense yourself for this, preserve my memory,",
      " and say sometimes,\nwhen deploring my fate: \"Had he not loved me, he would not have died.\"\n\n_Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne._ Rise, Rodrigo. I must confess it, sire, I have said too much\nto be able to unsay it. Rodrigo has noble qualities which I cannot hate;\nand, when a king commands, he ought to be obeyed. But to whatever [fate]\nyou may have already doomed me, can you, before your eyes, tolerate this\nunion? And when you desire this effort from my feeling of duty, is it\nentirely in accord with your sense of justice? If Rodrigo becomes so\nindispensable to the state, of that which he has done for you ought I to\nbe the reward, and surrender myself to the everlasting reproach of\nhaving imbrued my hands in the blood of a father?\n\n_Don Fernando._ Time has often rendered lawful that which at first\nseemed impossible, without being a crime. Rodrigo has won thee, and thou\nart justly his. But, although his valor has by conquest obtained thee\nto-day, it would need that I should become the enemy of thy\nself-respect, to give him so soon the reward of his victory.",
      " This bridal\ndeferred does not break a law, which, without specifying the time,\ndevotes thy faith to him. Take a year, if thou wilt, to dry thy tears;\nRodrigo, in the mean time, must take up arms. After having vanquished\nthe Moors on our borders, overthrown their plans, and repulsed their\nattacks, go, carry the war even into their country, command my army,\nand ravage their territory. At the mere name of Cid they will tremble\nwith dismay. They have named thee lord! they will desire thee as their\nking! But, amidst thy brilliant [_lit._ high] achievements, be thou to\nher always faithful; return, if it be possible, still more worthy of\nher, and by thy great exploits acquire such renown, that it may be\nglorious for her to espouse thee then.\n\n_Don Rodrigo._ To gain Chim\u00c3\u00a8ne, and for your service, what command can\nbe issued to me that mine arm cannot accomplish? Yet, though absent from\nher [dear] eyes, I must suffer grief, sire, I have too much happiness in\nbeing able--to hope!\n\n_Don Fernando._ Hope in thy manly resolution;",
      " hope in my promise, and\nalready possessing the heart of thy mistress, let time, thy valor, and\nthy king exert themselves [_lit._ do, or act], to overcome a scrupulous\nfeeling of honor which is contending against thee.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cid, by Pierre Corneille\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CID ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14954-8.txt or 14954-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/9/5/14954/\n\nProduced by David Garcia, Branko Collin and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

(Herbert George) Wells\n\nRelease Date: October 2, 2004 [EBook #35]\n[Last updated: October 3, 2014]\n\nLanguage: English\n\n\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TIME MACHINE ***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Time Machine, by H. G. Wells [1898]\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)\nwas expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The\nfire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent\nlights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and\npassed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and\ncaressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that\nluxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully\nfree of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this\nway--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily\nadmired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\nand his fecundity.\n\n'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for\ninstance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.'\n\n'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?'\nsaid Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable\nground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You\nknow of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,\nhas no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a\nmathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.'\n\n'That is all right,' said the Psychologist.\n\n'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\nreal existence.'\n\n'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All\nreal things--'\n\n'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_\ncube exist?'\n\n'Don't follow you,' said Filby.\n\n'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\nexistence?'\n\nFilby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,\nthree which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.\nThere is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between\nthe former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that\nour consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the\nlatter from the beginning to the end of our lives.'\n\n'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight\nhis cigar over the lamp; 'that ... very clear indeed.'\n\n'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,'\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of\ncheerfulness. 'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,\nthough some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know\nthey mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is\nno difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space\nexcept that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish\npeople have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all\nheard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'\n\n'_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to\nthree planes, each at right angles to the others. But some\nphilosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions\nparticularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other\nthree?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.\nProfessor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York\nMathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat\nsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of\na three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models\nof three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could\nmaster the perspective of the thing. See?'\n\n'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his\nbrows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one\nwho repeats mystic words. 'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said after\nsome time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this\ngeometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results\nare curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight\nyears old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at\ntwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it\nwere, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned\nbeing, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n\n'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that\nTime is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,\na weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the\nmovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night\nit fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to\nhere. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the\ndimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced\nsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along\nthe Time-Dimension.'\n\n'But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'if\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why\nhas it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot\nwe move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. 'Are you sure we can move freely in\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two\ndimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.'\n\n'Not exactly,' said the Medical Man. 'There are balloons.'\n\n'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical\nmovement.'\n\n'Still they could move a little up and down,' said the Medical Man.\n\n'Easier, far easier down than up.'\n\n'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\npresent moment.'\n\n'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where\nthe whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the\npresent moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have\nno dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.'\n\n'But the great difficulty is this,' interrupted the Psychologist.\n'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot\nmove about in Time.'\n\n'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say\nthat we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling\nan incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:\nI become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of\ncourse we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any\nmore than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the\nground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this\nrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why\nshould he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or\naccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about\nand travel the other way?'\n\n'Oh, _this_,' began Filby, 'is all--'\n\n'Why not?' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'It's against reason,' said Filby.\n\n'What reason?' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you will\nnever convince me.'\n\n'Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller. 'But now you begin to see\nthe object of my investigations into the geometry of Four\nDimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--'\n\n'To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,\nas the driver determines.'\n\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\n\n'But I have experimental verification,' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,' the\nPsychologist suggested. 'One might travel back and verify the\naccepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!'\n\n'Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man.\n'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.'\n\n'One might get one's Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,'\nthe Very Young Man thought.\n\n'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.\nThe German scholars have improved Greek so much.'\n\n'Then there is the future,' said the Very Young Man. 'Just think!\nOne might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate at\ninterest, and hurry on ahead!'\n\n'To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communistic\nbasis.'\n\n'Of all the wild extravagant theories!' began the Psychologist.\n\n'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--'\n\n'Experimental verification!' cried I. 'You are going to verify\n_that_?'\n\n'The experiment!' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\n\n'Let's see your experiment anyhow,' said the Psychologist, 'though\nit's all humbug, you know.'\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,\nand with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly\nout of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long\npassage to his laboratory.\n\nThe Psychologist looked at us. 'I wonder what he's got?'\n\n'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,' said the Medical Man, and\nFilby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but\nbefore he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and\nFilby's anecdote collapsed.\n\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering\nmetallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very\ndelicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent\ncrystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that\nfollows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely\nunaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that\nwere scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with\ntwo legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.\nThen he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the\ntable was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon\nthe model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in\nbrass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that\nthe room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair\nnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between\nthe Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking\nover his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched\nhim in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The\nVery Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the\nalert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however\nsubtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played\nupon us under these conditions.\n\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'\nsaid the Psychologist.\n\n'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows\nupon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,\n'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through\ntime. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there\nis an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in\nsome way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,\nhere is one little white lever, and here is another.'\n\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\n'It's beautifully made,' he said.\n\n'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when\nwe had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now I\nwant you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,\nsends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses\nthe motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.\nPresently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will\ngo. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a\ngood look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy\nyourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,\nand then be told I'm a quack.'\n\nThere was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\nhis finger towards the lever. 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your\nhand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's\nhand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it\nwas the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine\non its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am\nabsolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of\nwind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel\nwas blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became\nindistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of\nfaintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save\nfor the lamp the table was bare.\n\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked\nunder the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.\n'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,\ngetting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his\nback to us began to fill his pipe.\n\nWe stared at each other. 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you\nin earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine\nhas travelled into time?'\n\n'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at\nthe fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the\nPsychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not\nunhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)\n'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he\nindicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to\nhave a journey on my own account.'\n\n'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'\nsaid Filby.\n\n'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'\n\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must have\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.\n\n'Why?' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it\ntravelled into the future it would still be here all this time,\nsince it must have travelled through this time.'\n\n'But,' I said, 'If it travelled into the past it would have been\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'\n\n'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\n\n'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'You\nthink. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,\nyou know, diluted presentation.'\n\n'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's a\nsimple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plain\nenough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor\ncan we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of\na wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is\ntravelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than\nwe are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,\nthe impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or\none-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in\ntime. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in\nwhich the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.\n\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the\nTime Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.\n\n'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'but\nwait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.'\n\n'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the Time\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the\nway down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember\nvividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,\nthe dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but\nincredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger\nedition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before\nour eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly\nbeen filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally\ncomplete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\nbench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better\nlook at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\n\n'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you perfectly serious?\nOr is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'\n\n'Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp\naloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more\nserious in my life.'\n\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\n\nI caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\nwinked at me solemnly.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who\nare too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round\nhim; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in\nambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and\nexplained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have\nshown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his\nmotives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time\nTraveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we\ndistrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less\nclever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things\ntoo easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\nquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting\ntheir reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a\nnursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very\nmuch about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and\nthe next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of\nour minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,\nthe curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it\nsuggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the\ntrick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,\nwhom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar\nthing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out\nof the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\n\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of\nthe Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found\nfour or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\nMan was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand\nand his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\nand--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I suppose\nwe'd better have dinner?'\n\n'Where's----?' said I, naming our host.\n\n'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. He\nasks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not\nback. Says he'll explain when he comes.'\n\n'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\n\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself\nwho had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the\nEditor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,\nshy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my\nobservation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was\nsome speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's\nabsence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.\nThe Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist\nvolunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we\nhad witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition\nwhen the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I\nwas facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'\nAnd the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.\nI gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'\ncried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful\nturned towards the door.\n\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and\nsmeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it\nseemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour\nhad actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown\ncut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,\nas by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,\nas if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.\nHe walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.\nWe stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\n\nHe said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a\nmotion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and\npushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:\nfor he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile\nflickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'\nsaid the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't let\nme disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\n'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took\nit off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,\nand a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over\nour faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm\nand comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling\nhis way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll\ncome down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I'm\nstarving for a bit of meat.'\n\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\nwas all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'\nsaid the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'\n\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again\nI remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,\nand standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had\nnothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the\ndoor closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered\nhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my\nmind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent\nScientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in\nheadlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright\ndinner-table.\n\n'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing the\nAmateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,\nand read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time\nTraveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else had\nnoticed his lameness.\n\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical\nMan, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants\nwaiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his\nknife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The\ndinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,\nwith gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his\ncuriosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a\ncrossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feel\nassured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up\nthe Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guests\nwere frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_\nthis time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by\nrolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to\nhim, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in\nthe Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and\njoined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole\nthing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,\nirreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Day\nafter To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather\nshouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\nordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained\nof the change that had startled me.\n\n'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you have\nbeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about\nlittle Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'\n\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a\nword. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' he\nsaid. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'\n\n'Story!' cried the Editor.\n\n'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something to\neat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.\nThanks. And the salt.'\n\n'One word,' said I. 'Have you been time travelling?'\n\n'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his\nhead.\n\n'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.\nThe Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang\nit with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been\nstaring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.\nThe rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden\nquestions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same\nwith the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by\ntelling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his\nattention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.\nThe Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller\nthrough his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than\nusual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of\nsheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\nand looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I was\nsimply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his\nhand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room.\nIt's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the\nbell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\n\n'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he\nsaid to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new\nguests.\n\n'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.\n\n'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but\nI can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what\nhas happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from\ninterruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\nlying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was in\nmy laboratory at four o'clock, and since then ... I've lived eight\ndays ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly\nworn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.\nThen I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'\n\n'Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' And\nwith that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.\nHe sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man.\nAfterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only\ntoo much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my\nown inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\nattentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,\nsincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the\nintonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed\nthe turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the\ncandles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face\nof the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees\ndownward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each\nother. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the\nTime Traveller's face.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of\nthe ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of\nit's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,\nwhen the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the\nnickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get\nremade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It\nwas at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began\nits career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put\none more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the\nsaddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels\nmuch the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took\nthe starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\npressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to\nreel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,\nI saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For\na moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted\nthe clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute\nor so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\n\n'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\nhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\ndark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing\nme, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to\ntraverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room\nlike a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The\nnight came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment\ncame to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\nand ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night\nagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled\nmy ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\n'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling\nexactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong\nmotion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent\nsmash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a\nblack wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to\nfall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,\nleaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed\nthe laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.\nI had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too\nfast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that\never crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of\ndarkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the\nintermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\nquarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling\nstars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the\npalpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;\nthe sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous\ncolor like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak\nof fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating\nband; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a\nbrighter circle flickering in the blue.\n\n'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side\nupon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me\ngrey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,\nnow brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.\nI saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.\nThe whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing\nunder my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my\nspeed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun\nbelt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or\nless, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and\nminute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and\nvanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\n\n'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked\nindeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a\nkind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At\nfirst I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but\nthese new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions\ngrew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain\ndread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What\nstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our\nrudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to\nlook nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated\nbefore my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about\nme, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\nseemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\nhill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even\nthrough the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so\nmy mind came round to the business of stopping.\n\n'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some\nsubstance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long\nas I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely\nmattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour\nthrough the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to\na stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into\nwhatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate\ncontact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical\nreaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow\nmyself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the\nUnknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I\nwas making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an\nunavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the\nrisk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.\nThe fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,\nthe sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the\nfeeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told\nmyself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I\nresolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over\nthe lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was\nflung headlong through the air.\n\n'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have\nbeen stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,\nand I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.\nEverything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the\nconfusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what\nseemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron\nbushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were\ndropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The\nrebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove\nalong the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.\n\"Fine hospitality,\" said I, \"to a man who has travelled innumerable\nyears to see you.\"\n\n'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\n\n'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail\ngrew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very\nlarge, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white\nmarble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,\ninstead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so\nthat it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of\nbronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was\ntowards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the\nfaint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,\nand that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood\nlooking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an\nhour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it\ndenser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and\nsaw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was\nlightening with the promise of the sun.\n\n'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full\ntemerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when\nthat hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have\nhappened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?\nWhat if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had\ndeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly\npowerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more\ndreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to\nbe incontinently slain.\n\n'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate\nparapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping\nin upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic\nfear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to\nreadjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the\nthunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like\nthe trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue\nof the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into\nnothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and\ndistinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out\nin white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I\nfelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in\nthe clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear\ngrew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again\ngrappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under\nmy desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One\nhand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily\nin attitude to mount again.\n\n'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer\nhouse, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had\nseen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\n\n'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by\nthe White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of\nthese emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon\nwhich I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps\nfour feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a\nleather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish\nwhich--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his\nhead was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm\nthe air was.\n\n'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more\nbeautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used\nto hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.\nI took my hands from the machine.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\nthing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my\neyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and\nspoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\n\n'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was\ntoo harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my\nears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then\ntouched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my\nback and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was\nnothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in\nthese pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful\ngentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so\nfrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them\nabout like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I\nsaw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily\nthen, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto\nforgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the\nlittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my\npocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of\ncommunication.\n\n'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some\nfurther peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.\nTheir hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the\nneck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the\nface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,\nwith bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a\npoint. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on\nmy part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the\ninterest I might have expected in them.\n\n'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood\nround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I\nbegan the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.\nThen hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the\nsun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and\nwhite followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the\nsound of thunder.\n\n'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were\nthese creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.\nYou see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight\nHundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in\nknowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a\nquestion that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of\nour five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from\nthe sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended\nupon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.\nA flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt\nthat I had built the Time Machine in vain.\n\n'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering\nof a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so\nand bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of\nbeautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.\nThe idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they\nwere all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging\nthem upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who\nhave never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and\nwonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then\nsomeone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the\nnearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,\nwhich had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my\nastonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I\nwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\nmerriment, to my mind.\n\n'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw\nover their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and\nflowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number\nof tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps\nacross the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if\nwild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine\nthem closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the\nturf among the rhododendrons.\n\n'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did\nnot observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw\nsuggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and\nit struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.\nSeveral more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we\nentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking\ngrotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an\neddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,\nin a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\n\n'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed\nwith coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered\nlight. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white\nmetal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I\njudged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply\nchannelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length\nwere innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised\nperhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.\nSome I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,\nbut for the most part they were strange.\n\n'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.\nUpon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do\nlikewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the\nfruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into\nthe round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to\nfollow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I\nsurveyed the hall at my leisure.\n\n'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.\nThe stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical\npattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung\nacross the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that\nthe corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,\nthe general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,\nperhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of\nthem, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with\ninterest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.\nAll were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.\n\n'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite\nof some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I\nfound afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\nthere--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,\nand I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange\nfruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to\nperceive their import.\n\n'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to\nmake a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of\nmine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a\nconvenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began\na series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some\nconsiderable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts\nmet with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but\npresently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention\nand repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business\nat great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the\nexquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount\nof amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,\nand persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at\nleast at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and\neven the verb \"to eat.\" But it was slow work, and the little people\nsoon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I\ndetermined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in\nlittle doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found\nthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more\neasily fatigued.\n\n'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was\ntheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of\nastonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop\nexamining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that\nalmost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is\nodd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I\nwent out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as\nmy hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men\nof the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and\nlaugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly\nway, leave me again to my own devices.\n\n'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.\nAt first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely\ndifferent from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big\nbuilding I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river\nvalley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present\nposition. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a\nmile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this\nour planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred\nand One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little\ndials of my machine recorded.\n\n'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I\nfound the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for\ninstance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of\naluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled\nheaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like\nplants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about\nthe leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict\nremains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not\ndetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have\na very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger\ndiscovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.\n\n'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I\nrested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be\nseen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,\nhad vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like\nbuildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such\ncharacteristic features of our own English landscape, had\ndisappeared.\n\n'\"Communism,\" said I to myself.\n\n'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,\nI perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft\nhairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem\nstrange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything\nwas so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and\nin all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the\nsexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And\nthe children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their\nparents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were\nextremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards\nabundant verification of my opinion.\n\n'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I\nfelt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what\none would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a\nwoman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of\noccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical\nforce; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing\nbecomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where\nviolence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less\nnecessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,\nand the specialization of the sexes with reference to their\nchildren's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even\nin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I\nmust remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to\nappreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\n\n'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by\na pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in\na transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then\nresumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings\ntowards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\n\n'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered\nin soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of\ngriffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of\nour old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and\nfair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the\nhorizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal\nbars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in\nwhich the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already\nspoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated\ngreenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose\na white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and\nthere came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There\nwere no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of\nagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\n\n'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation\nwas something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a\nhalf-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\n\n'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.\nThe ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the\nfirst time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social\neffort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,\nit is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;\nsecurity sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the\nconditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more\nand more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a\nunited humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are\nnow mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and\ncarried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!\n\n'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still\nin the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but\na little department of the field of human disease, but even so,\nit spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our\nagriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and\ncultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the\ngreater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our\nfavourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by\nselective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless\ngrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed\nof cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague\nand tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,\ntoo, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will\nbe better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the\ncurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,\neducated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster\ntowards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully\nwe shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit\nour human needs.\n\n'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine\nhad leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or\nfungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;\nbrilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of\npreventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I\nsaw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I\nshall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction\nand decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\n\n'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social\nnor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all\nthat commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It\nwas natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of\na social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been\nmet, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\n\n'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to\nthe change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is\nthe cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and\nthe weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the\nloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and\ndecision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that\narise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,\nparental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in\nthe imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent\ndangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against\nconnubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion\nof all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us\nuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant\nlife.\n\n'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which\nit lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\n\n'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.\nEven in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary\nto survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and\nthe love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be\nhindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance\nand security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out\nof place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of\nwar or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting\ndisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For\nsuch a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as\nthe strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they\nare, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there\nwas no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw\nwas the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy\nof mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the\nconditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which\nbegan the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in\nsecurity; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor\nand decay.\n\n'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died\nin the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to\nsing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and\nno more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented\ninactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and\nnecessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful\ngrindstone broken at last!\n\n'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this\nsimple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered\nthe whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they\nhad devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,\nand their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.\nThat would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my\nexplanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the\nfull moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver\nlight in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move\nabout below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the\nchill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could\nsleep.\n\n'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to\nthe figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see\nthe silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron\nbushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.\nI looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.\n\"No,\" said I stoutly to myself, \"that was not the lawn.\"\n\n'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came\nhome to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\n\n'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of\nlosing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.\nThe bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could\nfeel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another\nmoment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping\nstrides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost\nno time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a\nwarm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying\nto myself: \"They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes\nout of the way.\" Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the\ntime, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,\nI knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the\nmachine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I\nsuppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the\nlittle lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young\nman. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the\nmachine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none\nanswered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\nworld.\n\n'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace\nof the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the\nempty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it\nfuriously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then\nstopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered\nthe sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in\nthe light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my\ndismay.\n\n'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put\nthe mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of\ntheir physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed\nme: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose\nintervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt\nassured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,\nthe machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the\nlevers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from\ntampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,\nand was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\n\n'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running\nviolently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,\nand startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a\nsmall deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes\nwith my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding\nfrom the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of\nmind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was\ndark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell\nover one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a\nmatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\n\n'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon\nwhich, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I\nhave no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming\nsuddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the\nsplutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.\n\"Where is my Time Machine?\" I began, bawling like an angry child,\nlaying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have\nbeen very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely\nfrightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head\nthat I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do\nunder the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.\nFor, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear\nmust be forgotten.\n\n'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people\nover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,\nout under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little\nfeet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all\nI did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected\nnature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from\nmy own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved\nto and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory\nof horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of\nlooking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit\nruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,\nof lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute\nwretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when\nI woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping\nround me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n\n'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how\nI had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion\nand despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,\nreasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the\nface. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could\nreason with myself. \"Suppose the worst?\" I said. \"Suppose the\nmachine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be\ncalm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear\nidea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials\nand tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.\" That\nwould be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after\nall, it was a beautiful and curious world.\n\n'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must\nbe calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force\nor cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about\nme, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and\ntravel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal\nfreshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about\nmy business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement\novernight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the\nlittle lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as\nwell as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They\nall failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\nthought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in\nthe world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was\na foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger\nwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.\nThe turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about\nmidway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet\nwhere, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\nThere were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow\nfootprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed\nmy closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,\nof bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\nframed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The\npedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them\ndiscontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,\nbut possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened\nfrom within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very\ngreat mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\npedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\n\n'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\nsmiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,\npointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open\nit. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I\ndon't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were\nto use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is\nhow she would look. They went off as if they had received the last\npossible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,\nwith exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel\nashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and\nI tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper\ngot the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by\nthe loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him\ntowards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his\nface, and all of a sudden I let him go.\n\n'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze\npanels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,\nI thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been\nmistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and\nhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the\nverdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people\nmust have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on\neither hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the\nslopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down\nto watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\nOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,\nbut to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.\n\n'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the\nbushes towards the hill again. \"Patience,\" said I to myself. \"If you\nwant your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they\nmean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their\nbronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as\nyou can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a\npuzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this\nworld. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses\nat its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.\" Then\nsuddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought\nof the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future\nage, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made\nmyself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a\nman devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help\nmyself. I laughed aloud.\n\n'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little\npeople avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had\nsomething to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt\ntolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no\nconcern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course\nof a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what\nprogress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my\nexplorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or\ntheir language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed\nof concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,\nabstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\nsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to\nconvey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined\nto put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze\ndoors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,\nuntil my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural\nway. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a\ncircle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\n\n'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\nrichness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the\nsame abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material\nand style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\nblossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and\nso faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which\npresently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain\ncircular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.\nOne lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my\nfirst walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\nwrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by\nthe side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,\nI could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection\nwith a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:\na thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I\ndiscovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of\nair set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the\nthroat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at\nonce sucked swiftly out of sight.\n\n'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was\noften just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above\na sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\n\n'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and\nbells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my\ntime in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and\ncoming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail\nabout building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while\nsuch details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is\ncontained in one's imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to\na real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the\ntale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take\nback to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of\nsocial movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels\nDelivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,\nshould be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of\nwhat he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either\napprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro\nand a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between\nmyself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was\nunseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general\nimpression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very\nlittle of the difference to your mind.\n\n'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\nbeyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make\na further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm\namong this people there were none.\n\n'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\nautomatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.\nYet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The\nseveral big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great\ndining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no\nappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant\nfabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though\nundecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow\nsuch things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige\nof a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign\nof importations among them. They spent all their time in playing\ngently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful\nfashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things\nwere kept going.\n\n'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,\nhad taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For\nthe life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,\nthose flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall\nI put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and\nthere in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others\nmade up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,\non the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight\nHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to\nme!\n\n'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I\nwas watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of\nthem was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main\ncurrent ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate\nswimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange\ndeficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the\nslightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which\nwas drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly\nslipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I\ncaught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of\nthe limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of\nseeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low\nestimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.\nIn that, however, I was wrong.\n\n'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little\nwoman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre\nfrom an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and\npresented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me\nand me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had\nbeen feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my\nappreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little\nstone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The\ncreature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have\ndone. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did\nthe same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was\nWeena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed\nappropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\nwhich lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!\n\n'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about\nit went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,\nexhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems\nof the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come\ninto the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress\nwhen I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting\nwere sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much\ntrouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,\na very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that\nmade her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know\nwhat I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too\nlate did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely\nseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she\ncared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return\nto the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of\ncoming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold\nso soon as I came over the hill.\n\n'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the\noddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made\nthreatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she\ndreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness\nto her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate\nemotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,\namong other things, that these little people gathered into the great\nhouses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a\nlight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found\none out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.\nYet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that\nfear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping away\nfrom these slumbering multitudes.\n\n'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including\nthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.\nBut my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been\nthe night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had\nbeen restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and\nthat sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.\nI woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal\nhad just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,\nbut I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour\nwhen things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is\ncolourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down\ninto the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the\npalace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the\nsunrise.\n\n'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor\nof dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky\nblack, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.\nAnd up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,\nas I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw\na solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the\nhill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some\ndark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.\nIt seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still\nindistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,\nuncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted\nmy eyes.\n\n'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on\nand its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned\nthe view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were\nmere creatures of the half light. \"They must have been ghosts,\" I\nsaid; \"I wonder whence they dated.\" For a queer notion of Grant\nAllen's came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and\nleave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with\nthem. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight\nHundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four\nat once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these\nfigures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my\nhead. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal\nI had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.\nBut Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were\nsoon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\n\n'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather\nof this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun\nwas hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that\nthe sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,\nunfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,\nforget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into\nthe parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze\nwith renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had\nsuffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the\nsun was very much hotter than we know it.\n\n'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking\nshelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great\nhouse where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:\nClambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,\nwhose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.\nBy contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first\nimpenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from\nlight to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I\nhalted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against\nthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\n\n'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched\nmy hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was\nafraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which\nhumanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I\nremembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to\nsome extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my\nvoice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched\nsomething soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something\nwhite ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a\nqueer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar\nmanner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered\nagainst a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was\nhidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.\n\n'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a\ndull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there\nwas flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it\nwent too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it\nran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an\ninstant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could\nnot find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I\ncame upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told\nyou, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.\nCould this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,\nlooking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large\nbright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made\nme shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down\nthe wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot\nand hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the\nlight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it\ndropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had\ndisappeared.\n\n'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that\nMan had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two\ndistinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were\nnot the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,\nobscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir\nto all the ages.\n\n'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an\nunderground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And\nwhat, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly\nbalanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity\nof the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,\nat the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling\nmyself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there\nI must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I\nwas absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful\nUpper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the\ndaylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging\nflowers at her as he ran.\n\n'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form\nto remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried\nto frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more\nvisibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my\nmatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about\nthe well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to\ngo back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was\nalready in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and\nsliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these\nwells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to\nsay nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the\nfate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion\ntowards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\n\n'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which\nmade me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome\nof a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was\nthe bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the\ndark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,\nthose large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are\ncommon features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.\nAnd last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty\nyet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar\ncarriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory\nof an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.\n\n'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in\nfact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in\nthis artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the\ncomfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible\nthat I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this\nsplitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the\nshape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it\nfell far short of the truth.\n\n'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed\nclear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present\nmerely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and\nthe Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will\nseem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even\nnow there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is\na tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental\npurposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in\nLondon, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are\nsubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they\nincrease and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had\nincreased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the\nsky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever\nlarger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of\nits time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end\nworker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut\noff from the natural surface of the earth?\n\n'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to\nthe increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf\nbetween them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading\nto the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the\nsurface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the\nprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same\nwidening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher\neducational process and the increased facilities for and temptations\ntowards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that\nexchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage\nwhich at present retards the splitting of our species along lines\nof social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,\nabove ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort\nand beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting\ncontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they\nwere there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little\nof it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,\nthey would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were\nso constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in\nthe end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as\nwell adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in\ntheir way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to\nme, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally\nenough.\n\n'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different\nshape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and\ngeneral co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real\naristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical\nconclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been\nsimply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the\nfellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had\nno convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My\nexplanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the\nmost plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced\ncivilization that was at last attained must have long since passed\nits zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect\nsecurity of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of\ndegeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\nhappened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what\nI had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which\nthese creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification\nof the human type was even far more profound than among the \"Eloi,\"\nthe beautiful race that I already knew.\n\n'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if\nthe Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And\nwhy were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have\nsaid, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the\ntopic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little\nharshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my\nown, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased\nabruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in\nbanishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.\nAnd very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I\nsolemnly burned a match.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow\nup the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt\na peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\nspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic\ninfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began\nto appreciate.\n\n'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a\nlittle disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once\nor twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive\nno definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great\nhall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that\nnight Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.\nIt occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the\nmoon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,\nwhen the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these\nwhitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be\nmore abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of\none who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time\nMachine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these\nunderground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I\nhad had a companion it would have been different. But I was so\nhorribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the\nwell appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling,\nbut I never felt quite safe at my back.\n\n'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\nfurther and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\nWood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any\nI had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces\nor ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face\nof it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind\nof bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This\ndifference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded\nto push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come\nupon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I\nresolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I\nreturned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next\nmorning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the\nPalace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable\nme to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I\nwould make the descent without further waste of time, and started\nout in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite\nand aluminium.\n\n'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but\nwhen she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed\nstrangely disconcerted. \"Good-bye, little Weena,\" I said, kissing\nher; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet\nfor the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for\nI feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in\namazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she\nbegan to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition\nnerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little\nroughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I\nsaw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.\nThen I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.\n\n'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from\nthe sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of\na creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily\ncramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of\nthe bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into\nthe blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after\nthat experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and\nback were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the\nsheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,\nI saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,\nwhile little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. The\nthudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.\nEverything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when\nI looked up again Weena had disappeared.\n\n'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go\nup the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while\nI turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with\nintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a\nslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and\nrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the\nshaft.\n\n'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching\nmy face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar\nto the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating\nbefore the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me\nimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and\nsensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they\nreflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see\nme in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear\nof me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in\norder to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark\ngutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the\nstrangest fashion.\n\n'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\ndifferent from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs\nleft to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before\nexploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, \"You are\nin for it now,\" and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the\nnoise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from\nme, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,\nsaw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into\nutter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it\nwas as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\n\n'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,\nwas very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly\nshed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a\nlittle table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The\nMorlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember\nwondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red\njoint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big\nunmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and\nonly waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match\nburned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot\nin the blackness.\n\n'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such\nan experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had\nstarted with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would\ncertainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.\nI had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to\nsmoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough\nmatches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that\nglimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.\nBut, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers\nthat Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and\nfour safety-matches that still remained to me.\n\n'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the\ndark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered\nthat my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me\nuntil that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I\nhad wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to\nwhom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I\nstood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling\nover my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I\nfancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little\nbeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently\ndisengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The\nsense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably\nunpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of\nthinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I\nshouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then\nI could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more\nboldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,\nand shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so\nseriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came\nback at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined\nto strike another match and escape under the protection of its\nglare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper\nfrom my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I\nhad scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the\nblackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,\nand pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\n\n'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another\nlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine\nhow nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces\nand great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their\nblindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise\nyou: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck\nmy third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening\ninto the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great\npump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting\nhooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I\nwas violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it\nincontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,\nand, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the\nMorlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed\npeering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who\nfollowed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\n\n'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or\nthirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest\ndifficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful\nstruggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I\nfelt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the\nwell-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding\nsunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.\nThen I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of\nothers among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,\nexcept during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,\nI had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was\nstaggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought\nmyself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and\nby some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;\nbut there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of\nthe Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I\nloathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen\ninto a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.\nNow I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him\nsoon.\n\n'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the\nnew moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first\nincomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now\nsuch a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights\nmight mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer\ninterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at\nleast the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for\nthe dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that\nthe Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that\nmy second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might\nonce have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their\nmechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding\ndown towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new\nrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed\nto a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on\nsufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable\ngenerations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\nintolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\nmaintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the\nsurvival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse\npaws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:\nbecause ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the\norganism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of\nthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back\nchanged! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.\nThey were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came\ninto my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.\nIt seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it\nwere by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a\nquestion from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a\nvague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was\nat the time.\n\n'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this\nage of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not\nparalyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend\nmyself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a\nfastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could\nface this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in\nrealizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt\nI could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I\nshuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined\nme.\n\n'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All\nthe buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished\ngleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,\ntaking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills\ntowards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or\neight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen\nthe place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively\ndiminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and\na nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes\nI wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long\npast sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black\nagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\n\n'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but\nafter a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the\nside of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers\nto stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at\nthe last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase\nfor floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.\nAnd that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'\n\nThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and\nsilently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white\nmallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.\n\n'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over\nthe hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to\nreturn to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant\npinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to\nmake her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her\nFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the\ndusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an\nair of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,\nremote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the\nsunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my\nfears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally\nsharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground\nbeneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks\non their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.\nIn my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of\ntheir burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my\nTime Machine?\n\n'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.\nThe clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another\ncame out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears and\nher fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her\nand caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her\narms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face\nagainst my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and\nthere in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I\nwaded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number\nof sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,\n_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of\nthe Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours\nbefore the old moon rose were still to come.\n\n'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide\nand black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to\nit, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in\nparticular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my\nshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no\nlonger see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my\ndirection. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of\nwhat it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would\nbe out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking\ndanger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose\nupon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the\ntree-boles to strike against.\n\n'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I\ndecided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the\nopen hill.\n\n'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her\nin my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\nhill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood\nthere came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the\nstars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of\nfriendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations\nhad gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is\nimperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since\nrearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it\nseemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as\nof yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that\nwas new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.\nAnd amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet\nshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\n\n'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all\nthe gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of\nthe unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great\nprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty\ntimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that\nI had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,\nall the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,\nlanguages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as\nI knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these\nfrail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white\nThings of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear\nthat was between the two species, and for the first time, with a\nsudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen\nmight be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping\nbeside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and\nforthwith dismissed the thought.\n\n'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as\nI could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find\nsigns of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept\nvery clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at\ntimes. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward\nsky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon\nrose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking\nit, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then\ngrowing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had\nseen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed\nday it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I\nstood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle\nand painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,\nand flung them away.\n\n'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit\nwherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,\nlaughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such\nthing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the\nmeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from\nthe bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great\nflood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human\ndecay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on\nrats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating\nand exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His\nprejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so\nthese inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a\nscientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote\nthan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.\nAnd the intelligence that would have made this state of things a\ntorment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere\nfatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed\nupon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing\nat my side!\n\n'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming\nupon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human\nselfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon\nthe labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword\nand excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to\nhim. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy\nin decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great\ntheir intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the\nhuman form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a\nsharer in their degradation and their Fear.\n\n'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should\npursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to\nmake myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That\nnecessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some\nmeans of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,\nfor nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.\nThen I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of\nbronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had\na persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of\nlight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I\ncould not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far\naway. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And\nturning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the\nbuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high\nupon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I\nwas surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though\nI never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or\nmight be happening, to the living things in the sea.\n\n'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might\nhelp me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of\nwriting had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I\nfancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so\nhuman.\n\n'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we\nfound, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many\nside windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.\nThe tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of\nmiscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then\nI perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,\nwhat was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized\nby the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the\nfashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay\nbeside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had\ndropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn\naway. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a\nBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the\nside I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away\nthe thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own\ntime. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\npreservation of some of their contents.\n\n'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South\nKensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,\nand a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the\ninevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and\nhad, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine\nhundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if\nwith extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and\nthere I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare\nfossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the\ncases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as\nI judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our\nfootsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping\nglass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very\nquietly took my hand and stood beside me.\n\n'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\nintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\nlittle from my mind.\n\n'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;\npossibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,\nat least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more\ninteresting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.\nExploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the\nfirst. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a\nblock of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find\nno saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had\ndeliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a\ntrain of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,\nthough on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had\nlittle interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on\ndown a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had\nentered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural\nhistory, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A\nfew shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed\nanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a\nbrown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,\nbecause I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by\nwhich the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we\ncame to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly\nill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the\nend at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the\nceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in\nmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of\nbig machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some\nstill fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for\nmechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as\nfor the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make\nonly the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if\nI could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of\npowers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\n\n'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It\nmay be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum\nwas built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at\nwas quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As\nyou went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,\nuntil at last there was a pit like the \"area\" of a London house\nbefore each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went\nslowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent\nupon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until\nWeena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that\nthe gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and\nthen, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant\nand its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it\nappeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My\nsense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.\nI felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of\nmachinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the\nafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means\nof making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the\ngallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\nheard down the well.\n\n'I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her\nand turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike\nthose in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this\nlever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly\nWeena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged\nthe strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a\nminute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than\nsufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I\nlonged very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may\nthink, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was\nimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my\ndisinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to\nslake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained\nme from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I\nheard.\n\n'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first\nglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.\nThe brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I\npresently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had\nlong since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left\nthem. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic\nclasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I\nmight, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\nBut as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the\nenormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting\npaper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly\nof the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon\nphysical optics.\n\n'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have\nbeen a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little\nhope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had\ncollapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every\nunbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,\nI found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were\nperfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. \"Dance,\"\nI cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed\nagainst the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict\nmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge\ndelight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling\n_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a\nmodest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far\nas my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally\ninventive, as you know.\n\n'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped\nthe wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for\nme it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far\nunlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed\njar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.\nI fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass\naccordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the\nuniversal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,\nperhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a\nsepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil\nBelemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions\nof years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that\nit was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in\nfact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no\nexplosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze\ndoors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had\nchanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\n\n'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all\nthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of\narms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a\nsword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised\nbest against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,\nand rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some\nnew metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder\nthere may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was\ncharred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the\nspecimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,\nMexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.\nAnd here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon\nthe nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly\ntook my fancy.\n\n'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes\nmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I\nsuddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the\nmerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\ncartridges! I shouted \"Eureka!\" and smashed the case with joy. Then\ncame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,\nI made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in\nwaiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.\nOf course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from\ntheir presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should\nhave rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and\n(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together\ninto non-existence.\n\n'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court\nwithin the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we\nrested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider\nour position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible\nhiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little\nnow. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of\nall defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor\nin my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that\nthe best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,\nprotected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the\nTime Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But\nnow, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards\nthose bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,\nlargely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never\nimpressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of\niron not altogether inadequate for the work.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above\nthe horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the\nnext morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods\nthat had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as\nfar as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep\nin the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I\ngathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms\nfull of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had\nanticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the\nwood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,\nfearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending\ncalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me\nonward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was\nfeverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the\nMorlocks with it.\n\n'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim\nagainst their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was\nscrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from\ntheir insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather\nless than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare\nhill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer\nresting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could\ncontrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was\nevident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should\nhave to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.\nAnd then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind\nby lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this\nproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering\nour retreat.\n\n'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must\nbe in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's\nheat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by\ndewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.\nLightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to\nwidespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with\nthe heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In\nthis decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on\nthe earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were\nan altogether new and strange thing to Weena.\n\n'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,\nand in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the\nwood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking\nback presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my\nheap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a\ncurved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed\nat that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very\nblack, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as\nmy eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to\navoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of\nremote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of\nmy matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my\nlittle one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\n\n'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\npattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had\nheard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the\nMorlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another\nminute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena\nshivered violently, and became quite still.\n\n'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did\nso, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the\ndarkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the\nsame peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,\ntoo, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.\nThen the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the\nwhite backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took\na lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon\nas the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying\nclutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.\nWith a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to\nbreathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,\nand as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the\nshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\nthe stir and murmur of a great company!\n\n'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder\nand rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In\nmanoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about\nseveral times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction\nlay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the\nPalace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to\nthink rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp\nwhere we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy\nbole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began\ncollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness\nround me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.\n\n'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\ndismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece\nof camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed\nhow dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival\non the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,\ninstead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\nleaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking\nsmoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my\ncamphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I\ntried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could\nnot even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n\n'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\nmade me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in\nthe air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I\nfelt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was\nfull of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just\nto nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had\ntheir hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily\nfelt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they\ngripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had\nhappened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness\nof death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of\nburning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\nand pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to\nfeel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in\na monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt\nlittle teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my\nhand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled\nup, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,\nI thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\nsucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment\nI was free.\n\n'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\nfighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\ndetermined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my\nback to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was\nfull of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices\nseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements\ngrew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the\nblackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were\nafraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The\ndarkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the\nMorlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,\nwith incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\nincessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the\nwood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap\nof starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I\nunderstood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was\ngrowing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'\nflight.\n\n'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through\nthe black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning\nforest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for\nWeena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the\nexplosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little\ntime for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the\nMorlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward\nso swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to\nstrike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open\nspace, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and\npast me, and went on straight into the fire!\n\n'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\nall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright\nas day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock\nor tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was\nanother arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already\nwrithing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of\nfire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled\nby the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against\neach other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their\nblindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of\nfear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.\nBut when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the\nhawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured\nof their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck\nno more of them.\n\n'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one\ntime the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures\nwould presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the\nfight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the\nfire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about\nthe hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of\nWeena. But Weena was gone.\n\n'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and\nmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat\non them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and\nthrough the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they\nbelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three\nMorlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows\nof my fists, trembling as I did so.\n\n'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.\nI bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat\nthe ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and\nwandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to\nrubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw\nMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the\nflames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the\nstreaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening\ntree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,\ncame the white light of the day.\n\n'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I\ncannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the\nawful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was\nalmost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about\nme, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind\nof island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out\nthrough a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that\nI could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the\nremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and\nmoaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet\nand limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still\npulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time\nMachine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as\nlame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death\nof little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this\nold familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an\nactual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely\nagain--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of\nthis fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing\nthat was pain.\n\n'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning\nsky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose\nmatches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of\nyellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of\nmy arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and\ncould not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here\nwas the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same\nsplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river\nrunning between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful\npeople moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing\nin exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave\nme a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the\ncupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all\nthe beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their\nday, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the\ncattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And\ntheir end was the same.\n\n'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had\nbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly\ntowards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and\npermanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come\nto this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost\nabsolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and\ncomfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that\nperfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social\nquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\n\n'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility\nis the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal\nperfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.\nNature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are\nuseless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no\nneed of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have\nto meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\n\n'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his\nfeeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.\nBut that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical\nperfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the\nfeeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become\ndisjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a\nfew thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The\nUnder-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,\nstill needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained\nperforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human\ncharacter, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they\nturned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it\nin my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven\nHundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit\ncould invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I\ngive it to you.\n\n'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and\nin spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm\nsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon\nmy theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my\nown hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\nrefreshing sleep.\n\n'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being\ncaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on\ndown the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one\nhand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\n\n'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal\nof the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid\ndown into grooves.\n\n'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\n\n'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner\nof this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.\nSo here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the\nWhite Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost\nsorry not to use it.\n\n'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the\nbronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it\nhad been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that\nthe Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in\ntheir dim way to grasp its purpose.\n\n'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere\ntouch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The\nbronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.\nI was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I\nchuckled gleefully.\n\n'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards\nme. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on\nthe levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one\nlittle thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light\nonly on the box.\n\n'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were\nclose upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at\nthem with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the\nmachine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had\nsimply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and\nat the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,\nindeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,\nI had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's\nskull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in\nthe forest, I think, this last scramble.\n\n'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging\nhands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.\nI found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already\ndescribed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\n'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes\nwith time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the\nsaddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite\ntime I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite\nunheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials\nagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records\ndays, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and\nanother thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,\nI had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I\ncame to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was\nsweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into\nfuturity.\n\n'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of\nthings. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was\nstill travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession\nof day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,\nreturned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much\nat first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,\nand so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed\nto stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over\nthe earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared\nacross the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the\nsun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it\nsimply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more\nred. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,\ngrowing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of\nlight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very\nlarge, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with\na dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At\none time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,\nbut it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this\nslowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal\ndrag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,\neven as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,\nfor I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse\nmy motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the\nthousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a\nmere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a\ndesolate beach grew visible.\n\n'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,\nand out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale\nwhite stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and\nsouth-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by\nthe horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The\nrocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of\nlife that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation\nthat covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It\nwas the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the\nlichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual\ntwilight.\n\n'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away\nto the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the\nwan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of\nwind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a\ngentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving\nand living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was\na thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a\nsense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing\nvery fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of\nmountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied\nthan it is now.\n\n'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a\nthing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into\nthe sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The\nsound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself\nmore firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,\nquite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving\nslowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous\ncrab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,\nwith its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws\nswaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling,\nand its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic\nfront? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,\nand a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see\nthe many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it\nmoved.\n\n'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt\na tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna\nof another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes\nwere wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with\nappetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,\nwere descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and\nI had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was\nstill on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I\nstopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the\nsombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\n\n'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over\nthe world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt\nDead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring\nmonsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous\nplants, the thin air that hurts one's lungs: all contributed to an\nappalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same\nred sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the\nsame chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in\nand out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward\nsky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\n\n'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth's fate,\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller\nin the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At\nlast, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of\nthe sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling\nheavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of\ncrabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green\nliverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with\nwhite. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again\ncame eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay\nunder the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating\ncrest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the\nsea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse\nof that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still\nunfrozen.\n\n'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A\nshallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded\nfrom the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about\nupon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I\njudged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was\nmerely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed\nto me to twinkle very little.\n\n'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun\nhad changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I\nsaw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this\nblackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that\nan eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was\npassing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be\nthe moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I\nreally saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to\nthe earth.\n\n'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening\ngusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air\nincreased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and\nwhisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?\nIt would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of\nman, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,\nthe stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.\nAs the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,\ndancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At\nlast, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of\nthe distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a\nmoaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping\ntowards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All\nelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\n\n'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote\nto my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I\nshivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow\nin the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to\nrecover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return\njourney. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing\nupon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving\nthing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the\nsize of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles\ntrailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I\nwas fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote\nand awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\n'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon\nthe machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was\nresumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with\ngreater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and\nflowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again\nthe dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.\nThese, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the\nmillion dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize\nour own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back\nto the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower.\nThen the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,\nnow, I slowed the mechanism down.\n\n'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told\nyou that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.\nWatchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,\nlike a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when\nshe traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to\nbe the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower\nend opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,\nand disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.\nJust before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed\nlike a flash.\n\n'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got\noff the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several\nminutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was\nmy old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept\nthere, and the whole thing have been a dream.\n\n'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east\ncorner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the\nnorth-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the\nexact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White\nSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\n\n'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came\nthrough the passage here, limping, because my heel was still\npainful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_\non the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and\nlooking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. I\nheard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so\nsick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the\ndoor on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am\ntelling you the story.\n\n'I know,' he said, after a pause, 'that all this will be absolutely\nincredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here\nto-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces\nand telling you these strange adventures.'\n\nHe looked at the Medical Man. 'No. I cannot expect you to believe\nit. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the\nworkshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our\nrace until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its\ntruth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking\nit as a story, what do you think of it?'\n\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\ncarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and looked\nround at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of\ncolour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the\ncontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end\nof his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The\nothers, as far as I remember, were motionless.\n\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh. 'What a pity it is you're not\na writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the Time\nTraveller's shoulder.\n\n'You don't believe it?'\n\n'Well----'\n\n'I thought not.'\n\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. 'Where are the matches?' he said.\nHe lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. 'To tell you the truth\n... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...'\n\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers\nupon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his\npipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his\nknuckles.\n\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.\n'The gynaeceum's odd,' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to\nsee, holding out his hand for a specimen.\n\n'I'm hanged if it isn't a quarter to one,' said the Journalist.\n'How shall we get home?'\n\n'Plenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychologist.\n\n'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don't\nknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?'\n\nThe Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: 'Certainly not.'\n\n'Where did you really get them?' said the Medical Man.\n\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who\nwas trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were put\ninto my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He stared\nround the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and you\nand the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I\never make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all\nonly a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at\ntimes--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. And\nwhere did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If\nthere is one!'\n\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through\nthe door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering\nlight of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and\naskew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering\nquartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail\nof it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of\ngrass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\nalong the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I\ntold you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in the\ncold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we\nreturned to the smoking-room.\n\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his\ncoat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain\nhesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he\nlaughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling\ngood night.\n\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'\nFor my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was\nso fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I\nlay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go\nnext day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the\nlaboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.\nThe laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the\nTime Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the\nsquat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the\nwind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer\nreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to\nmeddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me\nin the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small\ncamera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when\nhe saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'\nsaid he, 'with that thing in there.'\n\n'But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel through\ntime?'\n\n'Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half an\nhour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you.\nThere's some magazines here. If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove you\nthis time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'll\nforgive my leaving you now?'\n\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of\nthe laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily\npaper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly\nI was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet\nRichardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw\nthat I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the\npassage to tell the Time Traveller.\n\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,\noddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air\nwhirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the\nsound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was\nnot there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in\na whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so\ntransparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was\nabsolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.\nThe Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the\nfurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,\napparently, just been blown in.\n\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\nand the man-servant appeared.\n\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----\ngone out that way?' said I.\n\n'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\nhere.'\n\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I\nstayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,\nperhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he\nwould bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must\nwait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,\nas everybody knows now, he has never returned.\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the\nphrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral\nreef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did\nhe go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still\nmen, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome\nproblems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own\npart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,\nfragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminating\ntime! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been\ndiscussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought\nbut cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the\ngrowing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must\ninevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that\nis so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me\nthe future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a\nfew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for\nmy comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and\nflat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had\ngone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart\nof man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H.

(Herbert George) Wells\n\nRelease Date: October 2, 2004 [EBook #35]\n[Last updated: October 3, 2014]\n\nLanguage: English\n\n\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TIME MACHINE ***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Time Machine, by H. G. Wells [1898]\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)\nwas expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The\nfire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent\nlights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and\npassed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and\n",
      "caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that\nluxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully\nfree of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this\nway--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily\nadmired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)\nand his fecundity.\n\n'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two\nideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for\ninstance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.'\n\n'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?'\nsaid Filby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable\nground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You\nknow of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,\nhas no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a\nmathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.'\n\n'That is all right,' said the Psychologist.\n\n'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\n",
      "real existence.'\n\n'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All\nreal things--'\n\n'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_\ncube exist?'\n\n'Don't follow you,' said Filby.\n\n'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real\nexistence?'\n\nFilby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any\nreal body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have\nLength, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,\nthree which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.\nThere is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between\nthe former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that\nour consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the\nlatter from the beginning to the end of our lives.'\n\n'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight\nhis cigar over the lamp; 'that... very clear indeed.'\n\n'Now,",
      " it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,'\ncontinued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of\ncheerfulness. 'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,\nthough some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know\nthey mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is\nno difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space\nexcept that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish\npeople have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all\nheard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'\n\n'_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor.\n\n'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to\nthree planes, each at right angles to the others. But some\nphilosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions\nparticularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other\nthree?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.\nProfessor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York\nMathematical Society only a month or so ago.",
      " You know how on a flat\nsurface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of\na three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models\nof three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could\nmaster the perspective of the thing. See?'\n\n'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his\nbrows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one\nwho repeats mystic words. 'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said after\nsome time, brightening in a quite transitory manner.\n\n'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this\ngeometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results\nare curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight\nyears old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at\ntwenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it\nwere, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned\nbeing, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.\n\n'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that\nTime is only a kind of Space.",
      " Here is a popular scientific diagram,\na weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the\nmovement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night\nit fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to\nhere. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the\ndimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced\nsuch a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along\nthe Time-Dimension.'\n\n'But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'if\nTime is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why\nhas it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot\nwe move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. 'Are you sure we can move freely in\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two\ndimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.'\n\n'Not exactly,' said the Medical Man. 'There are balloons.'\n\n'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface,",
      " man had no freedom of vertical\nmovement.'\n\n'Still they could move a little up and down,' said the Medical Man.\n\n'Easier, far easier down than up.'\n\n'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\npresent moment.'\n\n'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where\nthe whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the\npresent moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have\nno dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform\nvelocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.'\n\n'But the great difficulty is this,' interrupted the Psychologist.\n'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot\nmove about in Time.'\n\n'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say\nthat we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling\nan incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:\nI become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of\ncourse we have no means of staying back for any length of Time,",
      " any\nmore than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the\nground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this\nrespect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why\nshould he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or\naccelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about\nand travel the other way?'\n\n'Oh, _this_,' began Filby, 'is all--'\n\n'Why not?' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'It's against reason,' said Filby.\n\n'What reason?' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you will\nnever convince me.'\n\n'Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller. 'But now you begin to see\nthe object of my investigations into the geometry of Four\nDimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--'\n\n'To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,\nas the driver determines.'\n\nFilby contented himself with laughter.\n\n'But I have experimental verification,' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,' the\n",
      "Psychologist suggested. 'One might travel back and verify the\naccepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!'\n\n'Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man.\n'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.'\n\n'One might get one's Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,'\nthe Very Young Man thought.\n\n'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.\nThe German scholars have improved Greek so much.'\n\n'Then there is the future,' said the Very Young Man. 'Just think!\nOne might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate at\ninterest, and hurry on ahead!'\n\n'To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communistic\nbasis.'\n\n'Of all the wild extravagant theories!' began the Psychologist.\n\n'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--'\n\n'Experimental verification!' cried I. 'You are going to verify\n_that_?'\n\n'The experiment!' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary.\n\n'Let's see your experiment anyhow,' said the Psychologist, 'though\nit's all humbug, you know.'\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled round at us.",
      " Then, still smiling faintly,\nand with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly\nout of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long\npassage to his laboratory.\n\nThe Psychologist looked at us. 'I wonder what he's got?'\n\n'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,' said the Medical Man, and\nFilby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but\nbefore he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and\nFilby's anecdote collapsed.\n\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering\nmetallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very\ndelicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent\ncrystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that\nfollows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely\nunaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that\nwere scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with\ntwo legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.\nThen he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the\n",
      "table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon\nthe model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in\nbrass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that\nthe room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair\nnearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between\nthe Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking\nover his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched\nhim in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The\nVery Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the\nalert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however\nsubtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played\nupon us under these conditions.\n\nThe Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'\nsaid the Psychologist.\n\n'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows\nupon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,\n'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through\ntime. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there\n",
      "is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in\nsome way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,\nhere is one little white lever, and here is another.'\n\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\n'It's beautifully made,' he said.\n\n'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when\nwe had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now I\nwant you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,\nsends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses\nthe motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.\nPresently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will\ngo. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a\ngood look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy\nyourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,\nand then be told I'm a quack.'\n\nThere was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\nhis finger towards the lever.",
      " 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your\nhand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's\nhand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it\nwas the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine\non its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am\nabsolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of\nwind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel\nwas blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became\nindistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of\nfaintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save\nfor the lamp the table was bare.\n\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked\nunder the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.\n'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,\ngetting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his\nback to us began to fill his pipe.\n\nWe stared at each other.",
      " 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you\nin earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine\nhas travelled into time?'\n\n'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at\nthe fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the\nPsychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not\nunhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)\n'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he\nindicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to\nhave a journey on my own account.'\n\n'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'\nsaid Filby.\n\n'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'\n\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must have\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said.\n\n'Why?' said the Time Traveller.\n\n'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it\ntravelled into the future it would still be here all this time,\nsince it must have travelled through this time.'\n\n'But,' I said,",
      " 'If it travelled into the past it would have been\nvisible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we\nwere here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'\n\n'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of\nimpartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller.\n\n'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'You\nthink. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,\nyou know, diluted presentation.'\n\n'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's a\nsimple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plain\nenough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor\ncan we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of\na wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is\ntravelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than\nwe are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,\nthe impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or\none-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in\ntime. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in\n",
      "which the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing.\n\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the\nTime Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.\n\n'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'but\nwait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.'\n\n'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the Time\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the\nway down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember\nvividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,\nthe dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but\nincredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger\nedition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before\nour eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly\nbeen filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally\ncomplete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the\nbench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better\nlook at it. Quartz it seemed to be.\n\n'Look here,' said the Medical Man,",
      " 'are you perfectly serious?\nOr is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'\n\n'Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp\naloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more\nserious in my life.'\n\nNone of us quite knew how to take it.\n\nI caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he\nwinked at me solemnly.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who\nare too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round\nhim; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in\nambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and\nexplained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have\nshown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his\nmotives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time\nTraveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we\ndistrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less\nclever man seemed tricks in his hands.",
      " It is a mistake to do things\ntoo easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt\nquite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting\ntheir reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a\nnursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very\nmuch about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and\nthe next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of\nour minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,\nthe curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it\nsuggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the\ntrick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,\nwhom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar\nthing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out\nof the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.\n\nThe next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of\nthe Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found\nfour or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical\nMan was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand\n",
      "and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,\nand--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I suppose\nwe'd better have dinner?'\n\n'Where's----?' said I, naming our host.\n\n'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. He\nasks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not\nback. Says he'll explain when he comes.'\n\n'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a\nwell-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.\n\nThe Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself\nwho had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the\nEditor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,\nshy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my\nobservation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was\nsome speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's\nabsence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit.\nThe Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist\nvolunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick'",
      " we\nhad witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition\nwhen the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I\nwas facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'\nAnd the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.\nI gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'\ncried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful\nturned towards the door.\n\nHe was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and\nsmeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it\nseemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour\nhad actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown\ncut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,\nas by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,\nas if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.\nHe walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.\nWe stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak.\n\nHe said not a word,",
      " but came painfully to the table, and made a\nmotion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and\npushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:\nfor he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile\nflickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'\nsaid the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't let\nme disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation.\n'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took\nit off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,\nand a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over\nour faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm\nand comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling\nhis way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll\ncome down and explain things... Save me some of that mutton. I'm\nstarving for a bit of meat.'\n\nHe looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he\n",
      "was all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'\nsaid the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'\n\nHe put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again\nI remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,\nand standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had\nnothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the\ndoor closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered\nhow he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my\nmind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent\nScientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in\nheadlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright\ndinner-table.\n\n'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing the\nAmateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,\nand read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time\nTraveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else had\n",
      "noticed his lameness.\n\nThe first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical\nMan, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants\nwaiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his\nknife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The\ndinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,\nwith gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his\ncuriosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a\ncrossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feel\nassured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up\nthe Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guests\nwere frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_\nthis time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by\nrolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to\nhim, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in\nthe Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and\njoined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole\n",
      "thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,\nirreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Day\nafter To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather\nshouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in\nordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained\nof the change that had startled me.\n\n'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you have\nbeen travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about\nlittle Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'\n\nThe Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a\nword. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' he\nsaid. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'\n\n'Story!' cried the Editor.\n\n'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something to\neat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.\nThanks. And the salt.'\n\n'One word,' said I. 'Have you been time travelling?'\n\n'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full,",
      " nodding his\nhead.\n\n'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor.\nThe Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang\nit with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been\nstaring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine.\nThe rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden\nquestions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same\nwith the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by\ntelling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his\nattention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.\nThe Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller\nthrough his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than\nusual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of\nsheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,\nand looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I was\nsimply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his\nhand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room.\nIt's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the\n",
      "bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room.\n\n'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he\nsaid to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new\nguests.\n\n'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor.\n\n'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but\nI can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what\nhas happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from\ninterruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like\nlying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was in\nmy laboratory at four o'clock, and since then... I've lived eight\ndays... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly\nworn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you.\nThen I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'\n\n'Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' And\nwith that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.\nHe sat back in his chair at first,",
      " and spoke like a weary man.\nAfterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only\ntoo much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my\nown inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,\nattentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,\nsincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the\nintonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed\nthe turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the\ncandles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face\nof the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees\ndownward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each\nother. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the\nTime Traveller's face.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time\nMachine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the\nworkshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of\nthe ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of\n",
      "it's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,\nwhen the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the\nnickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get\nremade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It\nwas at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began\nits career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put\none more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the\nsaddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels\nmuch the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took\nthe starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,\npressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to\nreel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,\nI saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For\na moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted\nthe clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute\nor so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!\n\n'I drew a breath,",
      " set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both\nhands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went\ndark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing\nme, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to\ntraverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room\nlike a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The\nnight came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment\ncame to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter\nand ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night\nagain, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled\nmy ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.\n\n'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time\ntravelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling\nexactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong\nmotion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent\nsmash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a\nblack wing.",
      " The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to\nfall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,\nleaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed\nthe laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.\nI had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too\nfast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that\never crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of\ndarkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the\nintermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her\nquarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling\nstars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the\npalpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;\nthe sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous\ncolor like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak\nof fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating\nband; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a\nbrighter circle flickering in the blue.\n\n'The landscape was misty and vague.",
      " I was still on the hill-side\nupon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me\ngrey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,\nnow brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away.\nI saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams.\nThe whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing\nunder my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my\nspeed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun\nbelt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or\nless, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and\nminute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and\nvanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.\n\n'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They\nmerged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked\nindeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to\naccount. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a\nkind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At\n",
      "first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but\nthese new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions\ngrew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain\ndread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What\nstrange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our\nrudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to\nlook nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated\nbefore my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about\nme, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it\nseemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the\nhill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even\nthrough the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so\nmy mind came round to the business of stopping.\n\n'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some\nsubstance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long\nas I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely\nmattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour\nthrough the interstices of intervening substances!",
      " But to come to\na stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into\nwhatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate\ncontact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical\nreaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow\nmyself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the\nUnknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I\nwas making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an\nunavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the\nrisk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light.\nThe fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,\nthe sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the\nfeeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told\nmyself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I\nresolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over\nthe lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was\nflung headlong through the air.\n\n'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears.",
      " I may have\nbeen stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,\nand I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.\nEverything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the\nconfusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what\nseemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron\nbushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were\ndropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The\nrebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove\nalong the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.\n\"Fine hospitality,\" said I, \"to a man who has travelled innumerable\nyears to see you.\"\n\n'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and\nlooked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white\nstone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy\ndownpour. But all else of the world was invisible.\n\n'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail\ngrew thinner,",
      " I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very\nlarge, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white\nmarble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,\ninstead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so\nthat it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of\nbronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was\ntowards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the\nfaint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,\nand that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood\nlooking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an\nhour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it\ndenser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and\nsaw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was\nlightening with the promise of the sun.\n\n'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full\ntemerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when\nthat hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn?",
      " What might not have\nhappened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?\nWhat if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had\ndeveloped into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly\npowerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more\ndreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to\nbe incontinently slain.\n\n'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate\nparapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping\nin upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic\nfear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to\nreadjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the\nthunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like\nthe trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue\nof the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into\nnothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and\ndistinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out\nin white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses.",
      " I\nfelt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in\nthe clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear\ngrew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again\ngrappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under\nmy desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One\nhand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily\nin attitude to mount again.\n\n'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I\nlooked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote\nfuture. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer\nhouse, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had\nseen me, and their faces were directed towards me.\n\n'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by\nthe White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of\nthese emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon\nwhich I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps\nfour feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a\n",
      "leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish\nwhich--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his\nhead was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm\nthe air was.\n\n'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but\nindescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more\nbeautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used\nto hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.\nI took my hands from the machine.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile\nthing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my\neyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at\nonce. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and\nspoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.\n\n'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps\neight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them\naddressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was\ntoo harsh and deep for them.",
      " So I shook my head, and, pointing to my\nears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then\ntouched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my\nback and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was\nnothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in\nthese pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful\ngentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so\nfrail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them\nabout like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I\nsaw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily\nthen, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto\nforgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the\nlittle levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my\npocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of\ncommunication.\n\n'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some\nfurther peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.\nTheir hair,",
      " which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the\nneck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the\nface, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,\nwith bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a\npoint. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on\nmy part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the\ninterest I might have expected in them.\n\n'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood\nround me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I\nbegan the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.\nThen hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the\nsun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and\nwhite followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the\nsound of thunder.\n\n'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was\nplain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were\nthese creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.\nYou see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight\n",
      "Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in\nknowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a\nquestion that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of\nour five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from\nthe sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended\nupon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features.\nA flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt\nthat I had built the Time Machine in vain.\n\n'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering\nof a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so\nand bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of\nbeautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck.\nThe idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they\nwere all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging\nthem upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who\nhave never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and\nwonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then\nsomeone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the\n",
      "nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,\nwhich had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my\nastonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I\nwent with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a\nprofoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible\nmerriment, to my mind.\n\n'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal\ndimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of\nlittle people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me\nshadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw\nover their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and\nflowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number\nof tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps\nacross the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if\nwild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine\nthem closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the\nturf among the rhododendrons.\n\n'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did\n",
      "not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw\nsuggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and\nit struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.\nSeveral more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we\nentered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking\ngrotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an\neddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,\nin a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.\n\n'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with\nbrown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed\nwith coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered\nlight. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white\nmetal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I\njudged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply\nchannelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length\nwere innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised\nperhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits.\nSome I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,\nbut for the most part they were strange.\n\n'",
      "Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.\nUpon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do\nlikewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the\nfruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into\nthe round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to\nfollow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I\nsurveyed the hall at my leisure.\n\n'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.\nThe stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical\npattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung\nacross the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that\nthe corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,\nthe general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,\nperhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of\nthem, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with\ninterest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating.\nAll were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material.\n\n'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet.",
      " These people of the remote\nfuture were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite\nof some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I\nfound afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the\nIchthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;\none, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was\nthere--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,\nand I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange\nfruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to\nperceive their import.\n\n'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future\nnow. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to\nmake a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of\nmine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a\nconvenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began\na series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some\nconsiderable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts\nmet with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter,",
      " but\npresently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention\nand repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business\nat great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the\nexquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount\nof amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,\nand persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at\nleast at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and\neven the verb \"to eat.\" But it was slow work, and the little people\nsoon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I\ndetermined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in\nlittle doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found\nthey were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more\neasily fatigued.\n\n'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was\ntheir lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of\nastonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop\nexamining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my\nconversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that\n",
      "almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is\nodd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I\nwent out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as\nmy hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men\nof the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and\nlaugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly\nway, leave me again to my own devices.\n\n'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great\nhall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun.\nAt first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely\ndifferent from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big\nbuilding I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river\nvalley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present\nposition. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a\nmile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this\nour planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred\nand One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little\ndials of my machine recorded.\n\n'",
      "As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly\nhelp to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I\nfound the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for\ninstance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of\naluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled\nheaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like\nplants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about\nthe leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict\nremains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not\ndetermine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have\na very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger\ndiscovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.\n\n'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I\nrested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be\nseen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,\nhad vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like\nbuildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such\n",
      "characteristic features of our own English landscape, had\ndisappeared.\n\n'\"Communism,\" said I to myself.\n\n'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the\nhalf-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,\nI perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft\nhairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem\nstrange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything\nwas so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and\nin all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the\nsexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And\nthe children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their\nparents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were\nextremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards\nabundant verification of my opinion.\n\n'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I\nfelt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what\none would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a\nwoman, the institution of the family,",
      " and the differentiation of\noccupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical\nforce; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing\nbecomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where\nviolence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less\nnecessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,\nand the specialization of the sexes with reference to their\nchildren's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even\nin our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I\nmust remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to\nappreciate how far it fell short of the reality.\n\n'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by\na pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in\na transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then\nresumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings\ntowards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently\nmiraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a\nstrange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.\n\n'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,\ncorroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered\n",
      "in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of\ngriffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of\nour old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and\nfair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the\nhorizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal\nbars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in\nwhich the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already\nspoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated\ngreenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose\na white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and\nthere came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There\nwere no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of\nagriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.\n\n'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had\nseen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation\nwas something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a\nhalf-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)\n\n'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.\nThe ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind.",
      " For the\nfirst time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social\neffort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,\nit is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;\nsecurity sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the\nconditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more\nand more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a\nunited humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are\nnow mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and\ncarried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!\n\n'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still\nin the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but\na little department of the field of human disease, but even so,\nit spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our\nagriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and\ncultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the\ngreater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our\nfavourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by\nselective breeding; now a new and better peach,",
      " now a seedless\ngrape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed\nof cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague\nand tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,\ntoo, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will\nbe better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the\ncurrent in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,\neducated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster\ntowards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully\nwe shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit\nour human needs.\n\n'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done\nindeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine\nhad leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or\nfungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;\nbrilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of\npreventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I\nsaw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I\nshall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction\n",
      "and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.\n\n'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in\nsplendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them\nengaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social\nnor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all\nthat commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It\nwas natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of\na social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been\nmet, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase.\n\n'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to\nthe change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is\nthe cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:\nconditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and\nthe weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the\nloyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and\ndecision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that\narise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,\nparental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in\n",
      "the imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent\ndangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against\nconnubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion\nof all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us\nuncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant\nlife.\n\n'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of\nintelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my\nbelief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes\nQuiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had\nused all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which\nit lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.\n\n'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that\nrestless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness.\nEven in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary\nto survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and\nthe love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be\nhindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance\nand security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out\n",
      "of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of\nwar or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting\ndisease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For\nsuch a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as\nthe strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they\nare, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there\nwas no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw\nwas the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy\nof mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the\nconditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which\nbegan the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in\nsecurity; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor\nand decay.\n\n'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died\nin the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to\nsing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and\nno more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented\ninactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and\n",
      "necessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful\ngrindstone broken at last!\n\n'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this\nsimple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered\nthe whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they\nhad devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,\nand their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.\nThat would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my\nexplanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\n'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the\nfull moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver\nlight in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move\nabout below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the\nchill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could\nsleep.\n\n'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to\nthe figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing\ndistinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see\nthe silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron\n",
      "bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn.\nI looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.\n\"No,\" said I stoutly to myself, \"that was not the lawn.\"\n\n'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was\ntowards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came\nhome to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!\n\n'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of\nlosing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world.\nThe bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could\nfeel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another\nmoment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping\nstrides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost\nno time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a\nwarm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying\nto myself: \"They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes\nout of the way.\" Nevertheless, I ran with all my might.",
      " All the\ntime, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,\nI knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the\nmachine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I\nsuppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the\nlittle lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young\nman. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the\nmachine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none\nanswered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit\nworld.\n\n'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace\nof the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the\nempty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it\nfuriously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then\nstopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered\nthe sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in\nthe light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my\ndismay.\n\n'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put\n",
      "the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of\ntheir physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed\nme: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose\nintervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt\nassured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,\nthe machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the\nlevers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from\ntampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,\nand was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?\n\n'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running\nviolently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,\nand startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a\nsmall deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes\nwith my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding\nfrom the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of\nmind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was\ndark, silent, and deserted.",
      " I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell\nover one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a\nmatch and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you.\n\n'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon\nwhich, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I\nhave no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming\nsuddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the\nsplutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.\n\"Where is my Time Machine?\" I began, bawling like an angry child,\nlaying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have\nbeen very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely\nfrightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head\nthat I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do\nunder the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear.\nFor, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear\nmust be forgotten.\n\n'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people\nover in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,\nout under the moonlight.",
      " I heard cries of terror and their little\nfeet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all\nI did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected\nnature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from\nmy own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved\nto and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory\nof horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of\nlooking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit\nruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,\nof lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute\nwretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when\nI woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping\nround me on the turf within reach of my arm.\n\n'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how\nI had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion\nand despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,\nreasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the\n",
      "face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could\nreason with myself. \"Suppose the worst?\" I said. \"Suppose the\nmachine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be\ncalm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear\nidea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials\nand tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another.\" That\nwould be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after\nall, it was a beautiful and curious world.\n\n'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must\nbe calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force\nor cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about\nme, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and\ntravel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal\nfreshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about\nmy business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement\novernight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the\nlittle lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings,",
      " conveyed, as\nwell as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They\nall failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some\nthought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in\nthe world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was\na foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger\nwas ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.\nThe turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about\nmidway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet\nwhere, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine.\nThere were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow\nfootprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed\nmy closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,\nof bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep\nframed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The\npedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them\ndiscontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,\nbut possibly the panels,",
      " if they were doors, as I supposed, opened\nfrom within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very\ngreat mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that\npedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.\n\n'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes\nand under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned\nsmiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,\npointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open\nit. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I\ndon't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were\nto use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is\nhow she would look. They went off as if they had received the last\npossible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,\nwith exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel\nashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and\nI tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper\ngot the better of me. In three strides I was after him,",
      " had him by\nthe loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him\ntowards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his\nface, and all of a sudden I let him go.\n\n'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze\npanels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,\nI thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been\nmistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and\nhammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the\nverdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people\nmust have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on\neither hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the\nslopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down\nto watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too\nOccidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,\nbut to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.\n\n'I got up after a time,",
      " and began walking aimlessly through the\nbushes towards the hill again. \"Patience,\" said I to myself. \"If you\nwant your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they\nmean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their\nbronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as\nyou can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a\npuzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this\nworld. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses\nat its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all.\" Then\nsuddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought\nof the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future\nage, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made\nmyself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a\nman devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help\nmyself. I laughed aloud.\n\n'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little\npeople avoided me. It may have been my fancy,",
      " or it may have had\nsomething to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt\ntolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no\nconcern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course\nof a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what\nprogress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my\nexplorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or\ntheir language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed\nof concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,\nabstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their\nsentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to\nconvey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined\nto put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze\ndoors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,\nuntil my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural\nway. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a\ncircle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.\n\n'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant\n",
      "richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the\nsame abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material\nand style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same\nblossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like\nsilver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and\nso faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which\npresently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain\ncircular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth.\nOne lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my\nfirst walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously\nwrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by\nthe side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,\nI could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection\nwith a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:\na thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I\ndiscovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of\n",
      "air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the\nthroat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at\nonce sucked swiftly out of sight.\n\n'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers\nstanding here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was\noften just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above\na sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong\nsuggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose\ntrue import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to\nassociate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an\nobvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong.\n\n'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and\nbells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my\ntime in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and\ncoming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail\nabout building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while\nsuch details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is\ncontained in one's imagination,",
      " they are altogether inaccessible to\na real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the\ntale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take\nback to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of\nsocial movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels\nDelivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,\nshould be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of\nwhat he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either\napprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro\nand a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between\nmyself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was\nunseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general\nimpression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very\nlittle of the difference to your mind.\n\n'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of\ncrematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me\nthat, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere\nbeyond the range of my explorings.",
      " This, again, was a question I\ndeliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely\ndefeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make\na further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm\namong this people there were none.\n\n'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an\nautomatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.\nYet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The\nseveral big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great\ndining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no\nappliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant\nfabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though\nundecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow\nsuch things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige\nof a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign\nof importations among them. They spent all their time in playing\ngently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful\nfashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things\n",
      "were kept going.\n\n'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,\nhad taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For\nthe life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,\nthose flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall\nI put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and\nthere in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others\nmade up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,\non the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight\nHundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to\nme!\n\n'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I\nwas watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of\nthem was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main\ncurrent ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate\nswimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange\ndeficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the\nslightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which\nwas drowning before their eyes.",
      " When I realized this, I hurriedly\nslipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I\ncaught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of\nthe limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of\nseeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low\nestimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.\nIn that, however, I was wrong.\n\n'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little\nwoman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre\nfrom an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and\npresented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me\nand me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had\nbeen feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my\nappreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little\nstone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The\ncreature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have\ndone. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did\nthe same to hers.",
      " Then I tried talk, and found that her name was\nWeena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed\nappropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship\nwhich lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!\n\n'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She\ntried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about\nit went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,\nexhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems\nof the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come\ninto the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress\nwhen I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting\nwere sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much\ntrouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,\na very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that\nmade her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know\nwhat I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too\nlate did I clearly understand what she was to me.",
      " For, by merely\nseeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she\ncared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return\nto the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of\ncoming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold\nso soon as I came over the hill.\n\n'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the\nworld. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the\noddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made\nthreatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she\ndreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness\nto her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate\nemotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,\namong other things, that these little people gathered into the great\nhouses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a\nlight was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found\none out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark.\nYet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that\n",
      "fear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping away\nfrom these slumbering multitudes.\n\n'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me\ntriumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including\nthe last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm.\nBut my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been\nthe night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had\nbeen restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and\nthat sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.\nI woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal\nhad just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,\nbut I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour\nwhen things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is\ncolourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down\ninto the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the\npalace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the\nsunrise.\n\n'The moon was setting,",
      " and the dying moonlight and the first pallor\nof dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky\nblack, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless.\nAnd up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,\nas I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw\na solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the\nhill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some\ndark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.\nIt seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still\nindistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,\nuncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted\nmy eyes.\n\n'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on\nand its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned\nthe view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were\nmere creatures of the half light. \"They must have been ghosts,\" I\nsaid; \"I wonder whence they dated.\" For a queer notion of Grant\nAllen's came into my head,",
      " and amused me. If each generation die and\nleave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with\nthem. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight\nHundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four\nat once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these\nfigures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my\nhead. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal\nI had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.\nBut Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were\nsoon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.\n\n'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather\nof this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun\nwas hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that\nthe sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,\nunfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,\nforget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into\nthe parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze\nwith renewed energy;",
      " and it may be that some inner planet had\nsuffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the\nsun was very much hotter than we know it.\n\n'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking\nshelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great\nhouse where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:\nClambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,\nwhose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.\nBy contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first\nimpenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from\nlight to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I\nhalted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against\nthe daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness.\n\n'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched\nmy hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was\nafraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which\nhumanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I\nremembered that strange terror of the dark.",
      " Overcoming my fear to\nsome extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my\nvoice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched\nsomething soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something\nwhite ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a\nqueer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar\nmanner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered\nagainst a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was\nhidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.\n\n'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a\ndull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there\nwas flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it\nwent too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it\nran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an\ninstant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could\nnot find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I\n",
      "came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told\nyou, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me.\nCould this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,\nlooking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large\nbright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made\nme shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down\nthe wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot\nand hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the\nlight burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it\ndropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had\ndisappeared.\n\n'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for\nsome time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I\nhad seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that\nMan had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two\ndistinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were\nnot the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,\nobscene, nocturnal Thing,",
      " which had flashed before me, was also heir\nto all the ages.\n\n'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an\nunderground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And\nwhat, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly\nbalanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity\nof the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,\nat the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling\nmyself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there\nI must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I\nwas absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful\nUpper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the\ndaylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging\nflowers at her as he ran.\n\n'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned\npillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form\nto remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried\nto frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more\nvisibly distressed and turned away.",
      " But they were interested by my\nmatches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about\nthe well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to\ngo back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was\nalready in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and\nsliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these\nwells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to\nsay nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the\nfate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion\ntowards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.\n\n'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was\nsubterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which\nmade me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome\nof a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was\nthe bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the\ndark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,\nthose large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are\ncommon features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.\nAnd last of all,",
      " that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty\nyet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar\ncarriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory\nof an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.\n\n'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and\nthese tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of\nventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in\nfact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its\nramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in\nthis artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the\ncomfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible\nthat I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this\nsplitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the\nshape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it\nfell far short of the truth.\n\n'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed\nclear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present\nmerely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and\n",
      "the Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will\nseem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even\nnow there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is\na tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental\npurposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in\nLondon, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are\nsubways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they\nincrease and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had\nincreased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the\nsky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever\nlarger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of\nits time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end\nworker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut\noff from the natural surface of the earth?\n\n'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to\nthe increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf\nbetween them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading\nto the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the\nsurface of the land.",
      " About London, for instance, perhaps half the\nprettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same\nwidening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher\neducational process and the increased facilities for and temptations\ntowards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that\nexchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage\nwhich at present retards the splitting of our species along lines\nof social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,\nabove ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort\nand beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting\ncontinually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they\nwere there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little\nof it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,\nthey would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were\nso constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in\nthe end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as\nwell adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in\ntheir way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs.",
      " As it seemed to\nme, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally\nenough.\n\n'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different\nshape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and\ngeneral co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real\naristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical\nconclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been\nsimply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the\nfellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had\nno convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My\nexplanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the\nmost plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced\ncivilization that was at last attained must have long since passed\nits zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect\nsecurity of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of\ndegeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and\nintelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had\nhappened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect;",
      " but from what\nI had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which\nthese creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification\nof the human type was even far more profound than among the \"Eloi,\"\nthe beautiful race that I already knew.\n\n'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time\nMachine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if\nthe Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And\nwhy were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have\nsaid, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was\ndisappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and\npresently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the\ntopic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little\nharshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my\nown, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased\nabruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in\nbanishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.\nAnd very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands,",
      " while I\nsolemnly burned a match.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\n'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow\nup the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt\na peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the\nhalf-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in\nspirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the\ntouch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic\ninfluence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began\nto appreciate.\n\n'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a\nlittle disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once\nor twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive\nno definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great\nhall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that\nnight Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.\nIt occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the\nmoon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,\nwhen the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these\nwhitened Lemurs,",
      " this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be\nmore abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of\none who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time\nMachine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these\nunderground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I\nhad had a companion it would have been different. But I was so\nhorribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the\nwell appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling,\nbut I never felt quite safe at my back.\n\n'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me\nfurther and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the\nsouth-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe\nWood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century\nBanstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any\nI had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces\nor ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face\nof it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind\nof bluish-green,",
      " of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This\ndifference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded\nto push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come\nupon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I\nresolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I\nreturned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next\nmorning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the\nPalace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable\nme to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I\nwould make the descent without further waste of time, and started\nout in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite\nand aluminium.\n\n'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but\nwhen she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed\nstrangely disconcerted. \"Good-bye, little Weena,\" I said, kissing\nher; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet\nfor the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for\nI feared my courage might leak away!",
      " At first she watched me in\namazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she\nbegan to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition\nnerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little\nroughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I\nsaw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her.\nThen I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.\n\n'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The\ndescent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from\nthe sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of\na creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily\ncramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of\nthe bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into\nthe blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after\nthat experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and\nback were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the\nsheer descent with as quick a motion as possible.",
      " Glancing upward,\nI saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,\nwhile little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. The\nthudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.\nEverything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when\nI looked up again Weena had disappeared.\n\n'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go\nup the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while\nI turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with\nintense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a\nslender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the\naperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and\nrest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I\nwas trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the\nunbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air\nwas full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the\nshaft.\n\n'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching\n",
      "my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,\nhastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar\nto the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating\nbefore the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me\nimpenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and\nsensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they\nreflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see\nme in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear\nof me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in\norder to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark\ngutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the\nstrangest fashion.\n\n'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently\ndifferent from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs\nleft to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before\nexploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, \"You are\nin for it now,\" and,",
      " feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the\nnoise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from\nme, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,\nsaw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into\nutter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it\nwas as much as one could see in the burning of a match.\n\n'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose\nout of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim\nspectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,\nwas very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly\nshed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a\nlittle table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The\nMorlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember\nwondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red\njoint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big\nunmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and\nonly waiting for the darkness to come at me again!",
      " Then the match\nburned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot\nin the blackness.\n\n'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such\nan experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had\nstarted with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would\ncertainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.\nI had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to\nsmoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough\nmatches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that\nglimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure.\nBut, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers\nthat Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and\nfour safety-matches that still remained to me.\n\n'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the\ndark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered\nthat my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me\nuntil that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I\nhad wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders,",
      " to\nwhom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I\nstood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling\nover my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I\nfancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little\nbeings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently\ndisengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The\nsense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably\nunpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of\nthinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I\nshouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then\nI could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more\nboldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,\nand shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so\nseriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came\nback at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined\nto strike another match and escape under the protection of its\nglare.",
      " I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper\nfrom my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I\nhad scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the\nblackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,\nand pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.\n\n'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no\nmistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another\nlight, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine\nhow nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces\nand great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their\nblindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise\nyou: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck\nmy third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening\ninto the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great\npump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting\nhooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind,",
      " and I\nwas violently tugged backward. I lit my last match... and it\nincontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,\nand, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the\nMorlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed\npeering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who\nfollowed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy.\n\n'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or\nthirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest\ndifficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful\nstruggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I\nfelt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the\nwell-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding\nsunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.\nThen I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of\nothers among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\n'Now,",
      " indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,\nexcept during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,\nI had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was\nstaggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought\nmyself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and\nby some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;\nbut there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of\nthe Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I\nloathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen\ninto a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.\nNow I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him\nsoon.\n\n'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the\nnew moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first\nincomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now\nsuch a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights\nmight mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer\ninterval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at\n",
      "least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for\nthe dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that\nthe Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that\nmy second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might\nonce have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their\nmechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding\ndown towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new\nrelationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed\nto a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on\nsufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable\ngenerations, had come at last to find the daylit surface\nintolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and\nmaintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the\nsurvival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse\npaws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:\nbecause ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the\norganism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace.",
      " Ages ago,\nthousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of\nthe ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back\nchanged! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.\nThey were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came\ninto my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.\nIt seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it\nwere by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a\nquestion from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a\nvague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was\nat the time.\n\n'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their\nmysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this\nage of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not\nparalyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend\nmyself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a\nfastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could\nface this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in\n",
      "realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt\nI could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I\nshuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined\nme.\n\n'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but\nfound nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All\nthe buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous\nclimbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the\ntall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished\ngleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,\ntaking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills\ntowards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or\neight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen\nthe place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively\ndiminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and\na nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes\nI wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long\npast sunset when I came in sight of the palace,",
      " silhouetted black\nagainst the pale yellow of the sky.\n\n'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but\nafter a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the\nside of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers\nto stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at\nthe last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase\nfor floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.\nAnd that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'\n\nThe Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and\nsilently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white\nmallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.\n\n'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over\nthe hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to\nreturn to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant\npinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to\nmake her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her\nFear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the\ndusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees.",
      " To me there is always an\nair of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,\nremote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the\nsunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my\nfears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally\nsharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground\nbeneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks\non their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.\nIn my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of\ntheir burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my\nTime Machine?\n\n'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night.\nThe clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another\ncame out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears and\nher fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her\nand caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her\narms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face\nagainst my shoulder.",
      " So we went down a long slope into a valley, and\nthere in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I\nwaded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number\nof sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,\n_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of\nthe Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours\nbefore the old moon rose were still to come.\n\n'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide\nand black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to\nit, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in\nparticular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my\nshoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no\nlonger see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my\ndirection. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of\nwhat it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would\nbe out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking\n",
      "danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose\nupon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the\ntree-boles to strike against.\n\n'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I\ndecided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the\nopen hill.\n\n'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her\nin my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The\nhill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood\nthere came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the\nstars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of\nfriendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations\nhad gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is\nimperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since\nrearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it\nseemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as\nof yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that\n",
      "was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.\nAnd amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet\nshone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.\n\n'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all\nthe gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable\ndistance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of\nthe unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great\nprecessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty\ntimes had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that\nI had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,\nall the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,\nlanguages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as\nI knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these\nfrail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white\nThings of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear\nthat was between the two species, and for the first time, with a\nsudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen\nmight be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping\n",
      "beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and\nforthwith dismissed the thought.\n\n'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as\nI could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find\nsigns of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept\nvery clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at\ntimes. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward\nsky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon\nrose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking\nit, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then\ngrowing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had\nseen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed\nday it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I\nstood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle\nand painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,\nand flung them away.\n\n'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood,",
      " now green and\npleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit\nwherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,\nlaughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such\nthing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the\nmeat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from\nthe bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great\nflood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human\ndecay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on\nrats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating\nand exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His\nprejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so\nthese inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a\nscientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote\nthan our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.\nAnd the intelligence that would have made this state of things a\ntorment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere\n",
      "fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed\nupon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing\nat my side!\n\n'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming\nupon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human\nselfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon\nthe labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword\nand excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to\nhim. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy\nin decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great\ntheir intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the\nhuman form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a\nsharer in their degradation and their Fear.\n\n'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should\npursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to\nmake myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That\nnecessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some\nmeans of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,\nfor nothing,",
      " I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks.\nThen I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of\nbronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had\na persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of\nlight before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I\ncould not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far\naway. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And\nturning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the\nbuilding which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\n'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about\nnoon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass\nremained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had\nfallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high\nupon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I\nwas surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged\nWandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though\nI never followed up the thought--of what might have happened,",
      " or\nmight be happening, to the living things in the sea.\n\n'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed\nporcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some\nunknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might\nhelp me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of\nwriting had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I\nfancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so\nhuman.\n\n'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we\nfound, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many\nside windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.\nThe tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of\nmiscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then\nI perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,\nwhat was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized\nby the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the\nfashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay\nbeside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had\n",
      "dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn\naway. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a\nBrontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the\nside I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away\nthe thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own\ntime. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair\npreservation of some of their contents.\n\n'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South\nKensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,\nand a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the\ninevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and\nhad, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine\nhundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if\nwith extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and\nthere I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare\nfossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the\ncases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as\nI judged. The place was very silent.",
      " The thick dust deadened our\nfootsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping\nglass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very\nquietly took my hand and stood beside me.\n\n'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an\nintellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it\npresented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a\nlittle from my mind.\n\n'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain\nhad a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;\npossibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,\nat least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more\ninteresting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.\nExploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the\nfirst. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a\nblock of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find\nno saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had\ndeliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind,",
      " and set up a\ntrain of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,\nthough on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had\nlittle interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on\ndown a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had\nentered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural\nhistory, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A\nfew shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed\nanimals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a\nbrown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,\nbecause I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by\nwhich the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we\ncame to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly\nill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the\nend at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the\nceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that\noriginally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in\nmy element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of\n",
      "big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some\nstill fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for\nmechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as\nfor the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make\nonly the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if\nI could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of\npowers that might be of use against the Morlocks.\n\n'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she\nstartled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have\nnoticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It\nmay be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum\nwas built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at\nwas quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As\nyou went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,\nuntil at last there was a pit like the \"area\" of a London house\nbefore each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went\nslowly along,",
      " puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent\nupon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until\nWeena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that\nthe gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and\nthen, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant\nand its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it\nappeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My\nsense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.\nI felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of\nmachinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the\nafternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means\nof making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the\ngallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had\nheard down the well.\n\n'I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her\nand turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike\nthose in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this\nlever in my hands,",
      " I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly\nWeena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged\nthe strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a\nminute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than\nsufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I\nlonged very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may\nthink, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was\nimpossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my\ndisinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to\nslake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained\nme from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I\nheard.\n\n'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that\ngallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first\nglance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.\nThe brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I\npresently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had\n",
      "long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left\nthem. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic\nclasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I\nmight, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition.\nBut as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the\nenormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting\npaper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly\nof the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon\nphysical optics.\n\n'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have\nbeen a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little\nhope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had\ncollapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every\nunbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,\nI found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were\nperfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. \"Dance,\"\nI cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed\nagainst the horrible creatures we feared.",
      " And so, in that derelict\nmuseum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge\ndelight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling\n_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a\nmodest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far\nas my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally\ninventive, as you know.\n\n'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped\nthe wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for\nme it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far\nunlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed\njar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed.\nI fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass\naccordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the\nuniversal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,\nperhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a\n",
      "sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil\nBelemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions\nof years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that\nit was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in\nfact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no\nexplosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze\ndoors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had\nchanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.\n\n'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would\nrequire a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all\nthe proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of\narms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a\nsword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised\nbest against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,\nand rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some\nnew metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder\nthere may once have been had rotted into dust.",
      " One corner I saw was\ncharred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the\nspecimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,\nMexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think.\nAnd here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon\nthe nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly\ntook my fancy.\n\n'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery\nafter gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes\nmere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I\nsuddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the\nmerest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite\ncartridges! I shouted \"Eureka!\" and smashed the case with joy. Then\ncame a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,\nI made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in\nwaiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came.\nOf course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from\ntheir presence.",
      " I really believe that had they not been so, I should\nhave rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and\n(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together\ninto non-existence.\n\n'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court\nwithin the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we\nrested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider\nour position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible\nhiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little\nnow. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of\nall defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor\nin my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that\nthe best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,\nprotected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the\nTime Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But\nnow, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards\nthose bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,\nlargely because of the mystery on the other side.",
      " They had never\nimpressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of\niron not altogether inadequate for the work.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\n'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above\nthe horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the\nnext morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods\nthat had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as\nfar as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep\nin the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I\ngathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms\nfull of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had\nanticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from\nsleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the\nwood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,\nfearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending\ncalamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me\nonward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was\nfeverish and irritable.",
      " I felt sleep coming upon me, and the\nMorlocks with it.\n\n'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim\nagainst their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was\nscrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from\ntheir insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather\nless than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare\nhill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer\nresting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could\ncontrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was\nevident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should\nhave to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down.\nAnd then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind\nby lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this\nproceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering\nour retreat.\n\n'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must\nbe in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's\n",
      "heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by\ndewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts.\nLightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to\nwidespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with\nthe heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In\nthis decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on\nthe earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were\nan altogether new and strange thing to Weena.\n\n'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have\ncast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,\nand in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the\nwood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking\nback presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my\nheap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a\ncurved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed\nat that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very\nblack, and Weena clung to me convulsively,",
      " but there was still, as\nmy eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to\navoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of\nremote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of\nmy matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my\nlittle one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.\n\n'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,\nthe faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the\nthrob of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a\npattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more\ndistinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had\nheard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the\nMorlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another\nminute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena\nshivered violently, and became quite still.\n\n'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did\nso, and, as I fumbled with my pocket,",
      " a struggle began in the\ndarkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the\nsame peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,\ntoo, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck.\nThen the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the\nwhite backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took\na lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon\nas the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying\nclutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground.\nWith a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to\nbreathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,\nand as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the\nshadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of\nthe stir and murmur of a great company!\n\n'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder\nand rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In\nmanoeuvring with my matches and Weena,",
      " I had turned myself about\nseveral times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction\nlay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the\nPalace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to\nthink rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp\nwhere we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy\nbole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began\ncollecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness\nround me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.\n\n'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,\ntwo white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.\nOne was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I\nfelt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of\ndismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece\nof camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed\nhow dry was some of the foliage above me,",
      " for since my arrival\non the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,\ninstead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began\nleaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking\nsmoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my\ncamphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I\ntried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could\nnot even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.\n\n'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have\nmade me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in\nthe air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I\nfelt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was\nfull of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just\nto nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had\ntheir hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily\nfelt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone!",
      " Then they\ngripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had\nhappened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness\nof death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of\nburning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,\nand pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to\nfeel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in\na monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt\nlittle teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my\nhand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled\nup, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,\nI thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the\nsucculent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment\nI was free.\n\n'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard\nfighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I\ndetermined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat.",
      " I stood with my\nback to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was\nfull of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices\nseemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements\ngrew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the\nblackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were\nafraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The\ndarkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the\nMorlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,\nwith incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an\nincessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the\nwood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish.\nAs I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap\nof starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I\nunderstood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was\ngrowing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'\nflight.\n\n'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back,",
      " I saw, through\nthe black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning\nforest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for\nWeena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the\nexplosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little\ntime for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the\nMorlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward\nso swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to\nstrike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open\nspace, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and\npast me, and went on straight into the fire!\n\n'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of\nall that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright\nas day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock\nor tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was\nanother arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already\nwrithing from it,",
      " completely encircling the space with a fence of\nfire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled\nby the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against\neach other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their\nblindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of\nfear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more.\nBut when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the\nhawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured\nof their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck\nno more of them.\n\n'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting\nloose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one\ntime the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures\nwould presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the\nfight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the\nfire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about\nthe hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of\nWeena.",
      " But Weena was gone.\n\n'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this\nstrange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and\nmaking uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat\non them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and\nthrough the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they\nbelonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three\nMorlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows\nof my fists, trembling as I did so.\n\n'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.\nI bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat\nthe ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and\nwandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to\nrubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw\nMorlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the\nflames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the\nstreaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening\n",
      "tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,\ncame the white light of the day.\n\n'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was\nplain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I\ncannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the\nawful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was\nalmost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about\nme, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind\nof island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out\nthrough a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that\nI could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the\nremnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and\nmoaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet\nand limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still\npulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time\nMachine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as\nlame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death\n",
      "of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this\nold familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an\nactual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely\nagain--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of\nthis fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing\nthat was pain.\n\n'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning\nsky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose\nmatches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of\nyellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of\nmy arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and\ncould not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here\nwas the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same\nsplendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river\nrunning between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful\npeople moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing\nin exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave\n",
      "me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the\ncupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all\nthe beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their\nday, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the\ncattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And\ntheir end was the same.\n\n'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had\nbeen. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly\ntowards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and\npermanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come\nto this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost\nabsolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and\ncomfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that\nperfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social\nquestion left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.\n\n'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility\nis the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal\nperfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.\nNature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are\n",
      "useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no\nneed of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have\nto meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.\n\n'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his\nfeeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry.\nBut that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical\nperfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the\nfeeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become\ndisjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a\nfew thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The\nUnder-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,\nstill needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained\nperforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human\ncharacter, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they\nturned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it\nin my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven\nHundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit\ncould invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me,",
      " and as that I\ngive it to you.\n\n'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and\nin spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm\nsunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon\nmy theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my\nown hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and\nrefreshing sleep.\n\n'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being\ncaught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on\ndown the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one\nhand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket.\n\n'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal\nof the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid\ndown into grooves.\n\n'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter.\n\n'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner\nof this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.\nSo here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the\n",
      "White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost\nsorry not to use it.\n\n'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.\nFor once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks.\nSuppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the\nbronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it\nhad been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that\nthe Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in\ntheir dim way to grasp its purpose.\n\n'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere\ntouch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The\nbronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.\nI was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I\nchuckled gleefully.\n\n'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards\nme. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on\nthe levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one\nlittle thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light\nonly on the box.\n\n'",
      "You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were\nclose upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at\nthem with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the\nmachine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had\nsimply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and\nat the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,\nindeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,\nI had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's\nskull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in\nthe forest, I think, this last scramble.\n\n'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging\nhands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.\nI found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already\ndescribed.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\n'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes\nwith time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the\nsaddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite\ntime I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated,",
      " quite\nunheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials\nagain I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records\ndays, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and\nanother thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,\nI had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I\ncame to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was\nsweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into\nfuturity.\n\n'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of\nthings. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was\nstill travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession\nof day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,\nreturned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much\nat first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,\nand so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed\nto stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over\nthe earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared\nacross the darkling sky.",
      " The band of light that had indicated the\nsun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it\nsimply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more\nred. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,\ngrowing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of\nlight. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very\nlarge, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with\na dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At\none time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,\nbut it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this\nslowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal\ndrag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,\neven as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,\nfor I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse\nmy motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the\nthousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a\nmere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a\n",
      "desolate beach grew visible.\n\n'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round.\nThe sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,\nand out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale\nwhite stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and\nsouth-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by\nthe horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The\nrocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of\nlife that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation\nthat covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It\nwas the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the\nlichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual\ntwilight.\n\n'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away\nto the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the\nwan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of\nwind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a\ngentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving\nand living.",
      " And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was\na thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a\nsense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing\nvery fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of\nmountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied\nthan it is now.\n\n'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a\nthing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into\nthe sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The\nsound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself\nmore firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,\nquite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving\nslowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous\ncrab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,\nwith its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws\nswaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling,\nand its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic\n",
      "front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,\nand a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see\nthe many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it\nmoved.\n\n'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt\na tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to\nbrush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost\nimmediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught\nsomething threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a\nfrightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna\nof another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes\nwere wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with\nappetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,\nwere descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and\nI had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was\nstill on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I\nstopped.",
      " Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the\nsombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green.\n\n'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over\nthe world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt\nDead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring\nmonsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous\nplants, the thin air that hurts one's lungs: all contributed to an\nappalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same\nred sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the\nsame chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in\nand out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward\nsky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon.\n\n'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a\nthousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth's fate,\nwatching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller\nin the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At\nlast,",
      " more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of\nthe sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling\nheavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of\ncrabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green\nliverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with\nwhite. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again\ncame eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay\nunder the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating\ncrest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the\nsea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse\nof that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still\nunfrozen.\n\n'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A\ncertain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the\nmachine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green\nslime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A\nshallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded\n",
      "from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about\nupon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I\njudged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was\nmerely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed\nto me to twinkle very little.\n\n'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun\nhad changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I\nsaw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this\nblackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that\nan eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was\npassing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be\nthe moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I\nreally saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to\nthe earth.\n\n'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening\ngusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air\nincreased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and\nwhisper.",
      " Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?\nIt would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of\nman, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,\nthe stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.\nAs the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,\ndancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At\nlast, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of\nthe distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a\nmoaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping\ntowards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All\nelse was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.\n\n'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote\nto my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I\nshivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow\nin the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to\nrecover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return\njourney. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing\n",
      "upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving\nthing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the\nsize of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles\ntrailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering\nblood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I\nwas fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote\nand awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\n'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon\nthe machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was\nresumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with\ngreater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and\nflowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again\nthe dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity.\nThese, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the\nmillion dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize\nour own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back\nto the starting-point,",
      " the night and day flapped slower and slower.\nThen the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,\nnow, I slowed the mechanism down.\n\n'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told\nyou that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs.\nWatchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,\nlike a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when\nshe traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to\nbe the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower\nend opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,\nand disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.\nJust before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed\nlike a flash.\n\n'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar\nlaboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got\noff the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several\nminutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was\nmy old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept\n",
      "there, and the whole thing have been a dream.\n\n'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east\ncorner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the\nnorth-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the\nexact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White\nSphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine.\n\n'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came\nthrough the passage here, limping, because my heel was still\npainful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_\non the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and\nlooking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. I\nheard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so\nsick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the\ndoor on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am\ntelling you the story.\n\n'I know,' he said, after a pause, 'that all this will be absolutely\nincredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here\n",
      "to-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces\nand telling you these strange adventures.'\n\nHe looked at the Medical Man. 'No. I cannot expect you to believe\nit. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the\nworkshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our\nrace until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its\ntruth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking\nit as a story, what do you think of it?'\n\nHe took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap\nwith it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary\nstillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the\ncarpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and looked\nround at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of\ncolour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the\ncontemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end\nof his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The\nothers, as far as I remember, were motionless.\n\nThe Editor stood up with a sigh.",
      " 'What a pity it is you're not\na writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the Time\nTraveller's shoulder.\n\n'You don't believe it?'\n\n'Well----'\n\n'I thought not.'\n\nThe Time Traveller turned to us. 'Where are the matches?' he said.\nHe lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. 'To tell you the truth\n... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...'\n\nHis eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers\nupon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his\npipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his\nknuckles.\n\nThe Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers.\n'The gynaeceum's odd,' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to\nsee, holding out his hand for a specimen.\n\n'I'm hanged if it isn't a quarter to one,' said the Journalist.\n'How shall we get home?'\n\n'Plenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychologist.\n\n'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don't\nknow the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?'\n\nThe Time Traveller hesitated.",
      " Then suddenly: 'Certainly not.'\n\n'Where did you really get them?' said the Medical Man.\n\nThe Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who\nwas trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were put\ninto my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He stared\nround the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and you\nand the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I\never make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all\nonly a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at\ntimes--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. And\nwhere did the dream come from?... I must look at that machine. If\nthere is one!'\n\nHe caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through\nthe door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering\nlight of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and\naskew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering\nquartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail\n",
      "of it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of\ngrass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry.\n\nThe Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand\nalong the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I\ntold you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in the\ncold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we\nreturned to the smoking-room.\n\nHe came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his\ncoat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain\nhesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he\nlaughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling\ngood night.\n\nI shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'\nFor my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was\nso fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I\nlay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go\nnext day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the\n",
      "laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him.\nThe laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the\nTime Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the\nsquat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the\nwind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer\nreminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to\nmeddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me\nin the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small\ncamera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when\nhe saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'\nsaid he, 'with that thing in there.'\n\n'But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel through\ntime?'\n\n'Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He\nhesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half an\nhour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you.\nThere's some magazines here.",
      " If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove you\nthis time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'll\nforgive my leaving you now?'\n\nI consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,\nand he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of\nthe laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily\npaper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly\nI was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet\nRichardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw\nthat I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the\npassage to tell the Time Traveller.\n\nAs I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,\noddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air\nwhirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the\nsound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was\nnot there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in\na whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so\ntransparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was\n",
      "absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.\nThe Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the\nfurther end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,\napparently, just been blown in.\n\nI felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had\nhappened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange\nthing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,\nand the man-servant appeared.\n\nWe looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----\ngone out that way?' said I.\n\n'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him\nhere.'\n\nAt that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I\nstayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,\nperhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he\nwould bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must\nwait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,\nas everybody knows now, he has never returned.\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nOne cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return?",
      " It may be that he\nswept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy\nsavages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the\nCretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian\nbrutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the\nphrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral\nreef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did\nhe go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still\nmen, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome\nproblems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own\npart, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,\nfragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminating\ntime! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been\ndiscussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought\nbut cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the\ngrowing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must\n",
      "inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that\nis so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me\nthe future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a\nfew casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for\nmy comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and\nflat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had\ngone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart\nof man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Time Machine, by H.
