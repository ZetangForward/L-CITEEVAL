      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nLeonard: I don\u2019t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.\nSheldon: Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want to play a game, Sheldon.\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?\nLeonard: An old boyfriend who\u2019s definitely not gay. That\u2019s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.\n\nSheldon: All right, I\u2019ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.\nLeonard: And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!\nSheldon: Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nLeonard: What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I\u2019m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re cool or not because I\u2019m Penny and I\u2019m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you\u2019re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I\u2019m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!\nSheldon: Leonard! Stop the car!\nLeonard: What?\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t listen to the two of you fight anymore.\nSheldon: Come on, come on, we\u2019re late.\nLeonard: Calm down, we\u2019ll make the movie.\nSheldon: I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we\u2019ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.\nRaj: Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.\nSheldon: Go, go, Power Rangers, go!\nPenny: Hey.\n\nLeonard: Hey. We\u2019re, uh, going to the movies.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: No, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.\nLeonard: Hang on. They\u2019re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn\u2019t want to come, would you?\nPenny: Not really, no.\nSheldon: All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone\u2019s civil, nobody\u2019s fighting. Have a nice evening.\nLeonard: Just give us a minute.\nHoward: Oh, take all the time you need.\n\nLeonard: So, are we going to talk about last night?\nPenny: Are you ready to apologize?\nLeonard: No.\nPenny: E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.\nLeonard: Oh, come on. This is stupid.\nPenny: Oh, there it is again! You think I\u2019m stupid!\nLeonard: No, there\u2019s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.\nPenny: Oh, yeah? well, there\u2019s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!\nLeonard: No, there isn\u2019t! They\u2019re synonyms!\n\nRaj: Well, that was rather unpleasant.\nHoward: Yeah, I don\u2019t think I need my preshow urination anymore.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we\u2019re going to be late for the movies.\nHoward: Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.\nSheldon: Got it.\nHoward: Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It\u2019ll help take your mind off things.\n\nStuart: Hey, guys. What\u2019s going on?\nLeonard: Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.\nStuart: Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.\nLeonard: Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it\u2019s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?\nHoward: No, I mean, she\u2019s obviously way out of line.\nLeonard: Thank you!\n\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nHoward: But if she dumps you, she\u2019ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you\u2019ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?\nLeonard: I am not going to fold.\nRaj: Well, excuse me, I don\u2019t think Penny\u2019s out of line at all. You don\u2019t own her. It\u2019s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.\u201d\n\nHoward: Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should\u2019ve backed off.\nRaj: You mean like when a guy\u2019s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn\u2019t show up because he\u2019s doing a juice fast with his mother?\nHoward: I didn\u2019t know you were upset about that.\nRaj: Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.\nHoward: Okay, sorry.\n\nRaj: Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you\u2019re upset with a guy named Howard!\nHoward: I said I\u2019m sorry.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nRaj: Sorry doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!\nHoward: Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say \u201cHave you ever peed so much in your life?\u201d\nRaj: Oh, my God, you are such a mama\u2019s boy.\n\nHoward: Hey, don\u2019t bring my mother into this!\nRaj: You brought your mother into this!\nSheldon: Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn\u2019t quit drinkin\u2019 I\u2019d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, \u2019cause I\u2019m drunk as hell and you\u2019re still here! Stop yelling! You\u2019re making Sheldon cry! I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.\nHoward: Boy, what got him so upset?\n\nPenny: Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: This is a restaurant. It\u2019s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you\u2019d be familiar with the paradigm.\nPenny: Is Leonard coming?\nSheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s not gonna happen.\nSheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.\nPenny: Which is?\n\nSheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.\nPenny: I\u2019m busy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, miss. I\u2019d like to order lunch.\nPenny: Fine. What do you want?\nSheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else\u2019s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?\n\nPenny: No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: You can\u2019t make a half-sandwich. If it\u2019s not half of a whole sandwich, it\u2019s just a small sandwich.\nPenny: Okay, fine, it\u2019s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?\nSheldon: Of course not. I\u2019ll have my usual.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?\nPenny: Don\u2019t you usually get lemonade?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Do you want lemonade?\n\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Anything else?\nSheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.\nPenny: I am not going to apologize. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.\nSheldon: Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.\nPenny: Well, I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn\u2019t about you.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t follow.\nPenny: Yeah, yeah, I\u2019ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.\n\nSheldon: All right, let\u2019s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.\nPenny: Leonard is wrong.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: Considering the number of transgressions you\u2019ve committed that he\u2019s overlooked, don\u2019t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?\nPenny: I\u2019m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I\u2019ve committed?\nSheldon: Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?\n\nPenny: Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you\u2019re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?\nSheldon: Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.\nPenny: My singing?\nSheldon: That\u2019s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn\u2019t agree with it.\nPenny: Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn\u2019t he just said so?\n\nSheldon: Because, according to him, you\u2019re oversensitive and have a temper.\nPenny: Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!\nSheldon: And she wonders why she\u2019s constantly undertipped.\nLeonard: Hey.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: Oh, good, you\u2019re home. I need you to do me a favour.\nLeonard: Sure.\nSheldon: Go apologize to Penny.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Right now would be good.\n(knocking): Leonard!\nSheldon: Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.\n\nPenny: I hear you don\u2019t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.\nLeonard: What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?\nPenny: It doesn\u2019t matter why he told me. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, it\u2019s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can\u2019t live with is you casually informing me that some guy\u2019s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!\nPenny: That isn\u2019t even your problem, the problem is you don\u2019t trust me!\n\nLeonard: Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don\u2019t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?\nPenny: Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nLeonard: Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!\nPenny: No, I\u2019m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!\nLeonard: Why didn\u2019t you say so?\nPenny: Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!\n\nLeonard: Well, I can\u2019t read your mind, Penny!\nPenny: Really? Why not? You\u2019re so smart, and I\u2019m so dumb!\nSheldon:  Raj.  Raj.  Raj.\nRaj: Stop knocking! It\u2019s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can\u2019t come home for my cousin Sanjay\u2019s wedding.\n\nKoothrappali: Sheldon, ask our son what we\u2019re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.\nKoothrappali: You should be thanking us!\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nKoothrappali: Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.\n\nRaj: I don\u2019t care! And why don\u2019t you think I can find a woman for myself?\nKoothrappali: Because you\u2019re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.\nRaj: Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I\u2019ll come home for Sanjay\u2019s wedding.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?\n\nStuart: Yeah, he\u2019s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.\nLeonard: Thank you.\nStuart: Uh, Penny?\nPenny: Yeah?\nStuart: Is everything okay?\nPenny: What do you mean?\nStuart: Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?\nPenny: Oh, yeah, kind of. It\u2019s, it\u2019s no big thing.\nStuart: Oh, good, good.  I love you.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nLeonard: I\u2019m not leaving until you talk to me.\nPenny: All right, what\u2019s going on?\n\nLeonard: It\u2019s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he\u2019s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we\u2019re in, but he can\u2019t perceive us.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I\u2019m just ignoring you.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, let\u2019s go home. Look, we\u2019re done fighting.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I\u2019m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad\u2019s meatloaf, and my dad\u2019s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.\nPenny: Okay, there\u2019s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.\nSheldon: Really? Where\u2019s your friend Justin going to sleep?\nLeonard: Yeah, where\u2019s he gonna sleep?\n\nPenny: Oh, my God, would you let this go?!\nStuart: I\u2019d let it go.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nLeonard: Why should I let it go? Why don\u2019t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep?  Oh, for God\u2019s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them.\nPenny: Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let\u2019s just\u2026 Sheldon, please,\nLeonard: Always is a long time. Sure. Always.\n\nSheldon: Sheldon\u2019s log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\u2019m going to be dining alone this evening, so I\u2019ll be reducing my usual order. I\u2019d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.\noff): Sheldon help!\n\nSheldon: I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..\nPenny: Come in! Hurry!\nSheldon: Penny?\nPenny: I\u2019m back here.\nSheldon:  Penny.  Penny.  Penny..\nPenny: Oh, for god\u2019s sakes, I\u2019m in the bathroom!\nSheldon: Shall I come back at a better time?\nPenny: Get in here! Hurry! Don\u2019t you dare knock.\nSheldon: Hello.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nPenny: I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.\nSheldon: Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Tubs are slippery.\nPenny: I know. I slipped.\nSheldon: I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?\nSheldon: They\u2019re holding umbrellas.\nPenny: What?\n\nSheldon: The ducks in my tub.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: They\u2019re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.\nPenny: Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.\nSheldon: Well, assuming you\u2019re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.\nPenny: Okay, can you drive me?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drive.\nPenny: Well, I can\u2019t drive!\nSheldon: Well, it seems we\u2019ve reached an impasse.\n\nPenny: Ow.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.\nPenny: No, no, no, I can\u2019t wait that long, you got to help me, please.\nSheldon: All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.\nPenny: No one\u2019s saying that. Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.\n\nSheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?\nPenny: I don\u2019t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.\nSheldon: My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.\nPenny: One was already in an accident.\nSheldon: That doesn\u2019t mean one won\u2019t be in another, especially if I\u2019m driving.\nPenny: Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!\nSheldon: Okay, here.\nPenny: Seriously? Those shorts with that top?\nSheldon: All right.\n\nPenny: No\u2026 No\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s cute.\nSheldon: We should have you checked for a concussion.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nPenny: Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.\nSheldon: All right.\nPenny: But don\u2019t look.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t look?\nPenny: I don\u2019t want you to see me naked.\nSheldon: Oh. Well, that\u2019s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.\n\nPenny: Yeah, great.\nSheldon: They always look. It never ends well.\nPenny: Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.\nSheldon: Ok.\nPenny: Is that my arm?\nSheldon: It doesn\u2019t feel like an arm.\nPenny: Then, maybe you should let it go.\nSheldon: All righty.\nSheldon: For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.\nPenny: You have your learner\u2019s permit, right?\n\nSheldon: Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.\nPenny: Good.\nSheldon: Didn\u2019t work out well.\nPenny: All right, can we please go?\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: One moment. According to my driver\u2019s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver\u2019s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There\u2019s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?\nPenny: It\u2019s right there.\n\nSheldon: Where is the passenger side mirror?\nPenny: In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?\nSheldon: Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I\u2019m going to have to start again.\nPenny: Could you please drive a little faster?\nSheldon: Oh, I think we\u2019re going sufficiently fast. What\u2019s that?\nPenny: Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.\nSheldon: That can\u2019t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.\n\nPenny: No. The light has been on since I bought the car.\nSheldon: All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.\nPenny: It\u2019s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise\u2019s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.\nPenny: Oh, god, I\u2019m gonna lose the arm.\n\nSheldon: Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?\nPenny: It\u2019s not soup, it\u2019s courage.\nSheldon: No, it isn\u2019t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.\nPenny: How did you see it? You said you wouldn\u2019t look.\nSheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.\n\nSheldon: All right, there\u2019s no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you\u2019ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nPenny: I dislocated my shoulder.\nSheldon: All right. And how did the accident occur?\nPenny: You ready know that.\nSheldon: Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?\n\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Kidney disease?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Migraines?\nPenny: Getting one.\nSheldon: Are you currently pregnant?\nPenny: No.\nSheldon: Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.\nPenny: Change migraine to yes.\nSheldon: When was your last menstrual period?\nPenny: Oh, next question.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.\n\nPenny: Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?\nSheldon: Episodes of sub psychotic rage.\nPenny: Ass.\nSheldon: Possible Tourette\u2019s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nPenny: Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don\u2019t know, comforting?\n\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry. There, there. Everything\u2019s going to be fine. Sheldon\u2019s here.\nPenny: Thanks. That\u2019s much better.\nSheldon: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don\u2019t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.\nPenny: Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I\u2019d say that.\nSheldon: Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.\n\nPenny: You know, people think you\u2019re this weird robot man who\u2019s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it\u2019s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You\u2019re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.\nSheldon: That\u2019s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.\nPenny: Sing \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d to me.\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nSheldon: \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d is for when you\u2019re sick. You\u2019re not sick.\nPenny: Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.\n\nHoward: Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?\nRaj: Actually, I\u2019ve never had three dates with the same woman.\nLeonard: With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.\nHoward: Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?\nLeonard: No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.\n\n(arriving): I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?\nLeonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.\nSheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?\nLeonard: Never mind, what\u2019s your announcement?\nSheldon: Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know\u2026\n\n",
      "DATE: November 16, 2009\nKripke: Hey, Cooper, I hear you\u2019re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.\nSheldon: Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.\nKripke: My pweasure.\nSheldon: My thank you was not sincere.\n\nKripke: But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don\u2019t answer, it\u2019s wetowical.\nSheldon: Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I\u2019m sorry you had to hear that.\nLeonard: Are you really going to be on NPR?\n\nSheldon: Yes, they\u2019re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices.

I need to make sure that they\u2019re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you.\nHoward: Excuse me, I have a master\u2019s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.\nSheldon: Yes. Look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you.\nLeonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don\u2019t have to do it.\n\nRaj: In fact, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.\nPenny: Hi, guys.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: Hello.\nPenny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. I\u2019m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven\u2019t you called Bernadette?\nHoward: Did she say something?\nPenny: Yeah, she said she hasn\u2019t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?\nHoward: I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s my type.\n\n",

I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.\nPenny: Different how?\nHoward: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.\nPenny: Are you high?\nLeonard: You\u2019d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.\n\nHoward: Okay, now you\u2019re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.\nPenny: Howard, you\u2019re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you\u2019re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?\nHoward: Hey, just because you settled doesn\u2019t mean I have to.\nLeonard: Excuse me, I\u2019m sitting here.\nPenny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.\nPoliceman: Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.\nLeonard: What are we supposed to do now?\n\nSheldon: The only thing we can do.

It\u2019s one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.\nPenny: Sheldon, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I\u2019m going to miss you.\nSheldon: Please, Penny, as you know, I\u2019m not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.\n\n",

The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.\nPenny: Sheldon, that\u2019s so\u2026\n\nPenny: Whatcha doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.\nPenny: Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You\u2019ve been up all night?\nSheldon: Is it morning?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Then I\u2019ve been up all night.\nPenny: And you\u2019re stuck?\nSheldon: Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?\nPenny: Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can\u2019t help you till I\u2019ve had my coffee.\n\n",

If you\u2019re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.\nLeonard: Aye, aye, Captain.\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t see it! It just won\u2019t coalesce.\nLeonard: Maybe you need a fresh start.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right.  It\u2019s a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.\nSheldon: Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass\u2026\nHoward: How long has he been stuck?\nLeonard: Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.\nSheldon: Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.\nHoward: Have you tried rebooting him?\n\nLeonard: No, I think it\u2019s a firmware problem.\n",

Bernadette\u2019s been hocking me to take her roller skating.\nLeonard: I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.\nHoward: What could be better? We\u2019re in.\nRaj: Great. It\u2019s not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.\nHoward: You can come with us.\n\nRaj: No, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to go. I\u2019m happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I\u2019m a walking brown Yelp.com.\nSheldon: Structure, constant structure. One atom\u2026\nHoward: Boy, he\u2019s really gone, isn\u2019t he?\nLeonard: Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.\nHoward: I thought I smelled popcorn.\nSheldon: Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it\u2019s always hexagonal\u2026\n\nLeonard: I haven\u2019t seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.\nplate): Hey, those are my lima beans!\n",

Perfect, they can be electrons.\nHoward: Want my corn?\nSheldon: Don\u2019t be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?\nLeonard: So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?\n\nHoward: Good. P.F. Chang\u2019s? My mom has coupons.\nLeonard: Great. Your mom\u2019s not coming, right?\nHoward: Not this time, I promise.\nRaj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I\u2019m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.\nSheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.\nRaj: Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.\nBernadette: Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?\n\nPenny: Not recently.\nBernadette: I don\u2019t know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.\n",

I\u2019m moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.\nPenny: Oh, poor baby.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t tell Koothrappali. After you.\nPenny: Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon.\nLeonard: Oh, my God! Are you\u2026\nSheldon: Good Lord! You\u2019re ruining everything!\nPenny: Oh, damn.\nLeonard: Are you okay?\nPenny: Do I look okay?\nLeonard: Don\u2019t bark at me.

Not important. I don\u2019t need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.\nPenny: Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s a crazy thing.\nBernadette: Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don\u2019t get enough REM sleep?\nSheldon: They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.\nBernadette: Which leads to\u2026?\nSheldon: Impaired cognitive function.\n\nBernadette: Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.\nSheldon: But I don\u2019t want to go to bed.\nBernadette: I\u2019m going to count to three.

Where is he?\nGuard: Ball pit.\nLeonard: Thanks for not calling the cops.\n\nGuard: Oh, hey, it\u2019s no big deal. My sister\u2019s got a kid who\u2019s special.\nLeonard: Yeah, well, he\u2019s extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?\nSheldon: Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn\u2019t visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.\nLeonard: Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?\nSheldon: Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child\u2019s play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.\n\nLeonard: No, I don\u2019t think so. We need to go home now.\nSheldon: But I\u2019m still working.\nLeonard: If you don\u2019t come out of there, I\u2019m going to have to drag you out.\nSheldon: You can try, but you\u2019ll never catch me.\n",

What, what, what?\n\nSheldon:  Leonard and Penny.\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: I have good news.\nLeonard: And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?\nSheldon: Your cell phone was off.\nLeonard: Because we didn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\nSheldon: And that didn\u2019t work out, did it?\nPenny: Sheldon, what do you want?\nSheldon: I came to tell you I\u2019ve got the answer.\nLeonard: Really? You figured out the graphene problem?\n\nSheldon: No, no, I\u2019m still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.\nPenny: Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong.

That\u2019s in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I\u2019m going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.\nLeonard: Sounds like a great plan.\nSheldon: Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.\n\nAssistant: So, Mr. Cooper, you\u2019re looking for a job.\nSheldon: A menial job. Like yours.\nAssistant: Why, thank you for noticing. I\u2019m Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?\n",
      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?\nAssistant: No.\nSheldon: Shouldn\u2019t you check your database?\n\ntimes): No.\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t really type.\nAssistant: I didn\u2019t really have to. So, how about construction?\nSheldon: Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.\nAssistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.\nSheldon: I could do that.\nAssistant: Good.\nSheldon: One question.\nAssistant: Yes?\nSheldon: What\u2019s sheetrock?\n\nAssistant: Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?\nSheldon: That seems acceptable.\nAssistant: Do you have your own car?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drive.\n",

What was your last job?\nSheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman\u2019s terms, string theory.\nAssistant: I see. Just give me a second. Security!\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019ll get those drinks started for you.\ntray): Behind you.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?\nSheldon: I\u2019m trying to get these tables cleared. We\u2019re slammed.\nPenny: No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?\nSheldon: A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don\u2019t like touching other people\u2019s coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.\n\nPenny: You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?\n",
      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Oh, heavens, no. Since I don\u2019t need to be paid, I didn\u2019t need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.\nPenny: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.\nSheldon: Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.\n\nBernadette: Thanks, Sheldon.\nPenny: Sheldon, wait, this isn\u2019t even what I do. I\u2019m a waitress, not a busboy.\nSheldon: You\u2019re right.

That was fun.\nRaj: How long can he keep this up?\nLeonard: I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.\nRaj: He never went back to the university?\nLeonard: Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg\u2019s shih tzu.\n\n",

There\u2019s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it\u2019s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.\nHoward: That\u2019s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.\nRaj: Thank you.\nHoward: Although, I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t a little bit of a perk.\nLeonard: Who\u2019s miserable and alone?\n\nRaj: Me.\nLeonard: Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.\nSheldon: In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.\nLeonard: Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine\u2019s Day?\nHoward: Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops.

Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.\n\nLeonard: Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken.

Isn\u2019t anyone going to ask?\nRaj: Fine, tell us you\u2019re going to have sex with Penny.\nLeonard: That\u2019s not what I was going to tell you.\nRaj: It\u2019s okay.

At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don\u2019t care.

Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here\u2019s Frodo.\nLeonard: You made Frodo pancakes?\nSheldon: Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.\nLeonard: Why are you doing this?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I\u2019ve had some time to reflect and I\u2019ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It\u2019s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other.

AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?\n\nSheldon: Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let\u2019s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.\nPenny: Okay, show\u2019s over.\nSheldon: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve got five more slides.\n\n",

Bye-bye.\nRaj: You know what? Even though I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine\u2019s Day.\nHoward: Trust me, you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried.\n\nRaj: No, no, no, I\u2019m going to have a me day. First I\u2019m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage.

It\u2019s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I\u2019m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.\n\nLeonard: You\u2019re not going to Switzerland!\nSheldon: Oh, but I am. Didn\u2019t Penny tell you the good news?\nLeonard: She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.\nSheldon: Yes, that good news.\nLeonard: Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it\u2019s Penny, not you!\nSheldon: Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s a somewhat ambiguous response.

I\u2019m sick.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I\u2019m sick, too.\n\nLeonard: Will you please turn your shirt off?\nRaj: What? I\u2019m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I\u2019m awesome and to be feared.\nHoward: Yeah, right, there\u2019s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who\u2019s got music blasting from between his nipples.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, what\u2019s going on?\nStuart: Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.\n",

My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan\u2019s doing him a favour.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?\nLeonard: Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.\nSheldon: Well, look who thinks he\u2019s Stuart\u2019s uncle now.\nRaj: Can\u2019t believe it. We\u2019re going to meet Stan Lee!\n\nHoward: I\u2019m sad to say I taught him those moves.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom.  Alex, I\u2019m going to go with what is\u2026 you\u2019re a dumbass?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month\u2019s Batman.\nHoward: That\u2019s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.\n\n",
      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.\nRaj: That\u2019s a great idea, I\u2019m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.\nSheldon: What is it about the word unique you don\u2019t understand?\nHoward: Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.\nRaj: Well, obviously you don\u2019t remember your circumcision.\n\nSheldon: There\u2019s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?\nLeonard: He does.

So, is this Bruce Lee\u2019s nerdy brother, Stan?\nHoward: Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?\nSheldon: Because most of the things I\u2019m planning to buy haven\u2019t been invented yet.\nHoward: But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don\u2019t you put it in the bank?\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t trust banks.

      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it\u2019s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?\nSheldon: It bothers me.\nHoward: Sheldon, this is a summons.\nSheldon: A summons for what?\n\nHoward: Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.\nSheldon: November 16?

Also, that\u2019s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.\n\nPenny: Mmm, no, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?\n",

I told them I wasn\u2019t driving and they were all, if it wasn\u2019t you, who was it?\nSheldon: So you betrayed me?\nPenny: No! It wasn\u2019t a betrayal. It was more of a can\u2019t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSheldon: But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.\nPenny: Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I\u2019m guilty.\nHoward: You are guilty.  That one I liked.\n\nSheldon: I am not guilty. I only have a learner\u2019s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.\n",

On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I\u2019m going to begin preparing my defence right now.\n\nHoward: Okay, he\u2019s going to jail.\nhim): Oh, that\u2019s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.\nSheldon: Now you see what you\u2019ve done? Because of you, we\u2019re all going to miss Stan Lee.\nLeonard: Whoa! What do you mean all?\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re my friends. You\u2019ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I\u2019m victorious.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay. No.\n\nSheldon: Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?\nLeonard: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nSheldon: Howard?\n",

Penny.\ndoor):  Penny.\nSheldon: That\u2019s just wrong.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I\u2019d like to call on your skills as an actress.\nPenny: What is this?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?\nPenny: Do I have a choice?\n\nSheldon: Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?\n",

Go on.\n\nPenny: The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I\u2019ve ever seen in, like, ever.\nSheldon: And who performed that heroic act?\nPenny: Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.\nSheldon: There\u2019s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.\n\nPenny: But it is a fact that it\u2019s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?\nSheldon: Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.\ntears): But it is a fact that it\u2019s a privilege to know you. Totally.\nSheldon: Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.\nJudge: Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?\nSheldon: Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.

Anyway, if it would please the court, I\u2019d like to begin with an opening statement.\nJudge: The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.\n\nSheldon: Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I\u2019m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.\n\nJudge: Impressive.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nJudge: Guilty. Pay the cashier.\nSheldon: I object. You\u2019re completely ignoring the law.\n",

I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.\nJudge: Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I\u2019m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.\nSheldon: I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s my spot.\nSheldon: Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?\nGuard: What?\nSheldon: I need to use the restroom.\nGuard: Knock yourself out.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the toilet?\nGuard: Well, it ain\u2019t a wishing well.\nSheldon: Please tell the judge I\u2019m ready to apologize.\nLeonard: Look at that.

How\u2019d it go?\nSheldon: You know very well how it went.\nLeonard: Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.\nSheldon: I was found guilty and fined $533.\n\nPenny: I\u2019m going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.\nSheldon: I also now have three points on a driver\u2019s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.\nHoward: Plus, you didn\u2019t get to meet Stan Lee.\nLeonard: Okay, that\u2019s enough, Howard.

Howard, you talk to her.\nHoward: Oh no, she\u2019ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.\nRaj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we\u2019d be done.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re not in India.\n\nRaj: Alright, why don\u2019t we do it your way then?

Dennis! Dennis!\nDennis: What?\nGablehouser: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.\nDennis: Um, no thanks. I\u2019m going to the mall with Emma.\n\nGablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh\u2026.\nLeonard: The kid got a girl.\nRaj: Unbelievable.\nHoward: Did anyone see how he did it?\nGablehouser): Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me.

It\u2019s Dennis Kim.\nHoward: Wow, I almost didn\u2019t recognise him.\nRaj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.\nLeonard: Yeah, we really ruined his life.\n\nHoward: Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There\u2019s going to be a scene depicting Spock\u2019s birth.\nRaj: I\u2019d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock\u2019s conception.\nSheldon: Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it\u2019s an extremely private matter.\nLeonard: Still, I\u2019d like to know the details.

Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?\nLeonard: Come on, you need a four person team, we\u2019re four people.\nSheldon: By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.\n\nRaj: Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.\nHoward: How about the perpetual motion squad? It\u2019s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.\nLeonard: The ladies?\nHoward: Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.\nRaj: I like it.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t.

No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.\nLeonard: Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?\nSheldon: I will yield.\n\nLeonard: After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?\nSheldon: He does.\nLeonard: I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?\nPenny: Good afternoon, and welcome to today\u2019s physics bowl practice round.

He only has a problem when they\u2019re one on one and smell nice.\nPenny: Oh, thanks Raj, it\u2019s vanilla oil.\nLeonard: I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let\u2019s just start.\n\nPenny: Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.\nPenny: That is correct.\nLeonard: I knew that too.\nPenny: Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.\nPenny: Right.\nHoward: Hey, I buzzed in.\n\nSheldon: But I answered, it\u2019s called teamwork.\nHoward: Don\u2019t you think I should answer the engineering questions?

It\u2019s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce.

This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.\nLeonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?\n\nSheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.\nLeonard: What if I knocked you unconscious right now?\nSheldon: It won\u2019t change the past.\n",
      "DATE: April 1, 2008\nLeonard: But it would make the present so much nicer.\nSheldon: Are you upset about something?\nLeonard: What was your first clue?\nSheldon: Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability\u2026\n\nLeonard: Yes I\u2019m upset.\nSheldon: Oh! I don\u2019t usually pick up on those things. Good for me.\nLeonard: Yeah, good for you.\nSheldon: Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what\u2019s bothering you?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe.\nSheldon: Wow, I\u2019m on fire tonight.\nLeonard: Uh, here\u2019s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.\nSheldon: I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.\n\nLeonard: Come on, guys, push.\n(off): If I push any harder I\u2019m going to give birth to my colon.\napartment): Oh, hey guys.\nSheldon): Uh, hi Penny.  Take a break, guys!\nPenny: What are you doing?\n",
      "DATE: April 1, 2008\nLeonard: Oh, just, you know, moving a\u2026 time machine.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so\u2026.\nLeonard: No problem.  Hang on.\nPenny: But, what about your time machine.\nLeonard: Some things are more important than toys.\n\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m scared.\nLeonard: Don\u2019t worry baby, I\u2019ve got you.\nPenny: Oh, Leonard.\nSheldon: It\u2019s still my turn.\nSheldon: What are you doing?\nLeonard: I\u2019m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.\nSheldon: Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not about money.\n(entering): We brought food.\nHoward: Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.\n\nLeonard: Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?\nRaj: Why?\nLeonard: Because I don\u2019t want it any more.\nHoward: Why?\nLeonard: Just\u2026 personal reasons.\nSheldon: My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.\n",
      "DATE: April 1, 2008\nLeonard: Look, do you want to buy me out or not?\nRaj: I\u2019ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we\u2019ll put it on my balcony.\n\nHoward: Screw his balcony, I\u2019ll give you a hundred and twenty and we\u2019ll put it in my garage.\nLeonard: I paid two hundred dollars for my share.\nRaj: Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.\nSheldon: I\u2019ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.\nRaj: Three hundred, and I\u2019ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.\n\nLeonard: No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I\u2019m getting rid of all of it.\nHoward: You can\u2019t do that, look what you\u2019ve created here, it\u2019s like nerdvana.\nRaj: More importantly, you\u2019ve a Darth Vader voice changer?\nLeonard: Not for long.\nRaj: Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.\nHoward: Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.\n",
      "DATE: April 1, 2008\nRaj: Too bad, I called dibs.\n\nHoward: Well you can\u2019t just call dibs.\nRaj: I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.\nSheldon: Dibs doesn\u2019t apply in a bidding war.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not a bidding war, I\u2019m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.\nRaj: Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?\nHoward: Will you forget dibs!\nLeonard: He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.\nSheldon: What\u2019s the number, I\u2019ll match it.\nRaj: I\u2019ll match it, plus a thousand rupees.\n\nSheldon: What\u2019s the exchange rate.\nRaj: None of your business. Take it or leave it.\nphone): Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.\nLeonard: Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.\nSheldon: Who cares, as long as you pick me.\nRaj: Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let\u2019s talk.\nLeonard: Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.\n\n",

I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.\nHoward: Okay man, be cool, we\u2019re all friends here.\nflat): What the hell\u2019s going on?\nSheldon: You hypocrite!\nPenny: What?\n\nSheldon: Little Miss \u201cgrown ups don\u2019t play with toys\u201d. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!\nPenny: Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.\nLeonard: No, I needed to hear it.\n\n"

Amy?\nSheldon: Leonard, be glad you can\u2019t keep a woman. They are a handful.\n\nAmy: Oh, look. It\u2019s Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.\nLeonard: Hi, Amy.\nAmy: Hey, Cuddles.\nLeonard: Cuddles?\nSheldon: Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.\nLeonard: Amy, what are you doing here?\nAmy: Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you\u2019re sad.\nLeonard: Yeah, but why didn\u2019t you go back to your apartment?\n\nAmy: Didn\u2019t you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.\n",

You work the lunch shift?\nPenny: Yeah. I\u2019ve got eight pounds of salmon that\u2019s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?\nLeonard: Not really.\nPenny: Damn it.

It\u2019s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.\nLeonard: Sounds like most of my dates.\n\napproach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!\nPenny: What is that about?\nLeonard: Well, he\u2019s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster.\nSheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!\nLeonard: What the hell is going on?\nSheldon: There\u2019s a bird outside the window, and he won\u2019t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.\nPenny: Really? On top of everything else, you\u2019re afraid of birds?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building.

Go away, bird.\nLeonard: Sheldon, just ignore him.\nSheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Oh, much better. All right. Now I\u2019ll just get along with my life.  Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It\u2019s going to be a long night.\nLeonard: The bird\u2019s still there?\nSheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know. Scree-scree.\n\nSheldon: Please, that\u2019s a seagull. If you\u2019re not going to help, don\u2019t help.\nLeonard: Sorry. Do you think I\u2019m overdressed?\nSheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you\u2019re playing Vegas, I\u2019d add sequins.\nLeonard: I\u2019m going to the movies with Penny. I don\u2019t want her to think that I think it\u2019s a date.\n",

I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m wearing this.\n\nSheldon: Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\u2019m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I\u2019d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I\u2019m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don\u2019t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you\u2019re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you\u2019re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don\u2019t you think I tried making cat noises?\n\ncap): Too casual?\n",

My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.\nRaj: Hummingbirds are pretty.\nSheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.\n\nRaj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.\n",

Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?\nRaj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.\nHoward: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s not a death ray. It\u2019s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn\u2019t be living here. I\u2019d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one.\nRaj: That is one tough birdie.\n\nSheldon: This is ridiculous. I\u2019m a grown man from Texas. This isn\u2019t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It\u2019s just a blue jay.  That\u2019s a pretty big blue jay.  One, two, three.  Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay!  Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment!  No!\n",

That\u2019s a living thing, get cracking.\n\nBernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.\nAmy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.\nSheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.\nBernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he\u2019s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone\u2019s pet.\nSheldon: No, Bernadette, don\u2019t be a hero!\nBernadette: Oh, he\u2019s a sweetie.\n\nSheldon: Yes. It\u2019s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.\nAmy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it.

Oh, dear. I just realized I haven\u2019t offered you a beverage.\nBernadette: Oh, it\u2019s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.\n\nSheldon: My phone\u2019s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I\u2019d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn\u2019t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You\u2019re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren\u2019t you?\nAmy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.\nBernadette: I still think he looks like someone\u2019s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.\n\n",

You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.\nAmy: If you\u2019re keeping him, I\u2019ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.\n\nSheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn\u2019t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I\u2019m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn\u2019t that right, LD?  No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He\u2019s gone.\nAmy: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon.\n\nSheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!\n",

So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.\n\nLeonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I\u2019m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it\u2019s not like when we were going out, I\u2019d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I\u2019m sorry.\nPenny: All right. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, too.\nLeonard: Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?\nPenny: Way off.\nLeonard: Maybe we\u2019re not ready to hang out as friends.\n\nPenny: I don\u2019t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.\nLeonard: Really?\nPenny: Yeah.\n",

Because if that\u2019s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I\u2019ll be anything you want me to be.\nPenny: Good night, Leonard.\n\nHoward: It\u2019s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.\nLeonard: It\u2019s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.\nHoward: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.\nSheldon: Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?\n\nAmy: Sheldon, I\u2019m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you\u2019re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.\n",
      "DATE: February 3, 2012\nSheldon: Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that\u2019s cool.\nStuart: Can I help you find anything?\nAmy: A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can\u2019t be used as a floatation device.\n\nStuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.\nRaj: Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka\u2019a expansion pack is out.\nHoward: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It\u2019s like a secret tax on guys who can\u2019t get laid.\n\nRaj: They\u2019re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?\nHoward: Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?\n",
      "DATE: February 3, 2012\nRaj: A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.\n\nLeonard: Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid\u2019s cowboy hat?\nHoward: What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we\u2019re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka\u2019a?\nStuart: Leonard, what\u2019s the deal with Sheldon\u2019s friend Amy? Are they a couple?\nLeonard: Couple of weirdos. Why?\nHoward: You interested in Amy?\n\nStuart: Well, I mean, she didn\u2019t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?\nLeonard: Sure. I guess.\nRaj: Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?\n",
      "DATE: February 3, 2012\nStuart: If I tell you that, I\u2019m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 low price of $24.95.\nRaj: I\u2019ll take one.\n\nHoward: Mmm, make it two.\nLeonard: I hate all of you and myself. Three.\nStuart: I\u2019ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.\nLeonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It\u2019s a little awkward.\n\nSheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you\u2019re at, you\u2019re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don\u2019t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.\nLeonard: Yeah, that\u2019s not it. Stuart\u2019s kind of interested in Amy.\n\nSheldon: Oh, of course he is. She\u2019s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?\n",
      "DATE: February 3, 2012\nLeonard: No. He wanted me to find out if you\u2019d have a problem with him asking her out.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don\u2019t own Amy. Can\u2019t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you\u2019re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you\u2019ll have to know.\n\nLeonard: You know what? Never mind. I\u2019m going to tell him it\u2019s okay to ask her out.\nSheldon: The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.\nLeonard: All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you\u2019d feel about it.\n\nSheldon: Where\u2019s Stuart?\n(sniggering): Out.\nSheldon: Who are you?\nGuy: I\u2019m Dale. He left me in charge.\nLeonard: Really?\nDale: Yeah. I don\u2019t get it, either.\n",

Uh, when will Stuart be back?\nDale: I don\u2019t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.\nSheldon: Oh, I guess I was wrong.\n\nLeonard: You okay?\nSheldon: Am I okay? Leonard, I\u2019m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?\nDale: I\u2019m okay, too!\nRaj: Wild Bill Witchcock.\nLeonard: A tribe of Abra-Comanches.\n\nSheldon: Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I\u2019m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We\u2019re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I\u2019m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie.\nHoward: We\u2019re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.\nSheldon: And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?\nLeonard: Yeah.\n",

Let\u2019s just play.\nLeonard: We should go easy on him. Amy\u2019s out with Stuart tonight.\nHoward: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon\u2019s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn\u2019t enough to hold on to a woman?\n\nRaj: Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector\u2019s tin.\nLeonard: Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.\nHoward: Ooh, a sheriff\u2019s badge.\nRaj: Yeah, it\u2019s also a wand.\nLeonard: With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?\nSheldon: I\u2019m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.\nLeonard: You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.

The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?\nLeonard: Okay, how do I look?\nHoward: Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?\nLeonard: What are you talking about?\n\nRaj: Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.\nLeonard: I didn\u2019t defile your sister, we had a relationship.\nRaj: I heard you call her Brown Sugar.

Sandra Bullock.\nHoward: Why?\nRaj: Because she\u2019s great in everything.\nSheldon: Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?\nSheldon: And now that I have some wood, I\u2019m going to begin the erection of my settlement.\nRaj: He\u2019s got to be doing this on purpose.\n\nenters): Ooh, eight thirty.

Hang on a second, mister.\n\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: It\u2019s customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?\nLeonard: No.\nSheldon: Here\u2019s two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t want beef jerky.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not about you.

Out of deference to them, let\u2019s not flaunt our happy relationship.\n\nSheldon: You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.\nLeonard: We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.\nSheldon: Well, I doubt they\u2019d want to talk about that, so we\u2019re fine.\nHoward: I\u2019m surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.\nLeonard: Well, hey, we\u2019re grown-ups. We can still be friends.\nBernadette: Boy, I don\u2019t know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.\nHoward: Why not?\n\nBernadette: I\u2019m a very vengeful person.\nHoward: Really?\nBernadette: With access to weaponised smallpox.\nPenny: Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water.

Alive?\nStuart: Yes.\nSheldon: How about your grandparents, they alive?\nStuart: No.\nSheldon: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.

Implementing power-failure protocol.\n\nLeonard: What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?\nSheldon: Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic.

Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it\u2019ll suck you back in.\nPenny: I think he misses his little buddy.\nLeonard: Fine.

I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t be friends. And I\u2019m willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff.

I\u2019ve got everything we\u2019ll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.\n\nLeonard: You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.\nRaj: Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.\nSheldon: Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re always the good guys. In D&D, we\u2019re lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we\u2019re the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.\n\nSheldon: Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.\nHoward: Hey, guys, I got a surprise.\nLeonard: Uh, if it\u2019s yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.\n",

This is supposed to be our weekend.\n\nHoward: I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don\u2019t we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn\u2019t answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she\u2019s parking the car right now.\nSheldon: Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?\n\nLeonard: Uh, it is, but I think you might\u2019ve waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, it\u2019s still funny.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Hah-hah!\nBernadette: Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!\n",
      "DATE: February 3, 2012\nSheldon: Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn\u2019t as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn\u2019t make the land speeder go.\nBernadette: Pew!\n\nLeonard: Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.\nRaj: Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn\u2019t know how much fun it was killing stuff.\nLeonard: All right, I think we got them all. Let\u2019s divide up the loot.\nBernadette: Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we\u2019ll match.\nHoward: But I worked hard to get this armour.\nBernadette: Sorry, I just thought it\u2019d be nice if people knew we were a couple.\n\nHoward: Fine, I\u2019ll change.\nSheldon: Hah-hah!\nRaj: Bernadette, remember, your character\u2019s the healer in our group. You\u2019re in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.\nBernadette: I can\u2019t help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.\n",

You pick that bone clean!\nAmy: I\u2019m gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.\nPenny: Ooh, burn!\nAmy: And if you don\u2019t start treating me better, I\u2019m leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.\nSheldon: Armin who?\nAmy: Armin\u2026 damn it.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.\nAmy: You\u2019re hurting me.\nPenny: No, Sheldon hurt you.\nAmy: Before; now it\u2019s you.\nPenny: Oh.\n\n",

I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave.

None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I\u2019ll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!\n\nPenny: And that\u2019s how a girl makes a scene. I\u2019m sorry, sweetie. You\u2019re right.

It\u2019s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you\u2019d be familiar with the paradigm.\nPenny: Is Leonard coming?\nSheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.\nPenny: Well, that\u2019s not gonna happen.\nSheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.\nPenny: Which is?\n\nSheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.\nPenny: I\u2019m busy.\nSheldon: Excuse me, miss. I\u2019d like to order lunch.\nPenny: Fine. What do you want?\nSheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?\nPenny: Yes.\nSheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else\u2019s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?\n\n",

If it\u2019s not half of a whole sandwich, it\u2019s just a small sandwich.\nPenny: Okay, fine, it\u2019s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?\nSheldon: Of course not. I\u2019ll have my usual.\nPenny: Great.\nSheldon: Aren\u2019t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?\nPenny: Don\u2019t you usually get lemonade?\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Do you want lemonade?\n\nSheldon: Yes.\nPenny: Anything else?\nSheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.\nPenny: I am not going to apologize. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.\nSheldon: Irrelevant.

Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I\u2019ve committed?\nSheldon: Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?\n\nPenny: Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you\u2019re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?\nSheldon: Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.\nPenny: My singing?\nSheldon: That\u2019s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn\u2019t agree with it.\nPenny: Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn\u2019t he just said so?\n\nSheldon: Because, according to him, you\u2019re oversensitive and have a temper.\n",

It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\nLeonard: Okay, yeah, it\u2019s true, but I can live with that stuff.

He does this thing where he pretends he\u2019s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we\u2019re in, but he can\u2019t perceive us.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I\u2019m just ignoring you.\nPenny: Come on, Sheldon, let\u2019s go home. Look, we\u2019re done fighting.\n\nSheldon: I\u2019ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I\u2019m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad\u2019s meatloaf, and my dad\u2019s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.\nPenny: Okay, there\u2019s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.\nSheldon: Really?

You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Tubs are slippery.\nPenny: I know. I slipped.\nSheldon: I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?\nSheldon: They\u2019re holding umbrellas.\nPenny: What?\n\nSheldon: The ducks in my tub.\nPenny: Uh-huh.\nSheldon: They\u2019re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.\nPenny: Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.\nSheldon: Well, assuming you\u2019re correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.\nPenny: Okay, can you drive me?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t drive.\nPenny: Well, I can\u2019t drive!\nSheldon: Well, it seems we\u2019ve reached an impasse.\n\nPenny: Ow.\n",

Let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.\n\nSheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?\nPenny: I don\u2019t need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.\nSheldon: My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.\nPenny: One was already in an accident.\nSheldon: That doesn\u2019t mean one won\u2019t be in another, especially if I\u2019m driving.\nPenny: Clothes, Sheldon.

Well, that\u2019s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology.

Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?\nPenny: What?\nSheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?\nPenny: It\u2019s not soup, it\u2019s courage.\nSheldon: No, it isn\u2019t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.\nPenny: How did you see it? You said you wouldn\u2019t look.\nSheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.\n\nSheldon: All right, there\u2019s no need to bark at me.

Try not to choke on your own drool.\nPenny: Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I\u2019d say that.\nSheldon: Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.\n\nPenny: You know, people think you\u2019re this weird robot man who\u2019s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it\u2019s like that movie Wall-E at the end.

What are you talking about?\nLeonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.\nSheldon: I see.

I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.\nPenny: Different how?\nHoward: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.\nPenny: Are you high?\nLeonard: You\u2019d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.\n\nHoward: Okay, now you\u2019re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.\nPenny: Howard, you\u2019re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you\u2019re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?\nHoward: Hey, just because you settled doesn\u2019t mean I have to.\nLeonard: Excuse me, I\u2019m sitting here.\nPenny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard.

Yes, you\u2019re delicious caramel, too.\nPenny: All right, you know what, I will tell you why it\u2019s wrong\u2026\nSheldon: Excuse me, may I interject?\n\nRadio: This is Ira Flatow and you\u2019re listening to NPR\u2019s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.\nKripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.\nRadio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.\nSheldon: My pleasure, Ira.\nIra: Now, let\u2019s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?\n\n",
      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles,  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.\nIra: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.\npitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.\n\nSheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I\u2019m going to kill you!\nLeonard: How ya doin\u2019, buddy?\nSheldon: I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I\u2019m doing?\nLeonard: Come on, it wasn\u2019t that bad.\nSheldon: What do you want?\nvoice): We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.\n\n",

All right, he got you, you can get him back.\nSheldon: I refuse to sink to his level.\nRaj: You can\u2019t sink. With all that helium in you, you\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t float away.\nLeonard: Are you really admitting defeat?\nSheldon: I never admit defeat.\nLeonard: Good.\n\nSheldon: However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.\nLeonard: What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?\nRaj: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, dude.\nLeonard: You\u2019re not helping.\nRaj: I didn\u2019t come to help, I came to mock.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.\n",

A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.\nRaj: What\u2019s this?\nSheldon: Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we\u2019re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.\nRaj: Foamy vengeance.\nSheldon: Yes, exactly.\nLeonard: This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke\u2019s office?\n\nSheldon: Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke\u2019s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor\u2019s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.\nRaj: Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.\nSheldon: You flatter me, sir.\n",

The more, the merrier.\n\nSheldon: Wait, no, that\u2019s a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?

In the summer, it\u2019s directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there.

There\u2019s no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.\nPenny: Yeah, okay, cool.

Where\u2019s your notebook?\nPenny: Um, I don\u2019t have one.\nSheldon: How are you going to take notes without a notebook?\nPenny: I have to take notes?\nSheldon: How else are you gonna study for the tests?\nPenny: There\u2019s gonna be a test?\nSheldon: Tests. Here. It\u2019s college-ruled. I hope that\u2019s not too intimidating.\nPenny: Thank you.\n\nSheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It\u2019s at this point that you\u2019ll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.\nPenny: Ancient Greece?\n\n",

There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?\nPenny: Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard\u2019s work?\n\nSheldon: This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we\u2019re going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.\nPenny: Twenty six hundred years?\nSheldon: Yeah, give or take.

      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let\u2019s plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?\nPenny: Uh, we know that\u2026 Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?\nSheldon: No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don\u2019t write that down!\n\nPenny: Sorry.\nSheldon: Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?\nPenny: I don\u2019t know.\nSheldon: How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?\nPenny: Hey! You don\u2019t have to be so mean!\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry.

Well, that doesn\u2019t sound so complicated.\nSheldon: It\u2019s not. That\u2019s why Leonard does it.\nPenny: Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?\nSheldon: A good question.\nPenny: Thank you.\n\nPenny: Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch\u2019s heart grows three sizes.\nSheldon: Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.\nHalls): Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.\nPenny: You really didn\u2019t like it, Sheldon?\n\nSheldon: No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.\nLeonard: When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.\n",

It makes me feel like a little girl again.\nLeonard: We didn\u2019t have a tree when I was growing up.\nPenny: Really? Why not?\nLeonard: Mmm, in my family, holidays weren\u2019t so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.\nPenny: Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?\nLeonard: Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

It\u2019s a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.\nPenny: Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.\nSheldon: Wait, excuse me, but it\u2019s much more Christmassy than anything you\u2019ve put on the tree.\nLeonard: Here we go.\n\nSheldon: December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.\nLeonard: Merry Newton-mas, everyone.\nSheldon: I sense that\u2019s not sincere, although I have no idea why.\n\nPenny: No, it\u2019s fine.

I\u2019m adorable.\nLeonard: You are, it\u2019s just\u2026\n\nSheldon: If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners.

Oh, no offense, dear.\nPenny: No, it sounded like a compliment.\nLeonard: When did this happen?\nBeverley: Mmm, well, let\u2019s see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard\u2019s father?\nSheldon: September 22nd.\nBeverley: Oh, yes, that\u2019s right. The weekend after Leonard\u2019s dog died.\nLeonard: Mitzy\u2019s dead?\nSheldon: She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?\n\nLeonard: I don\u2019t believe this.

This is my tea.\nLeonard: Then why are you telling me?\nSheldon: It\u2019s a conversation starter.\nLeonard: That\u2019s a lousy conversation starter.\nSheldon: Oh, is it? We\u2019re conversing. Checkmate.\nLeonard: What do you want, Sheldon?\nSheldon: What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.\nLeonard: I want that too. Why are you here?\n\nSheldon: To comfort you, of course. No, that\u2019s not going to work at all, I\u2019ll comfort you from over here.

The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you\u2019re feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.\nLeonard: You\u2019re right, I do feel better.\nSheldon: Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.\nLeonard: You\u2019re my surrogate family?\nSheldon: If it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m not happy about it either.

Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I\u2019m a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.\nLeonard: What are you trying to tell me, Howard?\n\nHoward: There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don\u2019t want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.\n",

At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it\u2019s a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy\u2019s. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.\nSheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that\u2019s linked to race riots in the 1940s.\nRaj: Race riots?\nSheldon: The zoot suit riots.\n\nRaj: Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don\u2019t we just go to the galleria and walk around?\nSheldon: I don\u2019t need anything at the Galleria.

Let\u2019s go outside. Outside is good.\nSheldon: If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?\n\nRaj: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I\u2019m a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.\nSheldon: Let me offer you a compromise.

So you were the victim of a crime. That\u2019s part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.\nSheldon: I am moving on.

Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that.

I usually just have coffee.

If you\u2019re going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.\nLeonard: Aye, aye, Captain.\n\nSheldon: I can\u2019t see it!

Your mom\u2019s not coming, right?\nHoward: Not this time, I promise.\nRaj: Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I\u2019m very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.\nSheldon: The plural of coccyx is coccyges.\nRaj: Screw you.

Is that a physics thing?\nLeonard: No, that\u2019s a crazy thing.\nBernadette: Okay, Sheldon.

Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.\nAssistant: No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.\nSheldon: I could do that.\nAssistant: Good.\nSheldon: One question.\nAssistant: Yes?\nSheldon: What\u2019s sheetrock?\n\nAssistant: Moving on.

If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.\nLeonard: Why are you doing this?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour.

I just hope you\u2019ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.\nPenny: I\u2019ll talk to Leonard.\nSheldon: You will?\nPenny: Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.\nher): Oh, Penny, thank you!\nPenny: You\u2019re welcome.\n\nSheldon: Since I rarely hug, I\u2019m relying on your expertise regarding duration.\nPenny: I think we\u2019re there.\nSheldon: Oh, good. Bye-bye.\nRaj: You know what? Even though I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine\u2019s Day.\nHoward: Trust me, you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried.\n\nRaj: No, no, no, I\u2019m going to have a me day. First I\u2019m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I\u2019m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.\n",

It\u2019s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I\u2019m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.\n\nLeonard: You\u2019re not going to Switzerland!\nSheldon: Oh, but I am. Didn\u2019t Penny tell you the good news?\nLeonard: She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.\nSheldon: Yes, that good news.\nLeonard: Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it\u2019s Penny, not you!\nSheldon: Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?\nLeonard: Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.\nSheldon: Really?\nLeonard: Yeah, really.\n",

I\u2019m sick.\nPenny: Yeah, well, I\u2019m sick, too.\n\nLeonard: Will you please turn your shirt off?\nRaj: What? I\u2019m giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I\u2019m awesome and to be feared.\nHoward: Yeah, right, there\u2019s nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who\u2019s got music blasting from between his nipples.\nLeonard: Hey, Stuart, what\u2019s going on?\nStuart: Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.\n",

My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan\u2019s doing him a favour.\nSheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?\nLeonard: Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.\nSheldon: Well, look who thinks he\u2019s Stuart\u2019s uncle now.\nRaj: Can\u2019t believe it. We\u2019re going to meet Stan Lee!\n\nHoward: I\u2019m sad to say I taught him those moves.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom.  Alex, I\u2019m going to go with what is\u2026 you\u2019re a dumbass?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month\u2019s Batman.\nHoward: That\u2019s crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.\n\n",
      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.\nRaj: That\u2019s a great idea, I\u2019m going to get him to sign a Batman as well.\nSheldon: What is it about the word unique you don\u2019t understand?\nHoward: Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.\nRaj: Well, obviously you don\u2019t remember your circumcision.\n\nSheldon: There\u2019s Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.\nHoward: Why don\u2019t you keep that stuff in the bathroom?\nLeonard: He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.\nSheldon: Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.\nPenny: Hi!\nLeonard: Hey. Guess who\u2019s going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?\nPenny: Um, can you give me a hint?\nLeonard: Stan Lee.\nPenny: Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?\n\nLeonard: No, no, Stan Lee.\nPenny: Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!\n",

So, is this Bruce Lee\u2019s nerdy brother, Stan?\nHoward: Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?\nSheldon: Because most of the things I\u2019m planning to buy haven\u2019t been invented yet.\nHoward: But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don\u2019t you put it in the bank?\n\nSheldon: I don\u2019t trust banks.

      "DATE: February 1, 2010\nSheldon: Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it\u2019s supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?\nSheldon: It bothers me.\nHoward: Sheldon, this is a summons.\nSheldon: A summons for what?\n\nHoward: Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.\nSheldon: November 16? Penny, that\u2019s the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.\nPenny: No, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Yes, it is.\nPenny: No, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that\u2019s a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.\n\nPenny: Mmm, no, it isn\u2019t.\nSheldon: Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?\n",

I told them I wasn\u2019t driving and they were all, if it wasn\u2019t you, who was it?\nSheldon: So you betrayed me?\nPenny: No! It wasn\u2019t a betrayal. It was more of a can\u2019t afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.\n\nSheldon: But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.\nPenny: Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.\nLeonard: It\u2019s not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not going to pay a fine. That would imply I\u2019m guilty.\nHoward: You are guilty.  That one I liked.\n\nSheldon: I am not guilty. I only have a learner\u2019s permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.\n",

On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I\u2019m going to begin preparing my defence right now.\n\nHoward: Okay, he\u2019s going to jail.\nhim): Oh, that\u2019s right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.\nSheldon: Now you see what you\u2019ve done? Because of you, we\u2019re all going to miss Stan Lee.\nLeonard: Whoa! What do you mean all?\nSheldon: Well, you\u2019re my friends. You\u2019ll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I\u2019m victorious.\nLeonard: Yeah, okay. No.\n\nSheldon: Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?\nLeonard: That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\nSheldon: Howard?\n",

Penny.\ndoor):  Penny.\nSheldon: That\u2019s just wrong.\nPenny: All right, let\u2019s go.\nSheldon: Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I\u2019d like to call on your skills as an actress.\nPenny: What is this?\nSheldon: I\u2019ve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?\nPenny: Do I have a choice?\n\nSheldon: Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?\n",

Go on.\n\nPenny: The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I\u2019ve ever seen in, like, ever.\nSheldon: And who performed that heroic act?\nPenny: Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.\nSheldon: There\u2019s no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.\n\nPenny: But it is a fact that it\u2019s a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?\nSheldon: Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.\ntears): But it is a fact that it\u2019s a privilege to know you.

Anyway, if it would please the court, I\u2019d like to begin with an opening statement.\nJudge: The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.\n\nSheldon: Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I\u2019m unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.\n\nJudge: Impressive.\nSheldon: Thank you.\nJudge: Guilty. Pay the cashier.\nSheldon: I object. You\u2019re completely ignoring the law.\n",

I never apologize for the truth.\n\nSheldon: That\u2019s my spot.\nSheldon: Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?\nGuard: What?\nSheldon: I need to use the restroom.\nGuard: Knock yourself out.\nSheldon: That\u2019s the toilet?\nGuard: Well, it ain\u2019t a wishing well.\nSheldon: Please tell the judge I\u2019m ready to apologize.\nLeonard: Look at that.

As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.\nSheldon: I also now have three points on a driver\u2019s licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.\nHoward: Plus, you didn\u2019t get to meet Stan Lee.\nLeonard: Okay, that\u2019s enough, Howard.

In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I\u2019m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails.

It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.\nHoward: Fine.

You hit me! I\u2019m bleeding!\nLeonard: What was that?\n\nHoward: So, Sheldon, how\u2019s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?\nSheldon: It\u2019s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I\u2019d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I\u2019d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.\nRaj: Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: I was afraid of that.

One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.\n\nLeonard: No Jet Skis.\nVenkatesh: All right, forget the Jet Skis.\nRaj: Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to \u201ctear them a new one?\u201d\nVenkatesh: What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.\nRaj: You\u2019re useless.\nVenkatesh: I told you that when you hired me.\nRaj: I\u2019m signing off now.\nVenkatesh: Call your mother, she worries.\n\nHoward: Okay, just so you know, if we\u2019re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.\n",

For example, why wasn\u2019t William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?\nLeonard: Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s Award for Science.\n\nSheldon: And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again?

What you can\u2019t do is shut up.\nRaj: Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.\nSheldon: I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.\nLeonard: What, to you, is a large crowd?\nSheldon: Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.\n\nPenny: Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, \u2019cause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.\n",

Let me tell you a story.\n\nHoward: Where\u2019s 70 children when you need \u2018em?\nSheldon: I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college.

Leonard?\n\nLeonard: I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.\nSheldon: What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?\nLeonard: My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I\u2019ve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.\nHoward: Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don\u2019t know, some Indian meditation crap.\n\nSheldon: I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you\u2019re saving the most impressive contribution for last.

Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.\nHoward: Oh, that\u2019s not a good name.\nRaj: Okay, Sheldon. I\u2019m going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.\nSheldon: And yet, you can\u2019t speak to women.\nRaj: True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.\n\nSheldon: Okay, but don\u2019t punch me.\nRaj: What?\nSheldon: When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you\u2019ll get a surprise, and then she\u2019d punch me.\nRaj: I\u2019m not going to punch you.\nSheldon: That\u2019s what my sister used to say.\n",

Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don\u2019t feel they deserve them.

To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you\u2019re out there.

I kid the geologists, of course, but it\u2019s only \u2019cause I have no respect for the field. Let\u2019s get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? \u2018Cause we\u2019re scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what\u2019s the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.

You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?\n\nHoward: What\u2019s with him?\nSheldon: Perhaps he\u2019s at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.\nHoward: Are you saying he\u2019s man-struating?\nSheldon: Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men\u2019s hormone levels.\nRaj: Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month.

No.\nRaj: I\u2019m just asking, dude. It happens.\nStuart: You guys still on for bowling tonight?\nSheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, I\u2019ve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.\nStuart: Oh. Ouch.\n\nSheldon: That is what is referred to as a burn on you.\nHoward: Did you ask her to start waxing?\nLeonard: No.\nRaj: Did you start waxing?\nLeonard: No.\nHoward: While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?\nLeonard: I\u2019m walking away from you now.\nHoward: That wasn\u2019t a no.\nRaj: Yeah, I think we\u2019re getting close.\n",

There\u2019s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.\n\nLeonard: Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.\nSheldon: I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there\u2019s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn\u2019t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.\nLeonard: I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll still love him.\nSheldon: I wouldn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Well, what do you want to do?\nSheldon: I want to leave.\nLeonard: Okay.\n\nSheldon: What\u2019s the protocol for leaving?\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.\n",

Two millimetres?

Again.\nPenny: Hi.\nSheldon: Hi.\nLeonard: Hi.\nPenny: Hi.\n\nLeonard: Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um.

In the summer it\u2019s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there.

Okay, let\u2019s see, what else, oh, I\u2019m a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.\nSheldon: That\u2019s interesting.

Is that crazy?\nSheldon: Yes.\n\nLeonard: No, it\u2019s not crazy it\u2019s, uh, uh, it\u2019s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn\u2019t make it worse.\nPenny: Oh, I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m such a mess, and on top of everything else I\u2019m all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn\u2019t even work.\nLeonard: Our shower works.\n\nPenny: Really?

A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend.

Wow, how many Superman movies are there?\nSheldon: You\u2019re kidding, right?\nPenny: Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?\ntogether: One. .\n\nSheldon: You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.\nPenny: Yes, I know, men can\u2019t fly.\nSheldon: Oh no, let\u2019s assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.\nLeonard: Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.\n\n",

The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.\nSheldon: Exactly half.\n(snarkily): Exactly half. Let\u2019s push.

The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid.

Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I\u2019d just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.\nLeonard: Interesting.\nSheldon: Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.\nLeonard: Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover?\n\nSheldon: It\u2019s time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that.\nLeonard: Then I guess congratulations are in order.\nSheldon: No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I\u2019m not going to enjoy this party.\nLeonard: I know, I\u2019m familiar with you.\nSheldon: At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.\nLeonard: Yes, I was there.\nSheldon: You know what\u2019s interesting about caves, Leonard?\nLeonard: What?\nSheldon: Nothing.\n\n",

Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you\u2019ve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.\nLeonard: Mahalo\u2019s a nice touch.\n\nSheldon: Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.\nLeonard: Interesting, you should lead with that.\nRaj: Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.\nLeonard: You don\u2019t have buffets in India?\nRaj: Of course, but it\u2019s all Indian food. You can\u2019t find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.\nSheldon: Well here\u2019s an interesting turn of events.\nLeonard: What.  Howard brought a date?\n\nSheldon: A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.\n",

How was that?\n\nLeonard: Morning\nSheldon: Morning.\nLeonard: You\u2019re making eggs for breakfast?\nSheldon: This isn\u2019t breakfast, it\u2019s an experiment.\nLeonard: Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.\nSheldon: I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.\nLeonard: Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.\nSheldon: As do I.\nLeonard: You know, I\u2019m sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.\n\n",

Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I\u2019m going to savour it.\nLeonard: Okay. I\u2019ll let you get back to fixing your eggs.\nSheldon: I\u2019m not just fixing my eggs, I\u2019m fixing everyone\u2019s eggs.\nLeonard: And we all thank you.\nSheldon: Use new eggs. .\n\nround): Hi, hey. I\u2019m running out to the market, do you guys need anything?\nSheldon: Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.\nPenny: I\u2019m sorry?\nSheldon: I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.\nPenny: Four dozen?\nSheldon: Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.\nPenny: Okay, one more time?\nSheldon: Never mind, you won\u2019t get it right, I\u2019d better come with you.\n\nPenny: Oh, yay!\n",

But yeah.\nPenny: Well, maybe it\u2019s all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens.\nSheldon: No it doesn\u2019t. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved.\n\nPenny: No, no, I meant\u2026\nSheldon: Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.\nPenny: Never mind.\nSheldon: Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.\nPenny: We\u2019re fine.\nSheldon: Look, you\u2019re not leaving yourself enough space between cars.\nPenny: Oh, sure I am.\nSheldon: No, no.

Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let\u2019s say, 4,400lb.\nPenny: Let\u2019s say 4,390.\n\nSheldon: Fine. We\u2019re travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let\u2019s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we\u2019ll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and\u2026 oh look, they built a new put-put course.\nSheldon: This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.\nPenny: Thank you.\n\nSheldon: No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person.

Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you\u2019ll really enjoy this, is, they\u2019re shelved with the vegetables, but they\u2019re technically a fruit.\nPenny: Interesting.\nSheldon: Isn\u2019t it?\nPenny: No, I mean what you find enjoyable.\nsupplements): Oh boy.\nPenny: What now?\nSheldon: Well, there\u2019s some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you\u2019re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.\n\nPenny: Well, maybe that\u2019s what I was going for.\nSheldon: Well then you\u2019ll want some manganese.\nSheldon: That was fun.

For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month\u2019s supply at a time.\nPenny: What?\n\nSheldon: Well think about it, it\u2019s a product that doesn\u2019t spoil, and you\u2019re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.\nPenny: You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?\nSheldon: Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?\nPenny: Okay, I\u2019m not talking about this with you.\n\nSheldon: Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we\u2019re talking about statistically significant savings.

Okay, no warehouse store, but we\u2019re still on for put-put golf, right?\n(entering): Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.\nSheldon: I think it\u2019s her time of the month.

Mom, what are you doing here?\n",

This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone\u2019s mother.\n\nLeonard: Really, when was the last time you left the house.\nSheldon: I went to the market with Penny.\nLeonard: That was three weeks ago.\nSheldon: Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she\u2019s going to get very crabby.\nCooper: Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.\nSheldon: Yes, well I\u2019m not a child, I\u2019m a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit.

I read it before I threw it out.\n\nLeonard: Okay\u2026 if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.\nSheldon: Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn\u2019t recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech.

Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.\nPenny: Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.\nSheldon: Okay, sure. I don\u2019t see a problem with that.\n\nPenny: There\u2019s no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn\u2019t that right Leonard.\nLeonard: Well\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\n",

Because he didn\u2019t want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.\n\near): No, I\u2019m lost too, I think she skipped a step.\nPenny: No, look, Sheldon\u2019s cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he\u2019s in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family\u2019s going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he\u2019s such a good man.\nLeonard: Oh, another hug, thank you.\nPenny: Alright you guys, good luck.\nLeonard: Thanks Penny.\nHoward: Yeah, uh, break a leg.\nSheldon: Break a leg.\nHoward: So, road trip to Long Beach.\n\nLeonard: No, we\u2019re not going to Long Beach.\nRaj: Why not?\nLeonard: Because Sheldon doesn\u2019t have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nRaj: Oh, too bad. I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.\nSheldon: It\u2019s a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it\u2019s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.\nRaj: Sounds fun.\nHoward: I\u2019m game.\nRaj: Shotgun.\n\nSheldon: No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it\u2019s iffy.\nLeonard: Wait, are we really going to Long Beach?\nSheldon:  Leonard,  Leonard,  Leonard\u2026\nLeonard: Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.\nSheldon: No, that\u2019s the least of our worries. I\u2019ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there\u2019s a problem with the current version of our lie.\n\nLeonard: What are you talking about, it\u2019s fine, she bought it, it\u2019s over.\nSheldon: Sadly, it\u2019s not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nLeonard: Why not?\nSheldon: Because Leo is a middle child.\nLeonard: There is no Leo, how can you say that?\n\nSheldon: You didn\u2019t read the bio, did you? He\u2019s not just a middle child, he\u2019s the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.\nLeonard: I\u2019ve got a solution.\nSheldon: Great, what is it?\nLeonard: Get out.\n\nman: Morning.\nLeonard: Who are you?\nMan: I am Sheldon\u2019s cousin Leo.\nLeonard: Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.\nMan: Au contraire. I\u2019m 26 years old, I\u2019m originally from  Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I\u2019ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.\n\nSheldon: Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.\n",

Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.\nLeonard: Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?\nSheldon: Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.\nLeonard: Oh\u2026!\nToby: Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.\n\nSheldon: No. We\u2019re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.\nToby: Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?\nSheldon: Subtextually, of course.  Just have fun with it.  Morning Penny.\n",

How did the intervention go.\nSheldon: Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t able to convince him to go to rehab.\nPenny: Well, based on what you told me, I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nSheldon: But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.\nPenny: Hi Leo, how are you feeling?\nToby: Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?\nPenny: No.\nToby: Then don\u2019t ask me how I\u2019m feeling.\nLeonard: Well, that\u2019s Leo. Hey, um, why don\u2019t you tell me about your showcase last night?\n\nPenny: Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn\u2019t a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.\nLeonard: There were only two people there?\nPenny: By the end.

Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.\nSheldon: Don\u2019t forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.\nToby: That\u2019s never been proven.\nSheldon: There have been studies.\n\nToby: Not double blind studies.\nSheldon: How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group.\nLeonard: As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let\u2019s give them some privacy.\nPenny: Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?\nLeonard: Sounds good.\nPenny: I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it?\nLeonard: Gee, why wouldn\u2019t I?\nPenny: This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.\n\n",

You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nSheldon: Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.\n\nPenny: So, you\u2019ve got a bit of competition, I really don\u2019t see what the big deal is.\nSheldon: Well of course you don\u2019t, you\u2019ve never excelled at anything.\nPenny: I don\u2019t understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?\nHoward: We liked Leonard.\nLeonard: Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?\n\nSheldon: Yes. That\u2019s what a rational person does when his entire life\u2019s work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.\nPenny: You know, I\u2019m confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?\nSheldon: Hey.\nLeonard: Hey.\nSheldon: I\u2019ve decided you\u2019re right. My career is not over.\nLeonard: Great.\n\nSheldon: But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: So I\u2019ve decided, I\u2019m going to collaborate with you.\nLeonard: Great.\nSheldon: What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I\u2019ve never really paid attention.\nLeonard: Okay, well, right now I\u2019m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don\u2019t need any help.\n\nSheldon: Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what\u2019s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?\nLeonard: Yes.\nSheldon: No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?\nLeonard: It would blow up.\nSheldon: Are you sure?\nLeonard: Pretty sure.\nSheldon: Pretty sure\u2019s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?\n\nphone): It\u2019s a small brown paper bag, Ma, I\u2019m looking at it right now.  Why would I make that up, there\u2019s no ding-dong in it.  How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?\n(entering): So, this is engineering, huh?\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nphone): I\u2019ll talk to you later.\nSheldon: Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.\nHoward: Sheldon, what are you doing here?\nSheldon: I just came by to say hello.\n\nHoward: I\u2019ve been at this lab for three years, you\u2019ve never came by to say hello.\nSheldon: Well, up until now I\u2019ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?\nHoward: A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that\u2019s going up on the next space shuttle.\nSheldon: Really, how does it work?\nHoward: When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.\nSheldon: Uh, huh. So it\u2019s a shelf?\n\nHoward: No, you don\u2019t understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide\u2026 yeah, okay, it\u2019s a shelf.\nSheldon: Now, I notice you\u2019re using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they\u2019re lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nHoward: Sheldon, there\u2019s a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.\nSheldon: And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.\nHoward: Sheldon.\n\n(entering): Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?\nSheldon: No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you\u2019ll appreciate this, very exciting.\nGablehouser: Oh, what are you working on?\nSheldon: Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I\u2019ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I\u2019m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.\nGablehouser: To what end?\n\nSheldon: You know, it\u2019s like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.\nGablehouser: Who will come?\nSheldon: The Jewish people.\nGablehouser: What if they don\u2019t come.\nSheldon: We\u2019ll make it nice, put out a spread.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nGablehouser: Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we\u2019re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who\u2019s agreed to join us here at the University.\nSheldon: Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can\u2019t you.\n\nGablehouser: Okay, well, uh, obviously you\u2019re very busy with your\u2026 uh, um, come Dennis. You\u2019ll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he\u2019s been under a lot of\u2026 um\u2026 he\u2019s nuts.\ntune): Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They\u2019ll come, they\u2019ll settle and I\u2019ll win the prize\u2026\nSheldon: I really don\u2019t understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn\u2019t the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?\nGoldfarb: Go away.\nSheldon: We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.\n\nGoldfarb: Please go away.\nSheldon: Said Pharoah to Moses.\nGablehouser: Why are all these young women here?\nLeonard: It\u2019s take your daughter to work day.\nGablehouser: Really, I was not aware of that.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nRaj: Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.\nGablehouser: Hm?\nHoward: Smooth.\nRaj: Thank you.\nGablehouser: There\u2019s the man of the hour.\n\nLeonard: Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.\nHoward: All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.\nLeonard: Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?\nRaj: We need a social catalyst.\nLeonard: Like what? We can\u2019t get fifteen year-old girls drunk.\nHoward: Or can we?\nLeonard: No, we can\u2019t.\nHoward: I don\u2019t think you mean we can\u2019t. I think you mean we shouldn\u2019t.\n\nSheldon: Hey, Howard. You\u2019re a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it\u2019s definitely me.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nLeonard: Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.\nRaj: Okay. How about that one.\n\nHoward: Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won\u2019t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you\u2019re in the back seat of your mom\u2019s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.\nRaj: Are you crying?\nHoward: No, I have allergies.\nRaj: Okay, uh, how about her?\n\nLeonard: Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you\u2019re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she\u2019s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn\u2019t even know you.\nRaj: Okay, so not her either. How about her?\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nHoward: Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.\n\nLeonard: I think that\u2019s our girl. One of us should go talk to her.\nRaj: I can\u2019t talk to her, you do it.\nLeonard: I can\u2019t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.\nHoward: Oh no, she\u2019ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.\nRaj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we\u2019d be done.\nLeonard: Well, we\u2019re not in India.\n\nRaj: Alright, why don\u2019t we do it your way then? We\u2019ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.\nLeonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.\nRaj: You started it, dude.\nGablehouser: Could I have everyone\u2019s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We\u2019re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.\n(sarcastically): Welcome Dennis Kim.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nGablehouser: Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.\nSheldon: Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!\nGablehouser: And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!\nDennis: What?\nGablehouser: Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.\nDennis: Um, no thanks. I\u2019m going to the mall with Emma.\n\nGablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh\u2026.\nLeonard: The kid got a girl.\nRaj: Unbelievable.\nHoward: Did anyone see how he did it?\nGablehouser): Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.\nHoward: He\u2019s back.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nHoward: Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.\nLeonard: I don\u2019t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman \u201cyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.\u201d\nRaj: Hey, look at that.  It\u2019s Dennis Kim.\nHoward: Wow, I almost didn\u2019t recognise him.\nRaj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.\nLeonard: Yeah, we really ruined his life.\n\nHoward: Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There\u2019s going to be a scene depicting Spock\u2019s birth.\nRaj: I\u2019d be more interested in a scene depicting Spock\u2019s conception.\nSheldon: Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it\u2019s an extremely private matter.\nLeonard: Still, I\u2019d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn\u2019t just conceive.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nHoward: Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock\u2019s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.\nRaj: How come on Star Trek everybody\u2019s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.\n(entering): Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it\u2019s just going \u201caaaaaaa\u201d.\nLeonard: What did you spill on it?\nPenny: Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.\n\nLeonard: I\u2019ll take a look at it.\nHoward: Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren\u2019t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year.\nLeonard: You\u2019re kidding, why not?\nHoward: They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm.\nPenny: Wow, so in your world, you\u2019re like, the cool guys.\nHoward: Recognise.\nLeonard: This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.\n\nPenny: Zod?\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nHoward: Kryptonian villain. Long story.\nRaj: Good story.\nSheldon: Well count me out.\nHoward: What? Why?\nSheldon: You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?\nLeonard: Come on, you need a four person team, we\u2019re four people.\nSheldon: By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.\n\nRaj: Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.\nHoward: How about the perpetual motion squad? It\u2019s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.\nLeonard: The ladies?\nHoward: Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.\nRaj: I like it.\nSheldon: I don\u2019t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.\nRaj: Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.\nSheldon: Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.\n\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nRaj: Maybe so. But you can\u2019t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.\nLeonard: Let\u2019s put it to a vote. All those in favour\u2026.\nSheldon: Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.\nLeonard: Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?\nSheldon: I will yield.\n\nLeonard: After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?\nSheldon: He does.\nLeonard: I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?\nPenny: Good afternoon, and welcome to today\u2019s physics bowl practice round. I\u2019m Penny, and I\u2019ll be your host, because apparently I didn\u2019t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn\u2019t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?\nLeonard: Yes.\n\nSheldon: Of course.\nHoward: Fire away.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nPenny: You know, it\u2019s none of my business, but isn\u2019t a guy who can\u2019t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?\nLeonard: Oh, uh, he\u2019ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they\u2019re one on one and smell nice.\nPenny: Oh, thanks Raj, it\u2019s vanilla oil.\nLeonard: I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let\u2019s just start.\n\nPenny: Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.\nPenny: That is correct.\nLeonard: I knew that too.\nPenny: Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.\nSheldon: And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.\nPenny: Right.\nHoward: Hey, I buzzed in.\n\nSheldon: But I answered, it\u2019s called teamwork.\nHoward: Don\u2019t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nSheldon: By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I\u2019m a mammal.\nLeonard: Just ask another one.\nPenny: Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging?\nSheldon: And of course it\u2019s Gravity Probe B.\nLeonard: Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.\nSheldon: Why?\nPenny: Because it\u2019s polite.\n\nSheldon: What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?\nPenny: Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.\nSheldon: The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn\u2019t I give them?\nHoward: Some of us might have the correct answers too.\nSheldon: Oh please, you don\u2019t even have a PhD.\nHoward: Alright, that\u2019s it.\nLeonard: Howard, sit down.\nHoward: Okay.\n\nLeonard: maybe we should take a little break.\nSheldon: Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.\near): I agree.\nPenny: What did he say?\n",
      "DATE: November 5, 2007\nHoward: He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer\u2019s eve.\nPenny: Yeah, and the bag it came in.\nSheldon: Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.\nLeonard: Can it wait, I need to talk to you.\n\nSheldon: Just look. I\u2019ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.\nLeonard: Why do they say AA?\nSheldon: Army Ants.\nLeonard: Isn\u2019t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.\nSheldon: Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?\nLeonard: No, I meant\u2026. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!\nSheldon: Oh neat, what\u2019s the occasion?\n\nLeonard: Well, you\u2019re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you\u2019re off the team.\nSheldon: What?\nLeonard: Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.\nSheldon: No you didn\u2019t.\nLeonard: Yes we did, I just came from it.\n"
