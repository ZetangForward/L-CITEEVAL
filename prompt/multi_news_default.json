      "answer": "Buyer beware: Nearly 90% of Apple chargers and cables sold on Amazon could be counterfeit, the AP reports [4]. That's according to a lawsuit Apple filed Monday against Mobile Star LLC [1]. Apple claims the chargers\u2014manufactured by Mobile Star and wrongly bearing the Apple logo\u2014\"pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock\" [5]. According to Mashable, the lawsuit claims the cables and chargers are being sold \"as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images\" [2]. And they're being sold by both third-party sellers and Amazon itself [3]. Apple says customers would have no reason to believe the faulty products are anything but the real deal [2]. And it says that could damage its reputation, 9to5Mac reports [3]. Apple says it routinely buys its own products off Amazon to make sure everything is on the up and up [2]. Apple's lawsuit claims that over the past nine months, nearly 90% of the cables and chargers it purchased were counterfeit [3]. Amazon is cooperating with Apple and has turned over its inventory of cables and chargers [3]. In a statement, Amazon says it \"has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively\" [3][5]. Apple is seeking $2 million per type of counterfeit product from Mobile Star [3].",

        "Buying an Apple charger on Amazon? Watch out.\n\nUp to 90 percent of \"genuine\" Apple chargers sold on Amazon could be counterfeit, Apple has alleged in a new lawsuit against a manufacturer of the products.\n\nApple filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Mobile Star LLC on Monday. The company makes Apple charging products, including Apple chargers and lightning cables that Apple says pose \"a risk to the public.\"\n\nThe counterfeit chargers can catch fire, Apple says in its suit, citing Amazon reviews.\n\n\"Consumers, relying on Amazon.com's reputation, have no reason to suspect the power products they purchased from Amazon.com are anything but genuine,\" the lawsuit says.",
        " \"This is particularly true where, as here, the products are sold directly 'by Amazon.com' as genuine Apple products using Apple's own product marketing images. Consumers are likewise unaware that the counterfeit Apple products that Amazon.com sourced from Mobile Star have not been safety certified or properly constructed, lack adequate insulation and/or have inadequate spacing between low voltage and high voltage circuits, and pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.\"\n\nApple filed its lawsuit after buying the chargers on Amazon, the suit says. Apple said it buys items labeled as Apple products on Amazon each month to check for counterfeit models, and consistently found extreme levels of counterfeits.\n\n\"",
        "Over the last nine months, Apple, as part of its ongoing brand protection efforts, has purchased well over 100 iPhone devices, Apple power products, and Lightning cables sold as genuine by sellers on Amazon.com and delivered through Amazon's 'Fulfillment by Amazon' program,\" the lawsuit says. \"Apple's internal examination and testing for these products revealed almost 90 percent of these products are counterfeit.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Amazon turned over its inventory of the products to Apple after hearing Apple's findings.\n\nEven though Apple is suing the manufacturer here, Amazon still had a role. The products were sold directly by Amazon, not only by third-party sellers.\n\nIn a statement to 9to5Mac,",
        " Amazon said it \"has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits on our site. We work closely with manufacturers and brands, and pursue wrongdoers aggressively.\" ",

(Associated Press)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Apple says it has been buying Apple chargers and cables labeled as genuine on Amazon.com and has found nearly 90 percent of them to be counterfeit.\n\nThe revelation comes in a federal lawsuit filed by Apple against a New Jersey company on Monday over what Apple says are counterfeit products that were sold on Amazon.\n\nIn the lawsuit,",
        " Apple says Mobile Star imprinted Apple logos on cables and chargers that \"pose a significant risk of overheating, fire, and electrical shock.\" It says the chargers and cables were being sold on Amazon as genuine Apple products.\n\nApple says it purchased the products on Amazon and later told the online retailer that they were fake. Amazon then identified Mobile Star as the source.\n\nAmazon isn't named in the suit, but said in a statement that it has \"zero tolerance\" for counterfeiters on its site and that it pursues \"wrongdoers\" aggressively. Mobile Star didn't return a voicemail seeking comment.\n"
