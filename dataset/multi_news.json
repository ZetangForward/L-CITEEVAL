    "answer": "\u2013 Harvey has made landfall again, this time as a tropical storm near the Louisiana-Texas border on the day after the 12th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. ABC News reports the storm came ashore just west of Cameron, La., around 5am ET, with CNN noting that winds of roughly 40mph and a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet are expected. NOAA's public advisory now predicts another 3 to 6 inches of rain in southwestern Louisiana, the eastern Texas border area, and western Kentucky through Friday, with some areas getting as many as 10 inches. But as one National Hurricane Center meteorologist puts it, it's not the end, but the \"end of the beginning\": Per NOAA, \"While the threat of heavy rains has ended in the Houston/Galveston area, catastrophic and life-threatening flooding will continue in and around Houston eastward into southwest Louisiana for the rest of the week.\" More: The AP describes things as \"dire\" in Port Arthur, Texas, near the Louisiana border, on Wednesday morning, as rising floodwaters inundated homes. Port Arthur Mayor Derrick Freeman said on his Facebook page that the \"city is underwater right now but we are coming!\" The AP also suggests some potential relief, at least from the rain, for Houston, with expected rainfall for Wednesday at less than an inch. People reports on one of Harvey's victims: a 41-year-old mother from Beaumont, Texas, who police say \"absolutely\" saved the life of her 3-year-old daughter; the child was found floating in a canal with her mother after the two became stuck while driving. \"The baby also had a backpack that was helping her float on her back and she was holding on to her mom,\" says an officer. Add this to Harvey's toll: two ExxonMobil refineries, which sustained storm-related damage that facilitated the release of pollutants. The Washington Post has the details on the damage at the Baytown oil refinery, America's second-biggest, and the Beaumont petrochemical refinery. NPR explains that the cleanup bill for Harvey could be as much as $100 billion, and while Congress will likely approve the funding needed, \"it probably won't be easy.\" It explains why, and the waves in which the funding would be issued. The New York Times reports that a 12am to 5am curfew is now in place in Houston, and came partly in response to reports of \"small-scale looting.\" The Times puts the death toll at no less than 30. A longtime Houston cop is among the dead.\n",

      "Why Approving Emergency Funding For Harvey Might Not Be Easy For Congress\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen the floodwaters in Texas eventually recede, the cleanup and rebuilding will begin.\n\nThe cleanup bill will likely be hefty \u2014 possibly topping $100 billion \u2014 and the vast majority of those efforts will be funded by the federal government.\n\nPresident Trump doesn't seem worried about Congress footing the bill. \"You're going to see very rapid action from Congress,\" he told reporters Monday. \"You're going to get your funding.\"\n\nIn a visit to Austin on Tuesday, Trump met with the state's two Republican senators and again alluded to the price tag for federal help.\n\n\"We'll be working with these characters over there and think we'll come through with a really,",
      " you know the right solution,\" the president said, adding recovery from Harvey is \"going to be a costly proposition.\"\n\nBut emergency response legislation has become increasingly partisan in recent years, and Congress is already facing a daunting stretch of must-pass bills when it returns next week.\n\nFunding for cleanup and rebuilding will likely pass \u2014 but it probably won't be easy.\n\n\"I sort of see it as everyone holding their breath,\" Sarah Binder, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution, said about the coming stretch of deadlines.\n\nFunding for the government expires Sept. 30. The deadline for raising the debt ceiling hits next month, too. It has been increasingly hard to round up conservative support for both measures in recent years.",
      " \"It's not yet clear how exactly they're going to proceed,\" Binder said. \"And there's the wild card of the president who has threatened to shut down the government if they don't fund a border wall.\"\n\nSeveral popular government programs expire at the end of September, too, and need reauthorization votes beforehand.\n\nThat is the backdrop that urgent Harvey funding will be added to.\n\n\"The federal funds are absolutely essential to recovery,\" says Edward Richards, director of Louisiana State University's Climate Change Law and Policy Project.\n\nOver the past six decades, the federal government has become the prime funder and driver of recovery efforts after major storms.\n\nOn Tuesday night,",
      " Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao announced that her department would make $25 million \"immediately available to help Texas with repairs on flood-damaged roads and bridges,\" following a request by the state. A statement from the secretary said the funding \"represents the beginning of our commitment to help repair Texas' affected infrastructure.\"\n\nRichards describes federal funding as coming in three waves: first, initial grants doled out to individuals and businesses by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAfter that, the National Flood Insurance Program issues billions in claims for flooded-out homes and businesses. \"That is fairly swift and fairly certain money. It's the most reliable relief after a flood,\" Richards says.\n\nExcept for this:",
      " The National Flood Insurance Program happens to be one of those federal programs that expires on Sept. 30.\n\nA spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., insists that won't be a problem. \"Details are still being worked through, but the flood insurance program will be reauthorized,\" said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong in a statement.\n\nBut the program has its share of critics and is still in debt because of major claims payments from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n\nThe third wave of federal funding is even more politically precarious: It's the individual relief bills Congress passes after major disasters.\n\nAfter Superstorm Sandy in 2012, 179 House Republicans voted against relief for the New York-New Jersey area,",
      " including several members of the Texas delegation.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz did as well, in one of his first votes after joining the Senate. Cruz has found himself defending that vote all week. \"The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork,\" he said on MSNBC. \"Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy.\n\nFact-checkers disagree \u2014 and many lawmakers still remember that vote. \"Ted Cruz was one of the leaders who was trying to keep New York and New Jersey and Long Island from getting the funding we needed, and now he's the first one in asking for aid to Texas,\" New York Rep.",
      " Peter King, a fellow Republican, told Long Island's News 12. \"But as bad as I feel toward Ted Cruz \u2014 what a hypocrite he is \u2014 I'm not going to take that out on Texas.\"\n\nAnother quote being resuscitated this week: a 2005 floor speech delivered by then-Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., warning against funding Katrina relief without cutting funding elsewhere. \"Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of nature does not become a catastrophe of debt,\" Pence said at the time.\n\nBinder says both Cruz and Pence are good examples of a longtime legislative adage: \"Where you stand depends on where you sit.\" In other words,",
      " changing circumstances can lead to changing opinions.\n\nTo wit, the recent caveat-free promise Pence made to Houston station KTRH: \"I think what you're going to see is the national government \u2014 and we anticipate the Congress \u2014 are going to make the resources available to see Texas through the rescue operation, through the recovery.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says Democrats are ready and willing to vote for a relief bill. And House Appropriations Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., said in a statement that \"my committee stands at the ready to provide any necessary additional funding for relief and recovery.\"\n\nSo, the measure will likely pass.",
      " The big questions are how much it will ultimately cost and how much it affects all of Congress' other must-pass bills. ",
      " Thousands of people likely remain stranded, and an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 homes have been destroyed in the Houston area as Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical depression, continues to batter the Gulf Coast with torrential rains, flooding and strong winds, Harris County Judge Ed Emmett said.\n\nInterested in Hurricane Harvey?

      " As of 11 p.m. EDT, the slow-moving storm had picked up some speed, moving northeast at 9 mph, with its center was about 30 miles northeast of Alexandria, Louisiana.\n\nThe storm was starting to fall apart overnight, with rain scattered in nature and falling over Mississippi and Arkansas. Residents in western Tennessee, around Memphis, should expect heavy rains on Thursday morning and possible flash flooding as up to 8 inches of rain are possible locally.\n\nBefore that, it battered the Beaumont-Port Arthur area in southeastern Texas, dumping more than 2 feet of rain in some parts. By Wednesday evening, the storm had weakened from a tropical storm to a tropical depression.\n\n\"We have people who are on the second floor of their homes.",
      " They're riding it out, and they're waiting for the waters to go down,\" Emmett, who is also the director of Texas' Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said in an interview Wednesday with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"We've got probably [30,000] to 40,000 homes that have been destroyed,\" Emmett added.\n\nPower outages in the Houston area are down to 75,000, but 32,000 of those outages are inaccessible to crews, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe brunt of the storm's impact has begun to shift to western and northern Louisiana.",
      " Now, for Harris County, \"the biggest challenge is going to get people back in their homes,\" Emmett said. \"We've got to get those people back into their normal lives as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe Houston Airport System announced that it has lifted restrictions on commercial operations. On Saturday, Southwest Airlines will ramp up the number of flights, according to the airport system.\n\nA curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. will take effect in Houston for the second night in a row, Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a press conference. No arrests were made during Tuesday night's curfew, a spokesperson for the Houston Police Department said at the press conference.\n\nThe Houston Fire Department has received about 15,",

The fire department will begin recovery operations in certain areas and conduct door-to-door checks of accessible homes that got more than 3 feet of water, the spokesperson said.\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo said 911 calls for water rescues were down to about 40 an hour as of this morning. Still, the Coast Guard is taking more than 1,000 calls per hour from people needing rescue.\n\nThe Navy is sending two ships -- the USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill -- to the Gulf of Mexico to held with storm relief efforts, it announced Wednesday.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that he will travel to Texas Thursday.",

The storm led to at least 31 deaths over the past five days, according to The Associated Press. Harris County officials, where Houston is located, confirmed six new deaths late Wednesday.\n\nTexas Gov.

Authorities found a third rescuer clinging to a tree, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe Harris County Sheriff's Office urged people awaiting rescue to \"hang a towel or sheet prominently\"",
      " for rescuers to see because addresses are difficult to spot.\n\nHarvey is expected to weaken and continue moving to the north and east across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley through Thursday. But the National Weather Service said Harvey still has the potential to cause \"life-threatening flooding.\"\n\n\"Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding continues in southeastern Texas and portions of southwestern Louisiana,\" the service said in an advisory this morning. \"Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses, as well as other drainage areas and low-lying spots.\"\n\nThe situation became serious in eastern Texas Wednesday.",
      " The National Weather Service issued a flash-flood warning for parts of southeastern Texas, including the cities of Beaumont and Port Arthur, which received more than 26 inches of rain in some areas on Tuesday alone.\n\nPort Arthur Mayor Derrick Freeman urged residents to get to higher ground in a Facebook post early Wednesday.\n\n\"Our whole city is underwater right now but we are coming!\" Freeman wrote in one post. \"Please get to higher ground if you can, but please try stay out of attics.\"\n\nThe largest oil refinery in the United States is shutting down because of the devastating floods.

One witness, who was forced to relocate, said some areas of the center had almost 4 feet of water inside.\n\nDisplaced residents were taken to a secondary evacuation site at the Carl Parker Center, according to ABC Texas affiliate KBMT-TV.\n\nThe disastrous rainfall Wednesday led the National Weather Service to further extend a flash-flood emergency for the cities of Beaumont and Port Arthur until 4:30 p.m. CT in anticipation of additional rain that morning.\n\nThe worst is not over for Texas,",
      " Abbott warned Wednesday. He said 24,000 National Guard troops, including all of Texas' force, have been deployed in the state and will be crucial in the weeks and months to come to help restore order.\n\nThe National Guard has made 8,500 rescues, evacuated 26,000 people and done 1,400 shelter-in-place welfare checks in Texas so far. Meanwhile, there are 32,000 people in shelters throughout the state, Abbott said.\n\nFive days after Harvey first made landfall, FEMA said it's still in \"life-saving, life-sustaining\" mode, with recovering survivors being the top priority.",
      " FEMA Administrator Brock Long said at a news conference Wednesday that there are more than 12,000 emergency staffers on the ground in Texas and Louisiana, spread across 50 counties. The agency is operating more than 230 shelters in Texas, housing more than 30,000 people.\n\nThe George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston is no longer accepting evacuees, Turner said. About 8,000 people are currently at the convention center, down from 10,000 people on Tuesday night.

      " HOUSTON \u2014 Five days after the pummeling began \u2014 a time when big storms have usually blown through, the sun has come out, and evacuees have returned home \u2014 Tropical Storm Harvey refused to go away, battering southeast Texas even more on Tuesday, spreading the destruction into Louisiana and shattering records for rainfall and flooding.\n\nAlong 300 miles of Gulf Coast, people poured into shelters by the thousands, straining their capacity; as heavy rain kept falling, some rivers were still rising and floodwater in some areas had not crested yet; and with whole neighborhoods flooded, others were covered in water for the first time.\n\nOfficials cautioned that the full-fledged rescue-and-",
      "escape phase of the crisis, usually finished by now, would continue, and that they still had no way to gauge the scale of the catastrophe \u2014 how many dead, how many survivors taking shelter inland or still hunkered down in flooded communities, and how many homes destroyed.\n\nFor everybody, it was another head-shaking 24 hours:\n\n\u2022 The storm made its second landfall early Wednesday morning in Louisiana, just west of the town of Cameron, the National Hurricane Center announced at 4 a.m. As Harvey moves northeast through the state scarred by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, forecasters expect it to gradually weaken and become a tropical depression by Wednesday night.\n\n\u2022 Local officials in Texas said at least 30 deaths were believed to have been caused by the storm through Tuesday,",
      " up from eight a day earlier. The dead included a Houston police officer, Sgt.

The previous record was 48 inches in Medina, Tex., from Tropical Storm Amelia in 1978, and with the rain still falling along the Gulf Coast, Harvey could top the 52 inches recorded in Kauai, Hawaii in 1950 from Hurricane Hiki.\n\n\u2022 Houston officials had at first limited the city\u2019s main shelter,",

      " 17,000 people began their day Tuesday in shelters, and the numbers were rising there and in inland cities that had taken evacuees such as Dallas, San Antonio and Austin. Mr. Turner said Houston would create new shelters, Dallas opened its convention center on Tuesday as a shelter for 5,000 people, and Fort Worth said it would open shelters, as well.\n\nIn the Kingwood neighborhood of Houston, people waved towels from apartment windows and yelled \u201cwe\u2019re here\u201d and \u201cfamily of three needs help,\u201d hoping to draw one of the volunteers piloting fishing boats, inflatable rafts and kayaks.

However, it was not immediately clear what caused the smell.\n\nExxonMobil said in the filings that a floating roof covering a tank at the company\u2019s Baytown oil refinery sank in heavy rains, dipping below the surface of oil or other material stored there and causing unusually high emissions,",

No impact to the community has been reported,\u201d the company said in its filing. \u201cActions were taken to minimize emissions and to restore the refinery to normal operations.\u201d\n\nA variety of other chemicals was emitted during the shutdown of the plants. Amy Graham, a spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency, said that ExxonMobil had filed a report at the National Response Center operated by the U.S. Coast Guard saying the Baytown refinery would release about 15 pounds of benzene into the air.\n\n\u201cMost of the unauthorized emissions come from the process of shutting down,",

ExxonMobil said it had flared hazardous materials at its Baytown refinery Sunday and Monday.\n\nMost of the other facilities belonging to major companies also filed notices with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Chevron Phillips, for example, said that it expected its Cedar Bayou chemical plant to exceed permitted limits for several hazardous pollutants, such as 1,",

And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement Ted made.\" After Cruz slammed \"New York values\" and said, \"Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.\" Jeb Bush: \"If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that.\" Referring to Hillary Clinton. Chris Christie: \"You already had your chance, Marco, you blew it.\" (After Rubio talked of other things when asked about entitlements.) Rubio responded, \"I'll answer the entitlement question if you'll answer the Common Core question.\" Christie also said, \u201cI watched story time with Barack Obama [at the State of the Union], and I got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing.\u201d Marco Rubio: He said any \"radical jihadist terrorists\" captured alive would get \"a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.\" Ben Carson: \"If my mother were secretary of the Treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation.\" John Kasich: \"So look, in foreign policy\u2014in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool.

Senator Cruz, what do you see that he doesn't?\n\nCRUZ: Well, Maria, thank you for that question, and let me say thank you to the state of South Carolina for welcoming us.\n\nLet me start -- I want to get to the substance of the question on jobs, but I want to start with something. Today, many of us picked up our newspapers,",

President Obama's preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khamenei. And I'll tell you, it was heartbreaking.\n\nBut the good news is the next commander-in-chief is standing on this stage.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: And I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees,",
      " and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, on to your substantive question. The president tried to paint a rosy picture of jobs. And you know, he's right. If you're a Washington lobbyist, if you make your money in and around Washington, things are doing great. The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama. But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country.\n\nThe reason all of us are here is we believe we should be fighting for the working men and women of this country,",
      " and not Washington, D.C.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Governor Kasich, we are not even two weeks into this stock trading year, but (inaudible) investors already lost $1.6 trillion in market value. That makes it the worst start to a new year ever. Many worry that things will get even worse, and that banks and financial stocks are particularly vulnerable.\n\nNow, if this escalates, like it did back when Barack Obama first assumed the presidency, what actions would you take if this same thing happens all over again just as, in this example,",
      " you are taking over the presidency?\n\nKASICH: Look, it takes three things basically to grow jobs. And I've done it when I was in Washington when we had a balanced budget; had four years of balanced budgets; paid down a half-trillion of debt. And our economy was growing like crazy. It's the same thing that I did in Ohio. It's a simple formula: common sense regulations, which is why I think we should freeze all federal regulations for one year, except for health and safety. It requires tax cuts, because that sends a message to the job creators that things are headed the right way. And if you tax cuts -- if you cut taxes for corporations,",
      " and you cut taxes for individuals, you're going to make things move, particularly the corporate tax, which is the highest, of course, in the -- in the world.\n\nBut in addition to that, we have to have fiscal discipline. We have to show that we can march to a balanced budget. And when you do that, when you're in a position of managing regulations; when you reduce taxes; and when you have fiscal discipline, you see the job creators begin to get very comfortable with the fact that they can invest.\n\nRight now, you don't have the -- you have taxes that are too high. You have regulations -- I mean,",
      " come on, they're affecting everybody here, particularly our small businesses. They are -- they're in a position where they're smothering people. And I mean, are you kidding me? We're nowhere close to a balanced budget or fiscal discipline.\n\nThose three things put together are going to give confidence to job creators and you will begin to see wages rise. You will begin to see jobs created in a robust economy. And how do I know it? Because I've done it. I did it as the chairman of the Budget Committee, working with Senator Domenici. And I've done it in the state of Ohio as the chief executive.\n\nOur wages are growing faster than the national average.",
      " We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO: We know that recent global events have many people worried -- Iran detaining American sailors, forcing them to apologize; North Korea and its nuclear ambitions; an aggressive China; and a Middle East that continues to deteriorate, not to mention ISIS is getting stronger.\n\nGovernor Christie, sometimes it seems the world is on fire. Where and when should a president use military action to restore order?\n\nCHRISTIE: Well, Maria, I'm glad to have heard from you in the summary of that question about what's going on in the world.",
      " Because Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama. And I've got to tell you, it sounded like everything in the world was going amazing, you know?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThe fact is, there's a number of things that the next president is going to have to do to clean up this mess. The first thing is we have to strengthen our alliances around the world. And the best way to do that is to start talking to our allies again and having them be able to count on our word.\n\nCHRISTIE: Lots of people will say lots of different things about me in this campaign and others, but the one thing they've never said about me is that I'm misunderstood.",
      " And so when we talk to our allies and we give them our word, in a Christie administration, they know we're going to keep it.\n\nNext, we have to talk to our adversaries, and we have to make sure they understand the limits of our patience. And this president, given what Ted said right at the beginning, he's absolutely right. It's a -- it's absolutely disgraceful that Secretary Kerry and others said in their response to what's going on in Iran that this was a good thing; it showed how the relationship was getting better.\n\nThe president doesn't understand -- and by the way, neither does Secretary Clinton -- and here's my warning to everybody out in the audience tonight.",
      " If you're worried about the world being on fire, you're worried about how we're going to use our military, you're worried about strengthening our military and you're worried most of all about keeping your homes and your families safe and secure, you cannot give Hillary Clinton a third term of Barack Obama's leadership.\n\nI will not do that. If I'm the nominee, she won't get within 10 miles of the White House.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO: Just to be clear Governor, where and when would you use military action?\n\nCHRISTIE: Military action, Maria, would be used when it was absolutely necessary to protect American lives and protect American interests around the world.",
      " We are not the world's policeman, but we need to stand up and be ready.\n\nAnd the problem, Maria, is that the military is not ready, either. We need to rebuild our military, and this president has let it diminish to a point where tinpot dictators like the mullahs in Iran are taking our Navy ships. It is disgraceful, and in a Christie administration, they would know much, much better than to do that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Governor Bush, the president just told the nation two nights ago that America is back and that the idea that our enemies are getting stronger or that this country is getting weaker,",
      " well, it's just rhetoric and hot air. Now other Democrats go even further, sir, saying Republicans even suggesting such comments actually embolden our enemies. I guess they would include you. What do you say?\n\nBUSH: Well first of all, the idea that somehow we're better off today than the day that Barack Obama was inaugurated president of the United States is totally an alternative universe. The simple fact is that the world has been torn asunder.\n\nThink about it. With grandiose language, the president talks about red lines and nothing to follow it up; talks about ISIS being the JV team, they form a caliphate the size of Indiana with 35 (thousand)",
      " to 40,000 battle-tested terrorists. He's missing the whole point, that America's leadership in the world is required for peace and stability.\n\nIn the crowd today is Major General James Livingston, who's the co-chairman of my campaign here in South Carolina, a Medal of Honor recipient.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI've learned from him that what we need to achieve is peace through strength, which means we need to rebuild the military. In this administration, every weapon system has been gutted, in this administration, the force levels are going down to a level where we can't even project force. Our friends no longer think we have their back and our enemies no longer fear us,",
      " and we're in a much difficult -- we're in a much different position than we should be.\n\nAnd for the life of me, I have no understanding why the president thinks that everything is going well. Terrorism is on the run, China, Russia is advancing their agenda at warp speed, and we pull back.\n\nAs president of the United States, I will be a commander in chief that will have the back of the military. We will rebuild the military to make sure that it is a solid force, not to be the world's policeman, but to make sure that in a peaceful world, people know that the United States is there to take care of our own national interests and take care of our allies.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO:",
      " So I take it from that you do not agree with the president.\n\nBUSH: No. And worse -- worse yet, to be honest with you, Hillary Clinton would be a national security disaster.\n\nThink about it. She wants to continue down the path of Iran, Benghazi, the Russian reset, Dodd-Frank, all the things that have -- that have gone wrong in this country, she would be a national security mess. And that is wrong.\n\nAnd you know what? Here's the problem. If she gets elected, she's under investigation with the FBI right now. If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda,",
      " she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that. (LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Senator Rubio, the president says that ISIS doesn't threaten our national existence like a Germany or a Japan back in World War II, that the terror group is nothing more than twisted souls plotting attacks in their garages.\n\nBut House Homeland Security Committee recently said that over 1,000 ongoing investigations of homegrown extremism in 50 states. So how do you define the threat? Germany then or dangerous nut cases now?\n\nRUBIO: Yeah, I would go, first of all,",
      " one step further in this description of Hillary Clinton. She wouldn't just be a disaster, Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being commander in chief of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSomeone who cannot handle intelligence information appropriately cannot be commander in chief and someone who lies to the families of those four victims in Benghazi can never be president of the United States. Ever.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOn the issue of Barack Obama, Barack Obama does not believe that America is a great global power. Barack Obama believes that America is a arrogant global power that needs to be cut down to size. And that's how you get a foreign policy where we cut deals with our enemies like Iran and we betray our allies like Israel and we gut our military and we go around the world like he has done on 10 separate occasions and apologized for America.\n\nHe doesn't understand the threat in ISIS.",
      " He consistently underestimates it but I do not. There is a war against ISIS, not just against ISIS but against radical jihadists terrorists, and it is a war that they win or we win.\n\nWhen I'm president of the United States, we are going to win this war on ISIS. The most powerful intelligence agency in the world is going to tell us where we are, the most powerful military in the world is going to destroy them. And if we capture any of them alive, they are getting a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we are going to find out everything they know.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO:",
      " Thank you, Senator.\n\nBARTIROMO: Dr. Carson, the president says he does not want to treat ISIS as a foreign army, but ISIS is neither a country nor a government. How do you attack a network that does not respect national borders?\n\nCARSON: Well, I'm very happy to get a question this early on. I was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, I find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations. The fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century,",
      " and that war is very different than it used to be before. Not armies massively marching on each other and air forces, but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid. And, you know, we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously. And we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid.\n\nI mean, just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs.",
      " Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.\n\nBut here's the real key. We have the world's best military, even though he's done everything he can to diminish it. And the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back, they can get it accomplished.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Mr. Trump, at the State of the Union, the president pointed to a guest who was a Syrian refugee you might recall whose wife and daughter and other family members were killed in an air attack.",
      " Now he fled that country seeking asylum here, ultimately ended up in Detroit where he's now trying to start a new life.\n\nThe president says that that doctor is the real face of these refugees and not the one that you and some of your colleagues on this stage are painting; that you prefer the face of fear and terror and that you would refuse to let in anyone into this country seeking legitimate asylum. How do you answer that?\n\nTRUMP: It's not fear and terror, it's reality. You just have to look today at Indonesia, bombings all over.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou look at California, you look, frankly, at Paris where there's a -- the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world,",
      " and you see what happens: 130 people dead with many to follow. They're very, very badly wounded. They will -- some will follow. And you look around, and you see what's happening, and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor -- very nice, everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration.\n\nThat could be the great Trojan Horse. It could be people that are going to do great, great destruction. When I look at the migration, I looked at the line, I said it actually on your show recently, where are the women? It looked like very few women.",
      " Very few children. Strong, powerful men, young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on?\n\nTRUMP: You look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married, they were radicalized -- they got married, they killed 15 people in actually 15 -- going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look -- a good strong look and that's what we have. We are nineteen trillion dollars -- our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders. We can't do it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO:",
      " Senator Cruz, the New York Times is reporting that you failed to properly disclose a million dollars in loans from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank. During your senate race, your campaign said, \"it was inadvertent.\" A million dollars is inadvertent?\n\nCRUZ: Well Maria, thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the New York Times. You know the nice thing about the mainstream media, they don't hide their views. The New York Times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying, \"Anybody But Cruz.\" Had that actually -- that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move,",

Now in terms of their really stunning hit piece, what they mentioned is when I was running for senate -- unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't have masses of money in the bank, hundreds of millions of dollars. When I was running for senate just about every lobbyist, just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in Texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars. He put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife Heidi and I,",
      " we ended up investing everything we owned.\n\nWe took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks. And the entire New York times attack -- is that I disclosed that loan on one filing with the United States Senate, that was a public filing. But it was not on a second filing with FDIC and yes, I made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other. But if that's the best the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCAVUTO: All right.",
      " Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate, right here in North Charleston, South Carolina. Let's get right back to the questions. And I'll start with you, Senator Cruz.\n\nNow you are, of course, a strict constitutionalist -- no one would doubt that. And as you know, the U.S. Constitution says only natural-born citizens are eligible for the office of president of the United States. Stop me if you've heard this before. Now, you were born...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... you were born in Canada to an American mother. So you were and are considered an American citizen. But that fellow next to you,",

There was nothing to this birther issue.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNow, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut the poll numbers have.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I recognize -- I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.",
      " But the facts and the law here are really quite clear. Under longstanding U.S. law, the child of a U.S. citizen born abroad is a natural-born citizen.\n\nIf a soldier has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why John McCain, even though he was born in Panama, was eligible to run for president.\n\nIf an American missionary has a child abroad, that child is a natural-born citizen. That's why George Romney, Mitt's dad, was eligible to run for president, even though he was born in Mexico.\n\nAt the end of the day, the legal issue is quite straightforward, but I would note that the birther theories that Donald has been relying on -- some of the more extreme ones insist that you must not only be born on U.S.",

      " some of the stuff, you have to also own then. So let's set the facts straight. First of all, I didn't support Sonia Sotomayor. Secondly, I never wrote a check to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThird, if you look at my record as governor of New Jersey, I have vetoed a 50-caliber rifle ban. I have vetoed a reduction this clip size. I vetoed a statewide I.D. system for gun owners and I pardoned, six out-of-state folks who came through our state and were arrested for owning a gun legally in another state so they never have to face charges.\n\nAnd on Common Core,",
      " Common Core has been eliminated in New Jersey. So listen, this is the difference between being a governor and a senator. See when you're a senator, what you get to do is just talk and talk and talk.

And the people of New Jersey, I've seen it.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCHRISTIE: And the last piece is this. I like Marco too, and two years ago, he called me a conservative reformer that New Jersey needed.",
      " That was before he was running against me. Now that he is, he's changed his tune.\n\nI'm never going to change my tune. I like Marco Rubio.

Neil, my name was mentioned as well.\n\nHere's the deal, Chris is totally right. He's been a good governor, and he's a heck of a lot better than his predecessor that would have bankrupted New Jersey.\n\nEverybody on this stage is better than Hillary Clinton.",

Everybody's record's going to be scrutinized, and at the end of the day we need to unite behind the winner so we can defeat Hillary Clinton, because she is a disaster.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOur country rise up again, but we need to have a compelling conservative agenda that we present to the American people in a way that doesn't disparage people,",
      " that unites us around our common purpose.\n\nAnd so everybody needs to discount some of the things you're going to hear in these ads, and discount the -- the back-and-forth here, because every person here is better than Hillary Clinton.\n\nCARSON: Neil, I was mentioned too.\n\nCAVUTO: You were?\n\nCARSON: Yeah, he said everybody.

      " very difficult for them.\n\nPart of the reason why it hasn't risen because sometimes we're not giving people the skills they need. Sometimes it's because the Federal Reserve kept interest rates so low that the wealthy were able to invest in -- in strong assets like the stock market when everybody else was left behind.\n\nPeople are upset about it. I'll tell you what else they're upset about: you're 50 or 51 years old, and some kid walks in and tells you you're out of work, and you don't know where to go and where to turn. Do we have answer for that? We do. There are ways to retrain the 50 and 51-year-olds,",

      " Welcome back to the Republican presidential debates, right here in North Charleston. Let's get right back to the questions.\n\nGovernor Bush, gun rights, one of the top issues seen on Facebook with close to 3 million people talking about it in the past month. Right here in Charleston, Dylann Roof, who has been accused of killing nine people in a nearby church, reportedly had not passed his background check when he got his gun. What is the harm in tightening standards for not only who buys guns, but those who sell them?\n\nBUSH: First of all, I'd like to recognize Governor Haley for her incredible leadership in the aftermath of the --\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH:",
      " The Emanuel AME church killings. And I also want to recognize the people in that church that showed the grace of God and the grace of forgiveness and the mercy that they showed.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: I don't know if any of us could have done what they did, one after another, within 48 hours of that tragedy taking place. Look, here's the deal, in this particular case, the FBI made a mistake. The law itself requires a background check, but that didn't fulfill their part of the bargain within the time that they were supposed to do.\n\nWe don't need to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does its job.",
      " Because that person should not have gotten a gun, should not -- would not have passed a background check. The first impulse of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is to take rights away from law- abiding citizens.\n\nThat's what they do, whether it's the San Bernardino attack or if it's these tragedies that take place, I think we need to focus on what the bigger issue is. It isn't law-abiding gun owners.\n\nLook, I have an A plus rating in the NRA and we also have a reduction in gun violence because in Florida, if you commit a crime with a gun, you're going away. You're going away for a long,",
      " long while.\n\nAnd that's what we should focus on is the violence in our communities. Target the efforts for people that are committing crimes with guns, and if you do that, and get it right, you're going to be much better off than creating a political argument where there's a big divide.\n\nThe other issue is mental health. That's a serious issue that we could work on. Republicans and Democrats alike believe this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: The president's first impulse is do this by executive order, power he doesn't have. Why not go to Congress and in a bipartisan way, begin to deal with the process of mental health issues so that people that are spiraling out of control because of mental health challenges don't have access to guns.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO:",
      " Thank you, sir.\n\nMr. Trump, are there any circumstances that you think we should be limiting gun sales of any kind in America?\n\nTRUMP: No. I am a 2nd amendment person. If we had guns in California on the other side where the bullets went in the different direction, you wouldn't have 14 or 15 people dead right now.\n\nIf even in Paris, if they had guns on the other side, going in the opposite direction, you wouldn't have 130 people plus dead. So the answer is no and what Jeb said is absolutely correct.\n\nWe have a huge mental health problem in this country.",

He doesn't want to get people together, the old-fashioned way, where you get Congress. You get the Congress, you get the Senate, you get together,",

      " That doesn't sound like a White House unfriendly to gun owners.\n\nRUBIO: That sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nLook, the Second Amendment is not an option. It is not a suggestion. It is a constitutional right of every American to be able to protect themselves and their families. I am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in America, he would. I am convinced that this president, if he could get rid of the Second Amendment, he would. I am convinced because I see how he works with his attorney general, not to defend the Second Amendment,",
      " but to figure out ways to undermine it.\n\nI have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the Second Amendment, but to figure out ways to undermine it.\n\nHere's my second problem. None of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive. You know why? Because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show. They don't buy their guns from a collector. And they don't buy their guns from a gun store. They get -- they steal them. They get them on the black market.\n\nAnd let me tell you, ISIS and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show.",
      " These...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... his answer -- you name it. If there's an act of violence in America, his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control. Here's a fact. We are in a war against ISIS. They are trying to attack us here in America. They attacked us in Philadelphia last week. They attacked us in San Bernardino two weeks ago. And the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun.\n\nWhen I'm president of the United States, we are defending the Second Amendment, not undermining it the way Barack Obama does.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO:",
      " But what fact can you point to, Senator -- what fact can you point to that the president would take away everyone's gun? You don't think that's (inaudible)?\n\nRUBIO: About every two weeks, he holds a press conference talking about how he can't wait to restrict people's access to guns. He has never defended...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRUBIO: I'll give you a fact. Well, let me tell you this. Do you remember when he ran for president of the United States, and he was a candidate, and he went and said, \"These Americans with traditional values, they are bitter people,",
      " and they cling to their guns and to their religion.\" That tells you right away where he was headed on all of this.\n\nThis president every chance he has ever gotten has tried to undermine the Second Amendment.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHe doesn't meet -- here's the difference. When he meets with the attorney general in the White House, it's not \"how can we protect the Second Amendment rights of Americans.\" It's \"give me options on how I can make it harder for law-abiding people to buy guns.\" That will never happen when I am president of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Governor Christie, you,",
      " too, have criticized the president's recent executive action on gun control, saying it's unconstitutional, another step to bypass Congress. But hasn't your own position on guns evolved, sir? The New Jersey Star-Ledger reports that you signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms, and that you argued back in August 2013, and I quote, \"These common sense measures will strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws.\"\n\nSo isn't that kind of what the president wants to do now?\n\nCHRISTIE: No, absolutely not. The president wants to do things without working with his Congress, without working with the legislature, and without getting the consent of the American people.",
      " And the fact is that that's not a democracy. That's a dictatorship. And we need to very, very concerned about that.\n\nSee, here's the thing. I don't think the founders put the Second Amendment as number two by accident. I don't think they dropped all the amendments into a hat and picked them out of a hat. I think they made the Second Amendment the second amendment because they thought it was just that important.\n\nThe fact is in New Jersey, what we have done is to make it easier now to get a conceal and carry permit. We have made it easier to do that, not harder. And the way we've done it properly through regulatory action,",
      " not buy signing unconstitutional executive orders. This guy is a petulant child. That's what he is. I mean, you know...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... the fact is, Neil, let's think about -- let's think about -- and I want to maybe -- I hope the president is watching tonight, because here's what I'd like to tell him.\n\nMr. President, we're not against you. We're against your policies. When you became president, you had a Democratic Congress and a filibuster-proof Democratic Senate. You had only 21 Republican governors in this country. And now after seven years of your policies, we have the biggest majority we've had since the 1920s in the House;",
      " a Republican majority in the Senate; and 31 out of 50 Republican governors.\n\nThe American people have rejected your agenda and now you're trying to go around it. That's not right. It's not constitutional. And we are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO: So what is the answer, Senator Cruz, to stop mass shootings and violent crime, up in 30 cities across the country?\n\nCRUZ: The answer is simple. Your prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, Neil asked: What has President Obama do -- done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns?\n\nWell,",
      " he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\nHe launched Fast and Furious, illegally selling guns to Mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials. And I'll tell you what Hillary Clinton has said: Hillary Clinton says she agrees with the dissenters -- the Supreme Court dissenters in the Heller case.\n\nThere were four dissenters, and they said that they believe the Second Amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever,",
      " which means, if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one, two, three, maybe four Supreme Court justices, the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the Second Amendment and the government could confiscate your guns.\n\nAnd I'll note that California senator -- Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said, if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America, \"give me your guns, I'm rounding them up,\" she would.\n\nAnd let me make a final point on this. Listen, in any Republican primary, everyone is going to say they support the Second Amendment. Unless you are clinically insane...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... that's what you say in a primary.",
      " But the voters are savvier than that. They recognize that people's actions don't always match their words. I've got a proven record fighting to defend the Second Amendment.\n\nThere's a reason Gun Owners of America has endorsed me in this race. There's a reason the NRA gave me their Carter Knight Freedom Fund award...\n\n(BELL RINGS)... and there's a reason, when Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms, that I led the opposition, along with millions of Americans -- we defeated that gun control legislation.\n\nAnd I would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight.\n\nBARTIROMO:",
      " Senator...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... let me follow up and switch gears.\n\nSenator Cruz, you suggested Mr. Trump, quote, \"embodies New York values.\" Could you explain what you mean by that?\n\nCRUZ: You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBARTIROMO: I am from New York. I don't.\n\nCRUZ: What -- what -- you're from New York? So you might not.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd listen, there are many,",
      " many wonderful, wonderful working men and women in the state of New York. But everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro- gay-marriage, focus around money and the media.\n\nAnd -- and I would note indeed, the reason I said that is I was asked -- my friend Donald has taken to it as (ph) advance playing Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\", and I was asked what I thought of that.\n\nAnd I said, \"well, if he wanted to play a song, maybe he could play, 'New York, New York'?\" And -- and -- you know,",
      " the concept of New York values is not that complicated to figure out.\n\nNot too many years ago, Donald did a long interview with Tim Russert. And in that interview, he explained his views on a whole host of issues that were very, very different from the views he's describing now.\n\nAnd his explanation -- he said, \"look, I'm from New York, that's what we believe in New York. Those aren't Iowa values, but this is what we believe in New York.\" And so that was his explanation.\n\nAnd -- and I guess I can -- can frame it another way. Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.",
      " I'm just saying.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBARTIROMO: Are you sure about that?\n\nCAVUTO: Maria...\n\nTRUMP: So conservatives actually do come out of Manhattan, including William F. Buckley and others, just so you understand.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd just so -- if I could, because he insulted a lot of people. I've had more calls on that statement that Ted made -- New York is a great place. It's got great people, it's got loving people, wonderful people.\n\nWhen the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully,",
      " more humanely than New York. You had two one hundred...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you had two 110-story buildings come crashing down. I saw them come down. Thousands of people killed, and the cleanup started the next day, and it was the most horrific cleanup, probably in the history of doing this, and in construction. I was down there, and I've never seen anything like it.\n\nAnd the people in New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death, and even the smell of death -- nobody understood it. And it was with us for months, the smell, the air.\n\nTRUMP: And we rebuilt downtown Manhattan,",
      " and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers. And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement that Ted made.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Governor bush, for the third time in as many months, the Iranians have provoked us, detaining us, as we've been discussing, with these 10 Navy sailors Tehran had said strayed into their waters. The sailors were released, but only after shown on video apologizing for the incident. This occurring only weeks after Iran fired multiple rockets within 1,500 yards of a U.S. aircraft carrier and then continued to test medium range missiles.\n\nNow you've claimed that such actions indicate Tehran has little to fear from a President Obama.",
      " I wonder, sir, what would change if they continued doing this sort of thing under a President Jeb Bush?\n\nBUSH: Well, first of all, under President Jeb Bush, we would restore the strength of the military. Last week, Secretary Carter announced that the Navy's going to be cut again. It's now half the size of what it was prior to Operation Desert Storm.\n\nThe deployments are too high for the military personnel. We don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment. The B-52 is still operational as the long range bomber; it was inaugurated in the age of Harry Truman. The planes are older than the pilots.",
      " We're gutting our military, and so the Iranians and the Chinese and the Russians and many other countries look at the United States not as serious as we once were.\n\nWe have to eliminate the sequester, rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game.\n\nSecondly, as it relates to Iran, we need to confront their ambitions across the board. We should reimpose sanctions, they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.\n\nThirdly, we need to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with Israel --\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority.\n\nWe need to get back in the game as it relates to our Arab nations.",
      " The rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak. This president and John Kerry and Hillary Clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act, but he must act to confront the ambitions of Iran. We can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Thank you, Governor. Governor Kasich, while everyone has been focusing on Iran's provocations, I'm wondering what you make of what Saudi Arabia has been doing and its recent moves in the region, including its execution of a well-known Shi'ite cleric and its move to dramatically increase oil production,",
      " some say in an effort to drive down oil prices and force a lot of U.S. oil producers out of business.\n\nSure enough, oil prices have tumbled. One brokerage house is predicting a third or more of American oil producers and those heavily invested in fracking will go bankrupt, and soon Saudi Arabia and OPEC will be back in the driver's seat.\n\nU.S. energy player Harold Hamrie similarly told me with friends like these, who needs enemies? Do you agree?\n\nKASICH: Well, let me -- let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience. I served on the Defense Committee for 18 years,",
      " and by the way, one of the members of that committee was Senator Strom Thurmond from South Carolina. Let em also tell you...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... that after the 9/11 attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld invited me to the Pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of Defense. And in that meeting, I suggested we had a problem with technology, and that I wanted to take people from Silicon Valley into the Pentagon to solve our most significant problems. So I not only had the opportunity to go through the Cold War struggles in Central America, and even after 9/11 to be involved.\n\nWith Saudi Arabia and oil production,",
      " first of all, it's so critical for us to be energy independent, and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because, see, energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility, and secondly, if you want to bring jobs back to the United States of America in industry, low prices make the difference.\n\nWe're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country. And that's why we must make sure we continue to frack.\n\nIn terms of Saudi Arabia, look, my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses. That is a bad deal and an evil situation,",
      " and presidents have looked the other way. And I was going to tell you, whether I'm president or not, we better make it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you, we're in relation with you just like we were in the first Gulf War, but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: So look, in foreign policy -- in foreign policy, it's strength, but you've got to be cool. You've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go.",
      " And I'm going to tell you, that it -- I'm going to suggest to you here tonight, that you can't do on the job training.\n\nI've seen so much of it - a Soviet Union, the coming down of a wall, the issues that we saw around the world in Central America, the potential spread of communism, and 9/11 and Gulf War. You see what the Saudi's -- deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us. And they must be part of our coalition to destroy ISIS and I believe we can get that done.\n\nThank you.\n\nCAVUTO:",

Recognize that the caliphate is what gives them the legitimacy to go out on a jihadist mission, so we need to take that away from them.\n\nThe way to take that away from them is to talk to our military officials and ask them,",

In fact, he's done worse than nothing.\n\nThis president -- and,",

Now, the fact is, what this president has done is invited Russia to play an even bigger role, bring in Vladimir Putin to negotiate getting those chemical weapons back from Assad, yet what do we have today?\n\nWe have the Russians and the Iranians working together, not to fight ISIS, but to prop up Assad. The fact of the matter is we're not going to have peace -- we are not going to have peace in Syria. We're not going to be able to rebuild it unless we put a no-fly zone there, make it safe for those folks so we don't have to be talking about Syrian refugees anymore.\n\nThe Syrians should stay in Syria.",

They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to but they taunt us.\n\nThey say, \" well, we don't really have control.\" Without China, North Korea doesn't even eat. China is ripping us on trade. They're devaluing their currency and they're killing our companies. Thousands of thousands -- you look at the number of companies and the number in terms of manufacturing of plans that we've lost -- 50,",
      "000 because of China.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCAVUTO: So they've never said to put a tariff on their... TRUMP: We've lost anywhere between four and seven million jobs because of China. What I said then was, \"we have very unfair trade with China. We're going to have a trade deficit of 505 billion dollars this year with China.\" A lot of that is because they devalue their currency.\n\nWhat I said to the New York Times, is that, \"we have great power, economic power over China and if we wanted to use that and the amount -- where the 45 percent comes in,",
      " that would be the amount they saw their devaluations that we should get.\" That we should get.\n\nWhat I'm saying is this, I'm saying that we do it but if they don't start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so that our companies can compete and we don't lose all of these millions of jobs that we're losing, I would certainly start taxing goods that come in from China. Who the hell has to lose 505 billion dollars a year?\n\nCAVUTO: I'm sorry, you lost me.\n\nTRUMP: It's not that complicated actually.\n\nCAVUTO: Then I apologize.",
      " Then I want to understand, if you don't want a 45 percent tariff, say that wasn't the figure, would you be open -- are you open to slapping a higher tariff on Chinese goods of any sort to go back at them?\n\nTRUMP: OK, just so you understand -- I know so much about trading about with China. Carl Icon today as you know endorsed. Many businessmen want to endorse me.\n\nCAVUTO: I know...\n\nTRUMP: Carl said, \"no, no -- \" but he's somebody -- these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the China people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this.",

They do whatever what they do, OK. When we do business with China, they tax us. You don't know it, they tax us.\n\nI have many friends that deal with China. They can't -- when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed. If you looking at what happened with Boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal -- so we don't have an equal playing field.",

I believe in the PTT because it's important those countries in Asia are interfacing against China.

And I'll allow putting that tariff or whatever he's saying here...\n\nTRUMP: I'm happy to have him tonight...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKASICH: For too long -- no, for too long, what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs, and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us.

      " then what do we tell the worker? Oh, well, you know, it just didn't work out for you.\n\nI think we should be for free trade but I think fair trade. And when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country, we need -- we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy.\n\nAnd I want to just suggest to you. How do I know this? Because so many people in my family worked in steel mills, and they didn't work with a white collar, they worked in a blue collar. And the fact is those jobs are critical, they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're Americans and they carry the load.",

That's what I think we need to do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: All right.\n\nRUBIO: But on this point, if I may add something on this point. We are all frustrated with what China is doing. I think we need to be very careful with tariffs, and here's why.\n\nChina doesn't pay the tariff, the buyer pays the tariff. If you send a tie or a shirt made in China into the United States and an American goes to buy it at the store and there's a tariff on it, it gets passed on in the price to price to the consumer.\n\nSo I think the better approach,",
      " the best thing we can do to protect ourselves against China economically is to make our economy stronger, which means reversing course from all the damage Barack Obama is doing to this economy.\n\nIt begins with tax reform. Let's not have the most expensive business tax rate in the world. Let's allow companies to immediately expense.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt continues with regulatory reform. Regulations in this country are out of control, especially the Employment Prevention Agency, the EPA, and all of the rules they continue to impose on our economy and hurting us.\n\nHow about Obamacare, a certified job killer?

It would just -- you absolutely have to get involved with China, they are taking so much of what we have in terms of jobs in terms of money. We just can't do it any longer.\n\nCAVUTO: He is right.

We've got to get to tax reform, and we've got to get to the...\n\n(UNKNOWN): Yeah, but I want to talk about taxes.\n\nBARTIROMO:... we've got to get to the national debt as well. Coming up next, the growing national debt, the war on crime, tax reform. More from North Charleston,",
      " South Carolina, when we come right back.\n\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate here in North Charleston. Right back to the questions.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGovernor Christie, we have spoken much about cutting spending, given the $19 trillion debt. But according to one report, America needs $3.6 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2020.\n\nHere in South Carolina, 11 percent of bridges are considered structurally deficient, costing drivers a billion dollars a year in auto repairs. What is your plan to fix the ailing roads and bridges without breaking the bank?\n\nCHRISTIE:",
      " Well, I'm glad you asked that, Maria. Here's -- here's our plan. We've all been talking about tax reforms tonight, and paying for infrastructure is caught right up in tax reform.\n\nIf you reform the corporate tax system in this country, which, as was mentioned before, is the highest rate in the world -- and we double tax, as you know.\n\nAnd what that's led to over $2 trillion of American companies' monies that are being kept offshore, because they don't want to pay the second tax. And who can blame them? They pay tax once overseas. They don't want to pay 35 percent tax on the way back.\n\nSo beside reforming that tax code,",
      " bringing it down to 25 percent and eliminating those special-interest loopholes that the lobbyists and the lawyers and the accountants have given -- bring that rate down to 25 percent, but also, a one-time repatriation of that money.\n\nBring the money -- the $2 trillion -- back to the United States. We'll tax it, that one time, at 8.75 percent, because 35 percent of zero is zero, but 8.75 percent of $2 trillion is a lot of money. And I would then dedicate that money to rebuilding infrastructure here in this country.\n\nIt would not necessitate us raising any taxes.",
      " It would bring the money back into the United States to help build jobs by American companies and get our economy moving again, and growing as a higher rate, and it would rebuild those roads and bridges and tunnels that you were talking about. And -- and -- and the last piece of this, Maria, is this. You know, the fact is that this president has penalized corporations in America. He's penalized -- and doesn't understand. In fact, what that hurts is hurt hardworking taxpayers.\n\nYou've seen middle-class wages go backwards $3,700 during the Obama administration. That's wrong for hardworking taxpayers in this country.",
      " We'd rebuild infrastructure that would also create jobs in this country, and we'd work with the states to do it the right way, to do it more efficiently and more effectively.\n\nAnd remember this -- I'm credible on this for this reason: Americans for Tax Reform says that I've vetoed more tax increases than any governor in American history. We don't need to raise taxes to get this done.\n\nWe need to make the government run smarter and better, and reform this corporate tax system, bring that money back to the United States to build jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, and we need to use it also to protect our grid from terrorists.\n\nAll of those things are important,",
      " and all those things would happen in a Christie administration.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir. Dr. Carson...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... it is true U.S. companies have $2 trillion in cash sitting overseas right now. That could be used for investment and jobs in America.\n\nAlso, several companies right now are pursuing mergers to move their corporate headquarters abroad, and take advantage of much lower taxes. What will you do to stop the flow of companies building cash away from America, and those leaving America altogether?\n\nCARSON: Well, I would suggest a fair tax system, and that's what we have proposed. A flat tax for everybody -- no exemptions,",
      " no deductions, no shelters, because some people have a better capability of taking advantage of those than others.\n\nYou know, and then the other thing we have to do is stop spending so much money. You know, I -- my -- my mother taught me this. You know, she only had a third-grade education, but -- you know, she knew how to stretch a dollar.\n\nI mean, she would drive a car until it wouldn't make a sound, and then gather up all her coins and buy a new car. In fact, if my mother were secretary of treasury, we would not be in a deficit situation. But...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n... you know,",
      " the -- the -- the fact of the matter is -- you know, if we fix the taxation system, make it absolutely fair, and get rid of the incredible regulations -- because every regulation is a tax, it's a -- on goods and services. And it's the most regressive tax there is.\n\nYou know, when you go into the store and buy a box of laundry detergent, and the price has up -- you know, 50 cents because of regulations, a poor person notices that. A rich person does not. Middle class may notice it when they get to the cash register.\n\nAnd everything is costing more money, and we are killing our -- our -- our people like this.",
      " And Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will say it's those evil rich people.\n\nIt's not the evil rich people. It's the evil government that is -- that is putting all these regulations on us so that we can't survive.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, sir.\n\nSenator Rubio...\n\nTRUMP: Maria -- Maria, what you were talking about just now is called corporate inversion. It's one of the biggest problems our country has. Right now, corporations, by the thousands, are thinking of leaving our country with the jobs -- leave them behind.\n\nTRUMP: They're leaving because of taxes, but they are also leaving because they can't get their money back and everybody agrees,",
      " Democrats and Republicans, that is should come back in. But they can't get along. They can't even make a deal.\n\nHere is the case, they both agree, they can't make a deal. We have to do something. Corporate inversion is one of the biggest problems we have. So many companies are going to leave our country.\n\nBARTIROMO: Which is why we raised it.\n\nSenator Rubio?\n\nThank you, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you.\n\nBARTIROMO: One of the biggest fiscal challenges is our entitlement programs, particularly Social Security and Medicare. What policies will you put forward to make sure these programs are more financially secure?\n\nRUBIO:",
      " Well, first let me address the tax issue because it's related to the entitlement issue and I want to thank you for holding a substantive debates where we can have debates about these key issues on taxes.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: Here is the one thing I'm not going to do. I'm not going to have something that Ted described in his tax plan. It's called the value added tax. And it's a tax you find in many companies in Europe.\n\nWhere basically, businesses now will have to pay a tax, both on the money they make, but they also have to pay taxes on the money that they pay their employees.\n\nAnd that's why they have it in Europe,",
      " because it is a way to blindfolded the people, that's what Ronald Reagan said. Ronald Regan opposed the value tax because he said it was a way to blindfold the people, so the true cost of government was not there there for them.\n\nNow, you can support one now that's very low. But what is to prevent a future liberal president or a liberal Congress from coming back and not just raising the income tax, but also raising that VAT tax, and that vat tax is really bad for seniors. Because seniors, if they are retired, are no longer earning an income from a job. And therefore, they don't get the income tax break,",
      " but their prices are going to be higher, because the vat tax is embedded in both the prices that business that are charging and in the wages they pay their employees.\n\nWhen I am president of the United States, I'm going to side with Ronald Regan on this and not Nancy Pelosi and we are not having a vat tax.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you senator.\n\nCRUZ: Maria, I assume that I can respond to that.\n\nBARTIROMO: Senator Cruz, yes. You were meant to. Yes, of course.\n\nCRUZ: Well, Marco has been floating this attack for a few weeks now,",
      " but the problem is, the business flat tax in my proposal is not a vat. A vat is imposed as a sales tax when you buy a good.\n\nThis is a business flat tax. It is imposed on business and a critical piece that Marco seems to be missing is that this 16 percent business flat tax enables us to eliminate the corporate income tax. It goes away. It enables us to eliminate the death tax.\n\nIf you're a farmer, if you're a rancher, if you are small business owner, the death tax is gone. We eliminate the payroll tax, we eliminate the Obamacare taxes. And listen, there is a real difference between Marco's tax plan and mine.\n\nMine gives every American a simple,",
      " flat tax of 10 percent. Marco's top tax rate is 35 percent. My tax plan enables you to fill out your taxes on a postcard so we can abolish the IRS. Marco leaves the IRS code in with all of the complexity. We need to break the Washington cartel, and the only way to do it is to end all the subsidies and all...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... the mandates and have a simple flat tax. The final observation, invoked Ronald Reagan. I would note that Art Laffer, Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, has written publicly, that my simple flat tax is the best tax plan of any of the individuals on this stage cause it produces economic growth,",
      " it raises wages and it helps everyone from the very poorest to the very richest.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: But that's not an accurate description of the plan. Because, first of all, you may rename the IRS but you are not going to abolishes the IRS, because there has to be some agency that's going to collect your vat tax. Someone's going to be collecting this tax.\n\nIn fact, Ronald Reagan's treasury, when Ronald Reagan's treasury looked at the vat tax, you know what they found? That they were going to have to hire 20,000 new IRS agencies to collect it.\n\nThe second point,",
      " it does not eliminate the corporate tax or the payroll tax. Businesses will now have to pay 16 percent on the money they make. They will also have to pay 16 percent on the money they pay their employees.\n\nSo there are people watching tonight in business. If you are now hit on a 60 percent tax on both your income and on the wages you pay your employees, where are you going to get that money from? You're going to get it by paying your employees less and charging your customers more, that is a tax, the difference is, you don't see it on the bill.\n\nAnd that's why Ronald Reagan said that it was a blindfold.",
      " You blindfold the American people so that they cannot see the true cost of government. Now 16 percent is what the rate Ted wants it at. But what happens if, God forbid, the next Barack Obama takes over, and the next Nancy Pelosi, and the next Harry Reid...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nand they decide, we're going to raise it to 30 percent, plus we're going to raise the income tax to 30 percent. Now, you've got Europe.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you senator. I have to get to a question for Mr. Trump.\n\nCRUZ: Maria...\n\nBARTIROMO:",
      " Yes.\n\nCRUZ: Maria, I'd just like to say...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCHRISTIE: Maria, I'd like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the Senate to actually answer the question you asked, which was on entitlements. Do you remember that, everybody? This was a question on entitlements.\n\nAnd the reason -- and the reason...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCHRISTIE:... no, you already had your chance, Marco, and you blew it. Here's the thing.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCHRISTIE: The fact is, the reason why...\n\nRUBIO: If you'll answer the (inaudible)",
      " core question.\n\nCHRISTIE:... the fact is -- the fact is the reason why that no one wants to answer entitlements up here is because it's hard. It's a hard problem. And I'm the only one up on this stage who back in April put forward a detailed entitlement reform plan that will save over $1 trillion, save Social Security, save Medicare, and avoid this -- avoid what Hillary Rodham Clinton will do to you.\n\nBecause what she will do is come in and she will raise Social Security taxes. Bernie Sanders has already said it. And she is just one or two more poll drops down from even moving further left than she's moved already to get to the left of Bernie on this.\n\nWe have seniors out there who are scared to death because this Congress -- this one that we have right now,",
      " just stole $150 billion from the Social Security retirement fund to give it to the Social Security disability fund. A Republican Congress did that.\n\nAnd the fact is it was wrong. And they consorted with Barack Obama to steal from Social Security. We need to reform Social Security. Mine is the only plan that saves over $1 trillion and that's why I'm answering your question.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor.\n\n(APPLAUSE) CARSON: Can I just add one very quick thing? And I just want to say, you know, last week we released our tax plan. And multiple reputable journals,",
      " including The Wall Street Journal, said ours is the best. Just want to get that out there, just saying.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\n\nComing up, how would the candidates protect America, and another terror attack, if we were to see it. But first, you can join us live on stage during the commercial break right from home. Go to facebook.com/foxbusiness. We'll be streaming live and answering your questions during this break next.\n\nMore from South Carolina coming up. Stay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBARTIROMO: Mr. Trump, your net worth is in the multi-billions of dollars and have an ongoing thriving hotel and real estate business.",
      " Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become president? With such vast wealth, how difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America's interest first?\n\nTRUMP: Well, it's an interesting question because I'm very proud of my company. As you too know, I know I built a very great company. But if I become president, I couldn't care less about my company. It's peanuts.\n\nI want to use that same up here, whatever it may be to make America rich again and to make America great again. I have Ivanka, and Eric and Don sitting there.",
      " Run the company kids, have a good time. I'm going to do it for America.\n\nSo I would -- I would be willing to do that.\n\nBARTIROMO: So you'll put your assets in a blind trust?\n\nTRUMP: I would put it in a blind trust. Well, I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it. If that's a blind trust, I don't know. But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved because I wouldn't care about anything but our country, anything.\n\nBARTIROMO:",
      " Thank you sir.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you.\n\nCAVUTO: Governor Christie, going back to your U.S. Attorney days, you had been praised by both parties as certainly a tough law and order guy. So I wonder what you make of recent statistics that showed violent crimes that have been spiking sometimes by double digit ratings in 30 cities across the country. Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn said, \"most local law enforcement officials feel abandoned by Washington.\" Former NYC Police Chief Ray Kelly, says that, \"police are being less proactive because they're being overly scrutinized and second guessed and they're afraid of being sued or thrown in jail.\"\n\nWhat would you do as president to address this?\n\nCHRISTIE:",
      " Well, first off, let's face it, the FBI director James Comey was a friend of mine who I worked with as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. He was the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan. He said, \"there's a chill wind blowing through law enforcement in this country.\" Here's why, the president of the United States and both his attorney's general, they give the benefit of the doubt to the criminal, not to the police officers.\n\nThat's the truth of the matter and you see it every time with this president. Every time he's got a chance, going all the way back to -- remember that Great Beer Summit he had after he messed up that time.",
      " This is a guy who just believes that law enforcement are the bad guys.\n\nNow, I for seven years was the U.S. Attorney of New Jersey. I worked hard with not only federal agents but with police officers and here's the problem, sanctuary cities is part of the problem in this country. That's where crime is happening in these cities where they don't enforce the immigration laws. And this president turns his back -- this president doesn't enforce the marijuana laws in this country because he doesn't agree with them.\n\nAnd he allows states to go ahead and do whatever they want on a substance that's illegal. This president allows lawlessness throughout this country.",
      " Here's what I would do Neil, I would appoint an Attorney General and I would have one very brief conversation with that Attorney General. I'd say, \"General, enforce the law against everyone justly, fairly, and aggressively. Make our streets safe again. Make our police officers proud of what they do but more important than that, let them know how proud we are of them.\"\n\nWe do that, this country would be safe and secure again not only from criminals but from the terrorist who threaten us as well. I'm the only person on this stage who's done that and we will get it done as President of the United States.\n\nCAVUTO:",
      " Thank you governor.\n\nGovernor Kasich, as someone has to deal with controversial police shootings in your own state, what do you make of Chicago's move recently to sort of retrain police? Maybe make them not so quick to use their guns?\n\nKASICH: Well, I created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement, community people, clergy and the person that I named as one of the co-chair was a lady by the name of Nina Turner, a former State Senator, a liberal Democrat. She actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety.\n\nKASICH: And they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police.\n\nKASICH:",
      " And they came back with 23 recommendations. One of them is a statewide use of deadly force. And it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of Ohio. Secondly, a policy on recruiting and hiring, and then more resources for -- for training.\n\nBut let me also tell you, one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police. Community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night, and not -- not to lose their life. Their family is waiting for them.\n\nAt the same time, law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them,",
      " but works against them.\n\nSee, in Ohio, we've had some controversial decisions. But the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine, but violence is wrong. And it has been a remarkable situation in our state. And as president of the United States, it's all about communication, folks. It's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems.\n\nAnd when you do that, you will be amazed at how much progress you can make, and how much healing we can have. Because, folks, at the end of the day, the country needs healed. I've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight,",
      " but I've got to tell you, as somebody that actually passed a budget; that paid down a half-a-trillion dollars of our national debt, you can't do it alone. You've got to bring people together. You've got to give people hope.\n\nAnd together, we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal America. And that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods, our families, our children, and our grandchildren.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCAVUTO: Thank you, Governor.\n\nBARTIROMO: Senator Rubio?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nUnder current law, the U.S. is on track to issue more new permanent immigrants on green cards over the next five years than the entire population of South Carolina.",
      " The CBO says your 2013 immigration bill would have increased green cardholders by another 10 million over 10 years.\n\nWhy are you so interested in opening up borders to foreigners when American workers have a hard enough time finding work?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, this is an issue that's been debated now for 30 years. And for 30 years, the issue of immigration has been about someone who's in this country, maybe they're here illegally, but they're looking for a job. This issue is not about that anymore.\n\nFirst and foremost, this issue has to be now more than anything else about keeping America safe.",
      " And here's why. There is a radical jihadist group that is manipulating our immigration system. And not just green cards. They're looking -- they're recruiting people that enter this country as doctors and engineers and even fiances. They understand the vulnerabilities we have on the southern border.\n\nThey're looking -- they're looking to manipulate our -- the visa waiver countries to get people into the United States. So our number one priority must now become ensuring that ISIS cannot get killers into the United States. So whether it's green cards or any other form of entry into America, when I'm president if we do not know who you are or why you are coming,",
      " you are not going to get into the United States of America.\n\nBARTIROMO: So your thinking has changed?\n\nRUBIO: The issue is a dramatically different issue than it was 24 months ago. Twenty-four months ago, 36 months ago, you did not have a group of radical crazies named ISIS who were burning people in cages and recruiting people to enter our country legally. They have a sophisticated understanding of our legal immigration system and we now have an obligation to ensure that they are not able to use that system against us.\n\nThe entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost,",
      " with an eye on ISIS. Because they're recruiting people to enter this country as engineers, posing as doctors, posing as refugees. We know this for a fact. They've contacted the trafficking networks in the Western Hemisphere to get people in through the southern border. And they got a killer in San Bernardino in posing as a fiance.\n\nThis issue now has to be about stopping ISIS entering the United States, and when I'm president we will.\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: But Maria, radical Islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago; 24 months ago, we had Al Qaida.",
      " We had Boko Haram. We had Hamas. We had Hezbollah. We had Iran putting operatives in South America and Central America. It's the reason why I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and led the fight to stop the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, because it was clear then, like it's clear now, that border security is national security.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you, Senator.\n\nCRUZ: It is also the case that that Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill, one of the things it did is it expanded Barack Obama's power to let in Syrian refugees. It enabled him -- the president to certify them en masse without mandating meaningful background checks.\n\nI think that's a mistake.",
      " That's why I've been leading the fight to stop it. And I would note the Senate just a few weeks ago voted to suspend refugees from Middle Eastern countries. I voted yes to suspend that. Marco voted on the other side. So you don't get to say we need to secure the borders, and at the same time try to give Barack Obama more authority to allow Middle Eastern refugees coming in, when the head of the FBI tells us they cannot vet them to determine if they are ISIS terrorists.\n\nRUBIO: Maria, let me clear something up here. This is an interesting point when you talk about immigration.\n\nRUBIO:",
      " Ted Cruz, you used to say you supported doubling the number of green cards, now you say that you're against it. You used to support a 500 percent increase in the number of guest workers, now you say that you're against it. You used to support legalizing people that were here illegally, now you say you're against it. You used to say that you were in favor of birthright citizenship, now you say that you are against it.\n\nAnd by the way, it's not just on immigration, you used to support TPA, now you say you're against it. I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance because they told you it would help you in Iowa,",
      " and last week, we all saw you flip your vote on ethanol in Iowa for the same reason.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThat is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation. When I am president, I will work consistently every single day to keep this country safe, not call Edward Snowden, as you did, a great public servant. Edward Snowden is a traitor. And if I am president and we get our hands on him, he is standing trial for treason.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd one more point, one more point. Every single time that there has been a Defense bill in the Senate, three people team up to vote against it.",
      " Bernie Sanders, Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. In fact, the only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget from Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense.\n\nHere's the bottom line, and I'll close with this. If I'm president of the United States and Congress tries to cut the military, I will veto that in a millisecond.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: There's -- look, there's --\n\nCAVUTO: Gentlemen, gentlemen --\n\nCRUZ: I'm going to get a response to that, Neil.

They're absolutely false.\n\nAUDIENCE: Boo.\n\nCRUZ: So let's start -- let's start with immigration. Let's start with immigration and have a little bit of clarity. Marco stood with Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama on amnesty.",
      " I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King. Marco stood today, standing on this stage Marco supports legalization and citizenship for 12 million illegals. I opposed and oppose legalization and citizenship.\n\nAnd by the way, the attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget, Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion. What he said, and he said it in the last debate, it's simply not true. And as president, I will rebuild the military and keep this country safe.\n\nCAVUTO: All right, gentlemen, we've got to stop. I know you are very passionate about that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGovernor Bush,",
      " fears have gripped this country obviously, and you touched on it earlier since the San Bernardino attacks. Since our last debate, the national conversation has changed, according to Facebook data as well.\n\nNow this first graphic shows the issues that were most talked about right before those attacks and now after: the issues of Islam, homeland security and ISIS now loom very large. The FBI says Islamic radicals are using social media to communicate and that it needs better access to communication. Now the CEO of Apple, Governor, Tim Cook said unless served with a warrant private communication is private, period. Do you agree, or would you try to convince him otherwise?\n\nBUSH:",
      " I would try to convince him otherwise, but this last back and forth between two senators -- back bench senators, you know, explains why we have the mess in Washington, D.C. We need a president that will fix our immigration laws and stick with it, not bend with the wind.\n\nThe simple fact is one of the ways, Maria, to solve the problem you described is narrow the number of people coming by family petitioning to what every other country has so that we have the best and the brightest that come to our country. We need to control the border, we need to do all of this in a comprehensive way, not just going back and forth and talking about stuff --\n\nCAVUTO:",
      " Would you answer this question?\n\nBUSH: Oh, I'll talk about that, too. But you haven't asked me a question in a while, Neil, so I thought I'd get that off my chest if you don't mind.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCAVUTO: Fair enough. So Tim Cook -- so Tim Cook says he's going to keep it private.\n\nBUSH: I got that. And the problem today is there's no confidence in Washington, D.C. There needs to be more than one meeting, there needs to complete dialogue with the large technology companies. They understand that there's a national security risk.",
      " We ought to give them a little bit of a liability release so that they share data amongst themselves and share data with the federal government, they're not fearful of a lawsuit.\n\nWe need to make sure that we keep the country safe. This is the first priority. The cybersecurity challenges that we face, this administration failed us completely, completely. Not just the hacking of OPM, but that is -- that is just shameful. 23 million files in the hands of the Chinese? So it's not just the government -- the private sector companies, it's also our own government that needs to raise the level of our game.\n\nWe should put the NSA in charge of the civilian side of this as well.",
      " That expertise needs to spread all across the government and there needs to be much more cooperation with our private sector.\n\nCAVUTO: But if Tim cook is telling you no, Mr. President.\n\nBUSH: You've got to keep asking. You've got to keep asking because this is a hugely important issue. If you can encrypt messages, ISIS can, over these platforms, and we have no ability to have a cooperative relationship --\n\nCAVUTO: Do you ask or do you order?\n\nBUSH: Well, if the law would change, yeah. But I think there has to be recognition that if we -- if we are too punitive,",

So there's a lot of balanced interests. But the president leads in this regard. That's what we need.

We feel like we're being left behind and left out.\n\nAnd the reason is simple: because in 2008, we elected as president someone who wasn't interested in fixing America.

      " The 12 biggest moments of the GOP debate\n\nA smaller cast featured harder hits Thursday, as seven top-polling Republican presidential candidates sought to leave a lasting impression with 18 days until voting begins in Iowa. Here are the most memorable moments:\n\n1. Citizenship melee\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTed Cruz unloaded on Donald Trump with his most forceful salvo yet, rejecting any suggestion that he's ineligible to be president because he was born on Canadian soil to an American mother. Cruz noted that many people supporting Trump's theory also believe that citizenship requires two American parents born on American soil.\n\n\"Since September the constitution hasn\u2019t changed, but the poll numbers have,\" Cruz said.",
      " \"I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling \u2026 but the facts of the law here are clear.\"\n\nHe added that if Trump's backers are right, Trump himself wouldn't be eligible because his mother was born in Scotland. \"On the issue of citizenship, Donald, I\u2019m not going to use your mother\u2019s birth against you,\" he said.\n\n2. New York values\n\nCruz elaborated on his recent Trump dig, accusing the mogul of having \"New York values.\" He said he meant that New Yorkers tend to value \"money and media\" and are socially liberal on issues from abortion to same-sex marriage. Riffing on Trump's dig at him -- that not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba -- he charged,",
      " \"Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan.\"\n\nTrump delivered a somber and indignant reply, reminding the audience that New York was watched by the world as it responded to the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\"We rebuilt downtown Manhattan... everybody in the world loved New York and loved New Yorkers,\" he said. \"And I have to tell you, that was a very insulting statement Ted made.\"\n\n3.Trump-Cruz or Cruz-Trump\n\nThe brawl over citizenship also led to an unusual exchange in which Trump and Cruz each appeared, sarcastically, to offer each other the vice presidential slot on their ticket. Trump,",
      " playing out a hypothetical, said that he might consider choosing Cruz as his running mate but that Cruz might be sued by Democrats over his citizenship.\n\n\"I choose him as my vice presidential candidate, and the Democrats sue because we can\u2019t take him along for the ride,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t like that.\"\n\nCruz replied with a joke \u2014 when he's the nominee, Trump can be his vice presidential pick, and if his citizenship theory is right, Trump will become president.\n\n\"Donald, you \u2014 you very kindly just a moment ago offered me the V.P. slot,\" he said. \"I'll tell you what. If this all works out,",
      " I'm happy to consider naming you as V.P. So if you happen to be right, you could get the top job at the end of the day.\"\n\n4. Cruz takes on the Times\n\nTed Cruz was practically salivating when moderator Maria Bartiromo asked him to respond to The New York Times report that nicked him for failing to disclose a $1 million loan from Goldman Sachs while running for Senate in 2012. Cruz quickly labeled the story a \"hit piece\" and thrashed the paper -- already a low-hanging conservative foil.\n\nCruz pointed out that he's been the subject of Times columnist Frank Bruni's ire.\n\n\"That same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the movie 'It Follows,'\" Cruz said.",
      " \"The New York Times and I don\u2019t really have the warmest of relationships.\"\n\nCruz said the undisclosed loan was a \"paperwork error.\" \"If that's the best hit the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well,\" he said.\n\n5. Senate squabble\n\nSen. Marco Rubio and Cruz locked horns late in the debate over immigration, with Rubio accusing Cruz of repeatedly changing positions for political expedience, and he didn't stop at immigration issues.\n\n\"I saw you on the Senate floor flip your vote on crop insurance,\" he said. \"That is not consistent conservatism\"\n\nCruz retorted, \"I appreciate you dumping your oppo research folder,\" to which Rubio shot back,",
      " \"No, it\u2019s your record.\"\n\n6. \"I hope you'll reconsider\"\n\nJeb Bush jumped in after Trump defended his plan to ban Muslim immigration into the United States, pleading with the GOP poll leader to change his views.\n\n\"I hope you reconsider this because this policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to take out ISIS,\" Bush said. \"The Kurds are our strongest ally, they\u2019re Muslim.\"\n\n\"All Muslims? Seriously?\" he asked.\n\nTrump countered that he's simply seeking security.\n\n\"I want security for this country,\" he said. \"We have a serious problem with, as you know, radical Islam.\"\n\n7.",
      " Christie intervenes in Rubio-Cruz tussle\n\nRubio and Cruz criticized each other in harsh terms over their competing tax plans, a wonky clash that centered on their interpretation of value-added taxes on business.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to side with Ronald Reagan on this and not Nancy Pelosi,\" Rubio charged.\n\nCruz countered that Reagan economist Art Laffer backed his plan. After Rubio countered again, suggesting Cruz's plan to abolish the IRS would fail, Chris Christie jumped in to remind viewers that the two senators were initially asked to talk about entitlement programs. Rubio said he'd get to entitlements, but Christie cut him off.\n\n\"You already had your chance,",
      " Marco, you blew it,\" he said.\n\n8. Trump talks trade and tariffs\n\nDonald Trump, facing questions for telling The New York Times that he'd consider a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, lashed out at the paper, following Ted Cruz's smackdown of the Times earlier.\n\n\"It\u2019s the New York Times, they\u2019re always wrong,\" he said.\n\nTrump said he's \"open to a tariff\" but only mentioned 45 percent to suggest what the rate would have to be to offset China's currency devaluation.\n\n\"If they don\u2019t start treating us fairly and stop devaluing and let their currency rise so our companies can compete,\" he said,",
      " \"I would certainly start taxing goods coming in from China.\"\n\n9. Christie hurls insults at Obama\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has long aimed memorably nasty barbs at the president, and he continued Thursday, calling him a \"petulant child\" for pursuing executive actions to implement his favored policies. But he ratcheted up the schoolyard language in the debate.\n\n\"We are going to kick your rear end out of the white house come this fall,\" Christie said after pointing out that Democrats have been routed from governorships and lost their majorities in Congress throughout Obama's tenure.\n\n10. Trump: My kids will run my company\n\nTrump talked logistics for transferring control of his company to his kids if he takes the White House.\n\n\"If I'm elected president,",
      " I couldn't care less about my company, \" he said.\n\n\u201cI have Ivanka and Eric and Don sitting there,\u201d he said, gesturing toward his kids in the debate audience. \u201cRun the company kids. Have a good time. I\u2019m gonna do it for America.\u201d\n\nTrump initially suggested the arrangement would constitute a \"blind trust,\" but then noted that might not be the case because they're his children.\n\n11. Carson gets apocalyptic\n\nBen Carson criticized Barack Obama for being naive on foreign policy, but in doing so outlined a terrifying scenario in which a nuclear blast takes out America's electric grid while they're also using dirty bombs to attack and using cyber attacks to take down American computer systems.\n\n\"I mean,",
      " just think about a scenario like that. They explode the bomb, we have an electromagnetic pulse. They hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs,\" he said. \"Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point? He needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us.\"\n\n12. One-way ticket to Guantanamo\n\nMarco Rubio hinted that he'd get pretty aggressive with terrorists caught by the United States. Describing a muscular approach to taking on \"radical jihadist terrorists,\" Rubio said he had a plan for those caught on the battlefield: \"A one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay Cuba, and we are going to find out anything they know.\"\n\n\"It is a war that either they win or we win,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAuthors:\n"

    "answer": "\u2013 For those wondering who was going to go after who in Thursday night's GOP debate in Houston, it was pretty clear early on that both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were focused on front-runner Donald Trump\u2014and he gave what they sent his way right back, specifically on the topic of immigration. When Rubio accused Trump of flip-flopping on the issue, Trump responded: \"I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people,\" per the New York Times, adding he had hired \"tens of thousands of people\" over his career. Rubio perked up and continued the \"fireworks,\" as the Washington Post put it, telling the audience to Google \"Trump and Polish workers\" about Trump's hiring of foreign workers and how he'd been fined for it. Trump mentioned how it had been hard to find workers in the hottest parts of Florida and that they were part-time seasonal workers. Enter Cruz, who didn't waste his opportunity to jump in and note that he was leading the fight against amnesty in 2013 while Trump was \"firing Dennis Rodman on Celebrity Apprentice,\" per the Times. Trump's immediate eyeroll came in the form of: \"I've had an amazing relationship with politicians both Democrat [and] Republican because I was a businessman,\" he said, per the Post. \"You get along with nobody,\" he told Cruz. \"You don't have one Republican senator backing you ... and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. ... You should be ashamed of yourself.\" On the CNN live blog, Leigh Munsil of the Blaze ponders, \"Watching Cruz and Rubio team up to take on Trump makes you wonder what the race would look like if they'd done it sooner.\"\n",

      "Photo: Eric Thayer for The New York Times; Video: By CNN\n\nFew criticisms cut at Senator Ted Cruz like being called a liar. It undermines the central tenet of his candidacy, that he is a trusted conservative, his principles inviolable.\n\nSo when Donald J. Trump did just that during the debate \u2014 \u201cThis guy is a liar,\u201d he said, meaning Mr. Cruz \u2014 the Texas senator was outraged.\n\nThe moderator, Wolf Blitzer, was ready to move on from an exchange that was already descending into bitterness and acrimony. \u201cYou\u2019re going to say that I can\u2019t respond to being called a liar?\u201d Mr.",
      " Cruz demanded. Mr. Blitzer let him finish.\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s response? Mr. Trump is the real liar.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you something,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cFalsely accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and it\u2019s something Donald does daily.\u201d\n\nWhatever civility might have remained in that exchange eroded from there, and it ended up as a barely intelligible shouting match.

For a generation, they defined conservatism as limited government and free enterprise and a strong national defense. But they also appealed to our hopes and our dreams. Now we have to decide if we are still that kind of party and still that kind of movement, or if we're simply going to become a party that preys on people's angers and fears.\n\nI hope we remain that conservative movement that appeals to our hopes and our dreams and the belief that America will always be better in its future than it's been in its story history.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER:",

Voters in the first four states have spoken, and Mr. Trump has emerged as the frontrunner, but in five days the candidates will face their biggest test yet, Super Tuesday. When nearly half of the delegates needed to win the Republican nomination will be awarded,",
      " and the biggest prize of the night is Texas.\n\nImmigration is a key issue in this state, for all voters nationwide, including the many people watching us on Telemundo. So, that's where we begin.\n\nMr. Trump, you've called for a deportation force to remove the 11 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. You've also promised to let what you call, \"the good ones\", come back in. Your words, \"the good ones\", after they've been deported.\n\nSenator Cruz would not allow them to come back in. He says that's the biggest difference between the two of you. He calls your plan amnesty.",
      " Is it?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had.\n\nAs far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn't even be a big subject.\n\nBut, we either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out.",
      " They will come back -- some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine.\n\nThey're going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Senator Cruz, what's wrong with letting what Mr. Trump calls, \"the good ones\" come back to the United States?\n\nCRUZ: You know, the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country -- our millions of Americans who are losing their jobs.",
      " Millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down.\n\nYou know, in the past couple of weeks the Wall Street Journal had a very interesting article about the state of Arizona. Arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration, and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state, and what's happened there -- it was a very interesting article.\n\nSome of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up, and from their perspective that was a bad thing. But, what the state of Arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare, on prisons, and education, all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      " And, the Americans, and for that matter, the legal immigrants who are in Arizona, are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise. That's who we need to be fighting for.\n\nListen, we have always welcomed legal immigrants, but I think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become U.S. citizens, and that's why I've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally, and that's why I will do the same thing as president.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Mr. Trump, do you want to respond to that? TRUMP: Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio,",
      " and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Senator Rubio?\n\nRUBIO: Senator Cruz has called your immigration plan amnesty, and has an add out there comparing it to President Obama's. He says both of you support allowing undocumented immigrants legal status here in the United States after a background check, paying a fine, and paying taxes.\n\nAre those claims correct?\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, and before we do anything, I've been abundantly clear on this. When I'm president of the United States, before we do anything on immigration, we are going to secure the border.",
      " And, that's not just the physical border with Mexico, it's Visa overstays. That's 45 percent of the problem right there.\n\nRUBIO: It also has to do -- that's why we need e-verify, and entry-exit tracking system, and so-forth. And, until that happens, we're not doing anything else. And then we'll see what the American people are willing to support.\n\nAnd Donald mentioned, because he mentioned me in his answer, that his position on immigration is what has driven this debate. Well, the truth is, though, that a lot of these positions that he's now taking are new to him.\n\nIn 2011,",
      " he talked about the need for a pathway to citizenship. In 2012, Donald criticized Mitt Romney, saying that Mitt lost his election because of self-deportation.\n\nAnd so even today, we saw a report in one of the newspapers that Donald, you've hired a significant number of people from other countries to take jobs that Americans could have filled.\n\nMy mom and dad -- my mom was a maid at a hotel, and instead of hiring an American like her, you have brought in over a thousand people from all over the world to fill those jobs instead.\n\nSo I think this is an important issue. And I think we are realizing increasingly that it's an important issue for the country that has been debated for 30 years,",
      " but finally needs to be solved once and for all.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left.\n\nSelf-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out.\n\nAs far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season,",
      " like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It's the up season. People didn't want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get.\n\nEverybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.\n\nRUBIO: That -- my point that I made was you had criticized Mitt Romney for self-deportation. You said that his strategy of self- deportation is why he lost the election.\n\nAnd I think people in Florida would be surprised,",
      " because, in fact, the article that was today, they interviewed a number of people that would have been willing to do those jobs, if you would have been willing to hire them to do it.\n\nTRUMP: I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That's what I criticize Mitt Romney -- I mean, ran...\n\nRUBIO: No, he...\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That's an election that should have been won.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO:",

I think it's fine, it's an important point that you raise and we discuss on immigration. This is a big issue for Texas, a huge issue for the country.\n\nBut I also think that if you're going to claim that you're the only one that lifted this into the campaign,",
      " that you acknowledge that, for example, you're only person on this stage that has ever been fined for hiring people to work on your projects illegally.\n\nYou hired some workers from Poland...\n\nTRUMP: No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: In fact, some of the people...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: And by the way, I've hired -- and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job.

That's wrong. Totally wrong.\n\nRUBIO: That's a fact. People can look it up. I'm sure people are Googling it right now.

Nobody up here has hired anybody.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Senator Cruz, you say you want to deport the 11 million undocumented immigrants, but you never want to allow them to come back to the United States. What would happen to the children who are U.S.- born citizens whose parent will be deported under your plan?\n\nCRUZ: Well, existing law provides that those who are deported cannot come back here legally. U.S. citizens can come back. That's existing law.\n\nBut let me say, Wolf, I really find it amazing that Donald believes that he is the one who discovered the issue of illegal immigration.",

And in 2013, when I was fight against the \"gang of eight\" amnesty bill, where was Donald? He was firing Dennis Rodman on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\"\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCRUZ: And indeed, if you look at the \"gang of eight,\" one individual on this stage broke his promise to the men and women who elected him and wrote the amnesty bill.\n\nCRUZ: If you look at the eight members of the Gang of Eight,",

And I'm the only one on this stage that has that record. And by the way, Marco is exactly right that a federal court found Donald guilty of being part of a conspiracy to hire people illegally and entered a $1 million judgment against him.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER:",

And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now -- your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you.\n\nI've had an amazing relationship with politicians -- with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody.\n\nYou get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican -- you don't have one Republican senator,",

He's been waiting patiently.\n\nGovernor Kasich, the idea -- you've said this, and I want to quote you now: \"The idea that we're going to deport all these people is ludicrous and everybody knows it.\" Those are your words. Should people be allowed to break the law just because it's not feasible to stop them?\n\nKASICH: Look, we have a great president here, George Bush, the 41st president of the United States. He worked with Ronald Reagan to pass an effort to try to solve this problem -- a path to legalization. You see, that was a time when things worked.",
      " It was a time when President Reagan and George Bush decided that we needed to make the country work.\n\nLook, I think there is an answer here. The answer is you complete the border. You let people know that once it's done, you don't have a right to come in. If you come in, we don't want any excuse. You're going to go back. But I favor a guest worker program. I think it's practical. And I think for the 11 million or 11.5 million Americans -- the illegals that are here, if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, I'd make them pay a fine,",
      " some back taxes, maybe some community service. And at the end, I'd give them a path to legalization, but not a path to citizenship. I don't think we're going to tear families apart. I don't think we're going to ride around in people's neighborhoods and grab people out of their homes. I don't think -- first of all, I don't think it's practical and I don't think it reflects America.\n\nYou know what happened? The problem with President Reagan is we didn't get in there and actually finish the border. And I think it was probably business interests that affected it. But at the end of the day,",
      " let's be practical. Let's start solving problems in this country instead of kicking them upstairs. With President Reagan and George Bush, it was a bipartisan coalition to address the issue, and I think we can and should do it again. And I will have a plan in the first 100 days to get it done and get this issue behind us.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Governor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDr. Carson, you've been critical of mass deportation. You said back in November you don't think Mr. Trump's plan necessarily represents the Republican Party. Given how well Mr. Trump has been doing with the Republican primary voters,",
      " do you still believe that?\n\nCARSON: I believe in liberty and justice for all. I think everything that we do should be fair. And I've already described -- you know, how we can secure the border.\n\nWe need to secure all the borders, because it's not just people coming in from South America and Mexico, but there are terrorists who want to destroy us, who are getting across our borders fairly easily. And we have to stop that.\n\nBut in terms of the people who are here already, after we -- after we stop the illegal immigration, we need to be reasonable. And I would give them a six-month period in which to get registered as a guest worker,",
      " assuming that they have an acceptable record.\n\nThey have to pay a back-tax penalty, have to pay taxes going forward, but they don't have to live underground anymore. And I think they do not become American citizens, they do not vote.\n\nIf they want to become an American citizen, they go through exactly the same process that anybody else goes through. I think that's the kind of situation that is actually fair to people.\n\nAnd we have other ways of -- of utilizing our facilities and our talents as foreign aid: doing things in South America and Central America and Mexico that improve the economy there, so that they don't feel the need to come over here.",
      " That would cost us a lot less than borrowing money from China, paying interest on it.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Dr. Carson.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nMr. Trump, your campaign, as you well remember, began with the idea of building a wall along the southern border.\n\nTRUMP: (inaudible).\n\nBLITZER: It's about 315 miles southwest of where we are right now. You've said the Mexican government will pay for it.\n\nTRUMP: Correct.\n\nBLITZER: The spokesperson for the current president of Mexico says that will never happen. The last two presidents of Mexico say that will never happen.",
      " In fact, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox -- he said today, and I'm quoting him -- he said, \"I'm not going to pay for that,\" quote, \"effing wall.\"\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSo if you don't get an actual check from the Mexican government for $8 billion or $10 billion or $12 billion, whatever it will cost, how are you going to make them pay for the wall?\n\nTRUMP: I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nIt just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that -- I saw him make the statement.",
      " I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal.\n\nThis guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country.\n\nWe're going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it,",
      " it'll end up costing $200 billion.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBut the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 -- you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago -- 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers.\n\nWe can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work.\n\nMexico will pay for it,",
      " because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\n... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: If the -- if the Mexicans don't pay for the wall, will you start a trade war with Mexico?\n\nTRUMP: Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. (APPLAUSE)\n\nWe're losing so much with Mexico and China -- with China,",
      " we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, \"don't we want to trade?\" I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion.\n\nMexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago.\n\nAnd I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind.\n\nBLITZER:",

Maria?\n\nCELESTE: Senator Rubio, last week, you said that on your first day in office, you will get rid of President Obama's executive action known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA for short.\n\nRUBIO: Correct.\n\nARRASAS: It is a program that has protected hundreds of thousands of young people that came here when they were children, brought to the U.S. by undocumented immigrants. This is the only home they know, and that is a dramatic change from last April when you said in Spanish, and I'm going to quote you (in Spanish)",
      " which translates to DACA is going to have to end at some point, but it wouldn't be fair to cancel it immediately.\n\nSo Senator Rubio, what changed?\n\nRUBIO: It didn't change.\n\nARRASAS: Why is it now fair to cancel it on Day One?\n\nRUBIO: No, it's the same policy. It will have to end at some moment, and as I said, we will -- we will eliminate that executive order. The people that are on it now will not be allowed to renew it, and new applicants will not be allowed to apply to it. And it's not because we're not compassionate to the plight of a 2 -- someone who came here when they were 2 years old.",
      " I understand. I know people that are personally impacted by this.\n\nThe problem with the executive order is it is unconstitutional. The president doesn't have the power to do that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd he himself admitted that.\n\nARRASAS: Senator, Senator...\n\nRUBIO: I'm sorry, but let me finish my...\n\nARRASAS:... but you went -- you went from saying that it was deeply disruptive to deport them immediately to deport them on Day One.\n\nRUBIO: No, but this is not about deportation. Everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation. This is about DACA. DACA is an executive order that is unconstitutional.",
      " I will cancel it on my first day in office, which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire, and new people will not be allowed to apply for them.\n\nNow, I am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own, but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional. No matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause, we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States the way this president now does on a regular basis.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nARRASAS: Senator Rubio, you accused Senator Cruz in a previous debate of lying when he said that you said one thing in Spanish and another one in English.",
      " So in what sense did he lie?\n\nRUBIO: Because it is not true that I'm not going to get rid of DACA. I am going to get rid of DACA. In the Spanish interview, you just read out the transcript in Spanish, I said, it will have to end at some point. That point will be when I eliminate the executive order and the people who have those permits when they expire will not be allowed to renew it. And new people will not be able to apply. In fact, I don't even think we should be taking new enrollees in the program now.\n\nThat is how the program ends and how you wind it down is you allow the people who are on it,",

Well, it'll have to end some day, not immediately, but someday in the future.\n\nThat, inevitably, is when a politician doesn't plan to end it at all.\n\nYou know, I'm reminded of that that is the same position that Marco took in Iowa on ethanol subsidies. When I campaigned in Iowa, I took on the lobbyists,",
      " took on the corporate welfare and said we should have no ethanol subsidies.\n\nMarco's position was the same as it is to illegal amnesty. Well, someday it should end, just not now. And, frankly, I think we need a president who knows what he believes in, is willing to say it on day one, not at the end of his term when it's somebody else's problem.\n\nRUBIO: That's not an accurate assessment of what I said about ethanol. What I said is that ethanol will phase out, it is phasing out now. By 2022 that program expires by virtue of the existing law, and at that point it will go away.",
      " I don't agree with the mandate and the program that's in place, but I think it's unfair that these people have gone out and invested all this money into this program and we're just going to yank it away from them.\n\nAnd, again, you read the statement in Spanish. I said very clearly on Spanish television, DACA will have to end at some point, and that point is -- at that time I was not a candidate for president. I said it will end in my first day in office as president, and the people who have it now will not be able to renew it. New applicants will not be able to apply.",

As a matter of fact, you are the first hispanic candidate ever to win a caucus or primary.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd yet, there is the perception in the Latino community that instead of trying to prove to Latinos who has the best plan, the best platform to help them,",
      " that you two are spending the time arguing with each other. Trying to figure out which one is tougher on immigration in order to appeal to the majority of Republicans.\n\nSo, my question to you is are you missing a huge opportunity to expand the Republican base?\n\nCRUZ: Well, Maria, you are right. It is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of Cuban immigrants. It really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides.\n\nYou know, I would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal.",
      " That makes sense in the media, but I gotta tell you, one of the things I was most proud of when I ran for Senate here in Texas, I earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in Texas.\n\nAt the same time, Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide. And, the reason is, as you know, you look at the value sin the hispanic community. The values in our community are faith, family, patriotism.\n\nYou know, we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country. And, when I campaigned,",

And, the truth is the Obama-Clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community.

OK. I was mentioned -- just because of the hispanic -- and I'll be brief.\n\nA couple points, number one, I do think it's amazing that on this stage tonight there are two descendants of Cuban origin, and an African American. We are the party of diversity, not the Democratic party.\n\n(APPLAUSE) (CHEERING)\n\nAnd, the second point I would make is that we have to move past this idea that somehow the hispanic community only cares about immigration.\n\nYes,",
      " it's an important issue because we know and love people that have been impacted by it. But, I'm going to tell you that the most powerful sentiment in the hispanic community, as it is in every immigrant community, is the burning desire to leave your children better off than yourself...\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nRUBIO:... and, you can only do that through free enterprise. That's what we stand for, not socialism like Bernie Sanders, and increasingly Hillary Clinton.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nARRASAS: Governor Kasich, after the last presidential election the Republican party realized that in order to win the presidency it needed the support of latinos.",

I mean, I've got to tell you, I was with this little 12-year-old girl, was at a town hall meeting, and she said, you know, I don't like all this yelling and screaming at the debates.",
      " My mother's thinking I might not be able to watch the thing anymore.\n\nI think we ought to move beyond that, about what they think. I'm going to tell you what I think. My position on this whole immigration issue has been clear from the beginning. I haven't changed anything with it.\n\nAnd, look, my view is, we need economic growth. Everything starts with economic growth. And how do you get it?

I did it when I was in Washington, as the Budget Committee chairman,",
      " negotiating actually with Democrats, that gave us surpluses, economic growth, and the same thing in Ohio.\n\nBut here's the thing that I believe. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We have to make sure that everybody has a sense that they can rise.\n\nOf course, our friends in the Hispanic community, our friends in the African-American community, the promise of America is that our system, when we follow the right formula, is going to give opportunity for everyone.\n\nIt's what Jack Kemp used to say. A rising tide lifts all boats, not just some boats, but all boats. And you know what? With me and the Hispanic community,",

      " otherwise they wouldn't pay attention to one more sentence from candidates.\n\nCARSON: OK, well, first of all, let me just mention that last year at the NALEO, the National Association for Latino Elected Officials, I was the only one of 17 Republican candidates to go there.\n\nAnd the reason that I don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that I give is the same message to every group. You know, this is America. And we need to have policies that are -- that give liberty and justice to all people.\n\nAnd that's the way that I have fashioned virtually every policy, looking at that.",
      " And I think that's the way the Republican Party generally thinks. We don't pick and choose winners and losers. We are compassionate.\n\nBut real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of America.

I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places.\n\nThey get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it.

We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that.\n\nTRUMP: We're getting record-setting numbers.

      " Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nI want to turn our attention now to another critically important issue for the American people, the United States Supreme Court, where filling the vacancy left by the late Justice Antonin Scalia has become a major campaign issue. I want to bring in Salem Radio Network host, Hugh Hewitt.\n\nHugh?\n\nHEWITT: Thank you, Wolf.\n\nTo me, it's the most important issue. I'll start with you, Senator Cruz. Do you trust Mr. Trump to nominate conservative justices?\n\nCRUZ: Well, Hugh, I agree with you that it -- Justice Scalia's passing underscores the enormous gravity of this election.",
      " Justice Scalia was someone I knew personally for 20 years; was privileged to be at his funeral this weekend. And with his passing, the court is now hanging in the balance. We are one liberal justice away from a five-justice radical leftist majority that would undermine our religious liberty; that would undermine the right to life; and that would fundamentally erase the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms from the Constitution.\n\nNow, I think the voters of Texas, the voters across Super Tuesday are assessing everyone standing on this -- this stage. In the past, Republican presidents always promise to nominate strict constitutionalists. So I'm certain if you took a survey,",
      " everyone would say they would do that.\n\nBut the reality is, Democrats bat about 1,000. Just about everyone they put on the court votes exactly as they want. Republicans have batted worse than 500, more than half of the people we put on the court have been a disaster.\n\nI've spent my whole life fighting to defend the Bill of Rights and the Constitution. I can tell you, for voters that care about life or marriage or religious liberty or the Second Amendment, they're asking the question: Who do you know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, who do you know will nominate principled constitutionalists to the court?",
      " I give you my word, every justice I nominate will vigorously defend the Bill of Rights for my children and for yours.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump, Senator Cruz mentioned the issue that keeps me up at night, which is religious liberty. Churches, Catholic and Christian colleges, Catholic adoption agencies -- all sorts of religious institutions fear that Hobby Lobby, if it's repealed, it was a five-four decision, they're going to have to bend their knee and provide morning-after pills. They fear that if Bob Jones is expanded, they will lose their tax exemption.\n\nWill you commit to voters tonight that religious liberty will be an absolute litmus test for anyone you appoint,",
      " not just to the Supreme Court, but to all courts?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare.\n\nThat is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge.",
      " But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way -- no way that he should have approved Obamacare.\n\nNow, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.\n\nHEWITT: Ted Cruz, Senator, the chief justice got Hobby Lobby right, but what do you make of Mr. Cruz's criticism?\n\nCRUZ: Well, listen -- Donald knows that it was George W. Bush who appointed John Roberts. Yes, it's true, I supported the Republican nominee once he was made.\n\nBut I would not have nominated John Roberts.",

Look, I watched Ted -- and I respected it, but he gets nowhere -- stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk.\n\nI watched the other senators laughing and smiling.",

I will not apologize for defending the Bill of Rights.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd I find it amazing that your answer to Hugh and to the American people is, on religious liberty, you can't have one of the these crazy zealots that actually believes in it. You've got to be willing to cut a deal.\n\nAnd you know,",
      " there is a reason why, when Harry Reid was asked, of all the people on this stage, who does he want the most, who does he like the most, Harry Reid said Donald -- Donald Trump.\n\nWhy?

You have said that religious liberty will trump even the ability of people to stay away from same-sex marriages, not provide flowers, not provide baked goods, et cetera. Are you satisfied with this exchange on religious liberty?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I think you ask a very important question, because the issue here -- the next president of the United States has to fill this vacancy.\n\nJustice Scalia -- in the history of the republic, there has never been anyone better than him at standing for the principle that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document -- it is supposed to be applied as originally meant.\n\nAnd the next president of the United States has to be someone that you can trust and believe in to appoint someone just as good as Scalia -- plus there may be at least two other vacancies.\n\nSo you ask Mr.",
      " Trump to respond and say that he would, and he says that he would. But the bottom line is, if you look at his record over the last 25 or 30 years, on issue after issue, he has not been on our side.\n\nNow, if he's changed, we're always looking for converts into the conservative movement. But the bottom line is that, if (ph) you don't have a record there to look at and say, \"I feel at peace that when Donald Trump is president of the United States, he's going to be firmly on our side on these issues.\"\n\nIn fact, very recently, he was still defending Planned Parenthood.",
      " He says he's not going to take sides in the Palestinians versus Israel. These are concerning things.\n\nAnd so, yes, I have a doubt about whether Donald Trump, if he becomes president, will replace Justice Scalia with someone just like Justice Scalia.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Well, let -- let me just say -- let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative -- more importantly, he was a great president.",

Religious institutions should be able to practice the religion that they believe in. No question and no doubt about it.\n\nNow, in regard to same-sex marriage, I don't favor it. I've always favored traditional marriage,",

I first met him when we got an honorary degree together a long time ago. A tremendous wit and intellect.\n\nAs far as religious freedom is concerned, one of the basic tenets of this nation, and I believe that the Constitution protects all of our rights.

So, he says he is going to repeal Obamacare. Are you saying that you're worried he won't?\n\nRUBIO: The individual mandate.

      " That should not remain there. I think here's what we need to replace it with.\n\nWe need to repeal Obamacare completely and replace it with a system that puts Americans in charge of their health care money again. If your employer wants to buy health insurance for you, they can continue to do so from any company in America they want to buy it from.\n\nOtherwise, your employers can provide you health care money, tax- free, not treated as income, and you can use that money only for health care, but you can use it to fund health care any way you want, fully fund a health savings account, the combination of a health savings account or a private plan from any company in any state in the country.\n\nAnd if you don't have that,",
      " then you will have a refundable tax credit that provides you health care money to buy your own health care coverage. And that, I think, is a much better approach than Obamacare, which, by the way, isn't just bad for health care, it's bad for our economy. It is a health care law that is basically forcing companies to lay people off, cut people's hours, move people to part-time. It is not just a bad health care law, it is a job-killing law. And I will repeal it as president and we will replace it with something substantially better for all Americans.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH:",

We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition.\n\nTRUMP: We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window.\n\nThe reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people,",

They're suing that now to get that bailout money put back in.\n\nHere's what you didn't hear in that answer, and this is important guys, this is an important thing. What is your plan?

In 1994 when you were in Congress, you proposed a plan requiring an individual mandate. So what changed?\n\nKASICH:",
      " Well, Dana, the Heritage Foundation had this position as well. And when I look at it, I don't think it's tenable. And we don't need to do that. Again, I'm telling you that we are going to -- we have a proposal, a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices, below the midpoint -- some charge high, some charge low. If you are below the midpoint, we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess.\n\nThat is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare.",
      " Because if you think about your own deductibles today, they're going higher, higher and higher. And you know what? At some point, people can't afford it. Our plan will work. It uses the market. It uses transparency. It gets the patient in the middle. And guess what? We're actually doing it in my state, the seventh-largest state in the country. And if this will go -- this will go national, we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on. We will pay for quality, lower prices, and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in America and where people will also be able to have health insurance,",
      " even if they have a preexisting condition.\n\nWe don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance, Dana. So that's really what we're doing. This is not a theory. This is what we are actually doing in our state. We will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives. If our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year, with really high quality, guess what? They will get a financial reward.\n\nOur primary care physicians need help. They need support. We're losing them. This will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job.\n\nBASH:",
      " Governor Kasich, thank you.\n\nKASICH: Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Dr. Carson, you have dealt with the sickest of patients. You support covering preexisting conditions. How would you change Obamacare, but maintain that coverage?\n\nCARSON: Well, first of all, healthcare is not a right. But I do believe it is a responsibility for a responsible society, and we are that. We spend almost twice as much per capita on healthcare as many other nations who have actually much better access than we do.\n\nI propose a system in which we use health empowerment accounts, which are like a health savings account with no bureaucrats.",
      " And we give it to everybody from birth until death. They can pass it on when they die. We pay for it with the same dollars that we pay for traditional healthcare with. We give people the ability to shift money within their health empowerment account within their family. So dad's $500 short, mom can give it to him or a cousin or uncle.\n\nAnd it makes every family their own insurance carrier with no middle man. It gives you enormous flexibility. And also, you know, if Uncle Joe is smoking like a chimney, everybody's going to hide his cigarettes because they're all interested in what's going on there.\n\nAlso, the -- your catastrophic healthcare is going to cost a lot less money now because the only thing coming out of that is catastrophic healthcare.",
      " So, it's like a homeowners policy with a large deductible, versus a homeowners policy where you want every scratch covered. One costs $1,500 a year; one costs $10,000 a year. You can buy the $1,500 one. That will take care of 75 percent of the people. The people who are indigent, how do we take care of them now? Medicaid. What's the Medicaid budget? Almost $500 billion; almost 80 million people participate, which is way too many, and that will get a lot better when we fix the economy, which I hope we get a chance to talk about.\n\nCARSON:",
      " But do the math. Over $5,000 for each man, woman and child, and all -- they will have a lot more flexibility. What could you buy with that? A concierge practice.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nCARSON: And you could still have thousands of dollars left over. And let me just finish, because I don't get to talk that much. And, you know, let's...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... you can have the money that's left over to buy your catastrophic insurance. But most importantly, we give them a menu, just like we do in Medicare Part C, and they have the choices that will allow them not only to have catastrophic health care,",
      " but drug care and everything else.\n\nIt will be such a good program that nobody will want Obamacare after that, and that's probably the best way do it, although if anybody still did, I would still de-fund it.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you, Dr. Carson. Let's talk about the economy. Let's talk about...\n\nCRUZ: Wolf, Wolf, Wolf. Does everyone get to address Obamacare but me?\n\nBLITZER: I want to move on, but there'll be plenty of opportunities for you to address...\n\nCRUZ: It's kind of an issue I have a long history with.\n\nBLITZER:",
      " I know you do. And -- all right, go ahead.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCRUZ: Thank you, Wolf.\n\nKASICH: How do you -- how do you get that extra time, Cruz? You're very good at... CRUZ: You know, this is another issue on which Donald and I have sharp disagreements. On Planned Parenthood, he thinks Planned Parenthood is wonderful. I would instruct the Department of Justice to investigate them and prosecute any and all criminal violations.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nOn Obamacare, both Donald and I say we want to end it, but for very different reasons. I want to end it because it goes too far,",
      " it's killed millions of jobs, and it's hurting people's health care. Donald wants to end it because he says it doesn't go nearly far enough. And what was amazing in that exchange that was missing is for decades Donald has been advocating socialized medicine.\n\nWhat he's said is government should pay for everyone's health care, and in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said, if you don't support socialized health care, you're heartless. Now, liberal Democrats have been saying that for years. Now let me tell you if you're a small business owner, Donald Trump's socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care would kill more jobs than Obamacare,",
      " and if you're elderly, the results of socialized medicine in every country on earth where it's been implemented has been rationing, has been the government saying, no, you don't get that hip replacement, you don't get that knee replacement, the government is in charge of your health care.\n\nI'll tell you this. As president...\n\nBLITZER: Senator...\n\nCRUZ:... I will repeal every word of Obamacare.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, thank you. Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh,",
      " he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy.\n\nIn 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on. That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well.",
      " It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.\n\nCRUZ: Donald, true or false, you've said the government should pay for everyone's health care.\n\nTRUMP: That's false.\n\nCRUZ: You've never said that?\n\nTRUMP: No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...\n\nCRUZ: But you've never stood on this debate stage and says it works great in Canada and Scotland and we should do it here.\n\nTRUMP: No, I did not. No I did not.\n\nCRUZ: Did you say if you want people to die on the streets, if you don't support socialized health care,",
      " you have no heart.\n\nTRUMP: Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.\n\nCRUZ: Have you said you're a liberal on health care?\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...\n\nCRUZ: Talk away. Explain your plan, please.\n\nTRUMP: If people -- my plan is very simple.

Just answer the question.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.\n\nCRUZ: Who pays for it?\n\nRUBIO: Well, can I just clarify something?\n\nBLITZER: Gentleman, please.\n\nRUBIO: Wolf, no.",

      " All of you have agreed -- all of you have agreed to the rules. I want to move on. We're talking about the economy right now. Mr. Trump, you want to cut taxes more than President Ronald Reagan did, more than President George W. Bush did. The Independent Tax Foundation says the cost to the country of your proposal would be about $10 trillion, and that takes into account the economic growth that would emerge from your proposed tax cuts.\n\nHow would you cut $10 trillion over 10 years, but make sure the country isn't saddled with even more debt?\n\nTRUMP: Because the country will become a dynamic economy.",

We have the highest taxes in the world.\n\nIt's shutting off our economy. It's shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.\n\nBLITZER: What specific cuts will you make to pay for that tax cut?\n\nTRUMP: We're going to make many cuts in business.

Waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou look at what's happening with Social Security, you look -- look at what's happening with every agency -- waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.\n\nBLITZER: Governor Kasich.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen you were in Congress, you were chairman of the Budget Committee. You helped craft the last balanced budget the United States had.",
      " Can Mr. Trump's plan work?\n\nKASICH: Well, I think it takes three things, Wolf. And I've done it. I mean, I -- we got the budget balanced. We cut the capital gains tax. You see, in order to get this economy moving again, you have to grow the economy, and you have to restrain the spending.\n\nAnd when I was chairman, we cut that capital gains tax and we instituted a significant program to get to balance. We had a balanced budget four years in a row, had to take on every interest group in Washington -- every single one of them -- and we paid down a half a trillion of the national debt.\n\nAnd why do you do it?",
      " Because you want job growth. If you don't have regulatory reform, common-sense regulations, reasonable tax cuts, which I have, and a fiscal plan, you won't get there. You will never be able to do it.\n\nNow, I -- I inherited an an $8 billion hole in Ohio, I have common-sense regulations, I have tax cuts -- the biggest of any governor in the country -- and we have a fiscal plan.\n\nAnd it's not all -- it's not always cutting. It's innovating -- it's producing a better product at, frankly, a lower price. Now we have a $2 billion surplus.",

No one could even believe it happened.\n\n(BELL RINGS)\n\nI've done it in Ohio, we're growing, the jobs are up and people are having opportunity.

So do I. But of the over 400,000 jobs that we've created in the state,",

Are any of those accusations that he has leveled true?\n\nTRUMP:",
      " All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form -- almost 100 pages. You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements.\n\nTRUMP: I filed -- which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to.\n\nSo as far as that's concerned,",
      " I filed it. And that's where you find out what kind of a company. You don't learn anything from a tax return.\n\nI will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league.\n\nAs far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me,",
      " audit me, audit me.\n\nNobody gets audited -- I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year.

I've had it for years, I get audited.\n\nAnd obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.\n\nHEWITT: So, Senator Rubio, Mitt Romney also called upon to you release your tax returns.

And luckily I'm not being audited this year, or last year, for that matter.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRUBIO: But this is my time. I want to go back to this question you asked about the debt. This is an important issue. It's a huge issue, OK? In less than five years, 83 percent of our entire budget will be made up of Social Security,",
      " Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the debt.\n\nThat means only 17 percent of our budget will be for things like the military or the Department of Education or environmental protection issues.\n\nYou cannot balance our budget unless you deal with that 83 percent, which is why I've been repeatedly talking about since my time running for the Senate in Florida, where there are a lot of people like my mother that depend on Social Security and Medicare, on the need to save those programs, by reforming the way they work for future generations.\n\nAnd I think if we -- the longer we take to do this, the closer we are going to get to a debt crisis.",
      " And, Wolf, you did not get an answer to your question. This debt issue is -- the next president of the United States will not be able to serve four to eight years without dealing with the national debt.\n\nIt is not a question of if, it is a question of when we have a debt crisis. And we should not leave the stage here tonight without hearing a serious answer from every single one of us about how we are going to deal bring the national debt under control once and for all.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you, Senator Rubio.

And I would note that this question really goes -- you know, Donald says he's being audited.\n\nWell, I would think that would underscore the need to release those returns. If he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent, the voters need to know.\n\nAnd listen, people across this country, we recognize our country is in crisis.

I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel.\n\nAs president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally.",
      " And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy.\n\nNow, I may not be successful in doing it. It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn't help if I start saying, \"I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage.\" But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors.\n\nAnd I can't do that as well -- as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big,",
      " big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.\n\nBLITZER: Senator Cruz?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Well, this is another area on which Donald agrees with Hillary Clinton and on which I disagree with them both strongly. Both Donald and Hillary Clinton want to be neutral, to use Donald's word, between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nLet me be clear. If I'm president, America will stand unapologetically with the nation of Israel.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd the notion of neutrality is based upon the left buying into this moral relativism that is often pitched in the media. Listen, it is not equivalent.",
      " When you have terrorist strapping dynamite around their chest, exploding and murdering innocent women and children, they are not equivalent to the IDF officers protecting Israel. And I will not pretend that they are.\n\nJust today, Iran announced they're going to pay $7,000 to each suicide bomber. And I would note, missing from Donald's answer was anything he has done in his nearly 70 years of living defending Israel. I have over and over again led the fight to defend Israel, to fight for Israel. And this -- if you want to know who will stand with Israel, we ought to start with who has stood with Israel when the heat was on.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER:",
      " Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I can only say -- look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I'm going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.\n\nBLITZER: Governor Kasich, I want you to weigh in.\n\nKASICH: Well, I mean, well, I was in Congress for 18 years on the Defense Committee.",
      " And then, you know, after 9/11, the secretary of defense called me in to help out with some things. And I've been a supporter of Israel -- a strong supporter of Israel longer than anybody on this stage. I didn't give as much money as Donald gave, but I've been standing with the Israelis for a very long time.\n\nAnd frankly, I think the problem we have in foreign policy right now, Wolf, is that we are not certain with who we stand with. Our allies are not sure what to make of us, and our enemies are moving. And one -- are moving because they're not sure what we will do.\n\nIt's a very interesting development here within the 24 hours.",
      " We said to the South Koreans that we would give them the high altitude defense system. It really rattled the Chinese, and for the first time since we took positive action, the Chinese are beginning to take action against North Korea.\n\nWhen we stand firm and we let the world know who we're with, who we stand for, and we bring our allies together, that is the road forward.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: We're going to get to North Korea in a moment. But Senator Rubio, what's wrong with the U.S. being an honest broker in a negotiation, as Mr. Trump is proposing?\n\nRUBIO:",
      " Because -- and I don't know if Donald realizes this. I'm sure it's not his intent perhaps. But the position you've taken is an anti-Israel position. And here's why. Because you cannot be an honest broker in a dispute between two sides in which one of the sides is constantly acting in bad faith. The Palestinian Authority has walked away from multiple efforts to make peace, very generous offers from the Israels. Instead, here's what the Palestinians do. They teach their four- year-old children that killing Jews is a glorious thing. Here's what Hamas does. They launch rockets and terrorist attacks again Israel on an ongoing basis.",
      " The bottom line is, a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, given the current makeup of the Palestinians, is not possible.\n\nAnd so the next president of the United States needs to be someone like me who will stand firmly on the side of Israel. I'm not -- I'm not going to sit here and say, \"Oh, I'm not on either side.\" I will be on a side. I will be on Israel's side every single day because they are the only pro-American, free enterprise democracy in the entire Middle East.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Trump?\n\nTRUMP: I'm a negotiator.",
      " I've done very well over the years through negotiation. It's very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. He's not going down -- excuse me...\n\nRUBIO: He thinks a Palestinian is a real estate deal.\n\nTRUMP:... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?\n\nRUBIO: The Palestinians are not a real estate deal, Donald.\n\nTRUMP: OK, no, no, no -- a deal is a deal.",
      " Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.\n\nRUBIO: A deal is not a deal when you're dealing with terrorists. Have you ever negotiated with terrorists?\n\nTRUMP: You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...\n\nRUBIO:... Donald, might be able to (inaudible) Palestinians and Arabs, but it's not a real estate deal...\n\nTRUMP:... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...\n\nBLITZER:",
      "... Senator.\n\nTRUMP: He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.\n\nBLITZER: Let's move on to talk about North Korea. You raised it, Governor Kasich. The threat posed by North Korea to the United States and its sallies, the commander of American forces in South Korea said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would use a weapon of mass destruction if he thought his regime was being threatened. You have said the United States should start examining a strategy of regime change in North Korea.\n\nLet's be clear.",
      " Are you talking about getting rid of Kim Jong Un?\n\nKASICH: When you talk about regime change, Wolf, it means regime change. That's what it means. Even though there's so much chaos in North Korea right now, there's a lot of reports of uncertainty, and instability in that government.\n\nBut, look, here's what I think we ought to do -- like, immediately. And, we've been kicking the can down the road on this for, I don't know, 15 years. We should be intercepting the ships that are leaving North Korea so they're not selling this material, or this technology,",
      " or giving it to someone else.\n\nSecondly, the same goes with the aircraft.\n\nThirdly, we need to slap even tougher sanctions on North Korea because we really don't have the toughest sanctions on North Korea. We ought to talk about arming South Korea with ballistic missile technology. And, of course, also Japan with ballistic missile technology. Because we're now starting to take a firm position. We have the attention of the Chinese. The Chinese are the best way to calm that regime down and get them in a position of where they back off.\n\nBut, when I say regime change, I don't have to talk exactly what that means.",
      " Look, I've been involved in national security for a long time. You don't have to spell everything out, but what I'm telling you is you look for any means you can to be able to solve that problem in North Korea, and in the meantime put the pressure on the Chinese. And, what we're doing is beginning to work against them.\n\nThey are the key to being able to settle this situation.\n\nBLITZER: I just want to be precise, Governor Kasich, this is critically important. There are a million North Korean troops North of the DMZ...\n\nKASICH:... I'm very well aware of that.\n\nBLITZER:",
      " A million South Korean troops, 28,000 U.S. troops along the DMZ, right in between. Would you risk war for a regime change?\n\nKASICH: Wolf, again, it would depend exactly what, you know, what was happening. What the situation was. But, if there was an opportunity to remove the leader of North Korea and create stability? Because, I'll tell you, you keep kicking the can down the road we're going to face this sooner or later.\n\nBut, in the meantime, I'm also aware of the fact that there's 10 million people living in Seoul. So, you don't just run around making charges.",
      " I have put it on the table that I would leave to see regime change in North Korea.\n\nNow, perhaps the Chinese can actually accomplish that with this man who is now currently the leader, but the fact is we have to bring everything to bear. We have to be firm, and we've got to unite those people in that part of the world to stand firmly against North Korea, and make sure we have the ballistic...\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nKASICH:... ballistic missile technology to defend ourselves.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying,",
      " I think that we are now in a position -- are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea.\n\nYou order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries. Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit. They're coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty.",
      " They were making $1 billion dollars a day.\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nWe defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: Hey, Wolf, Wolf...\n\nBLITZER: Dr. Carson.\n\nKASICH: Hey, Wolf, let me just say this because he mentioned this. Look, we're all in agreement that the Japanese need to do more. We're all in agreement that the Europeans need to do more, but I hate to just tell everybody we are the leader of the world and we should put the pressure on them to do their job.",
      " There is no question about it.\n\nBut, at the same time, we also have to rebuild the military. Look, I have a balanced budget plan that cuts taxes, reforms regulations, but also builds the military, puts a $100 billion dollars more in defense. We need to rebuild our defenses,\n\nBut, I must also tell you, a long time reformer of the Pentagon, we must reform that building.\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nWe can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. We have 800,000 bureaucrats working for DOD, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...\n\nBLITZER:",
      "... Thank you...\n\nKASICH:... these resources into strengthening the military. So, we can do it all...\n\nBLITZER: Dr. Carson, how would you deal with North Korea?\n\nCARSON: OK. Well first of all, people say that I whine a lot because I don't get time. I'm going to whine because I didn't get asked about taxes, I didn't get asked about Israel. Hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes. I had something to say about that.\n\nNow...\n\nBLITZER: Go ahead. This is your moment.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCARSON:",
      " OK. We have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. You know, I never had an audit until I spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. And then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year. And they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year. They didn't find anything and they won't find anything because I'm a very honest person.\n\nBut he fact of the matter is the IRS is not honest and we need to get rid of them.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd as far as Israel is concerned,",
      " you know, when I was there several months ago, I talked to a lot of people. I couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on Israel. You know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a Judeo Christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject Israel. It doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. We can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.\n\nAnd now,",
      " as far as North Korea is concerned, you know, Kim Jung Un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. And I think we have to present strength to him. We should be encouraging the alliance with Japan and South Korea. We should be encouraging the placement of the THAAD, the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, that seems to disturb not only the North Koreans but the Chinese as well.\n\nAnd we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and I think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities.",
      " We need to be able to defend ourselves. And lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Thank you. We're going to continue with national security. Go ahead, Hugh.\n\nHEWITT: Thank you, Wolf. Mr. Trump, we are less than 24 hours away from a ceasefire in Syria that has been brokered between the U.S. and Russia. Do you support this ceasefire?\n\nTRUMP: I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing.",
      " So It's a meaningless ceasefire.\n\nI love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of -- with a total cessation. But it's not working, as you know very well. It's not working. If -- we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it.\n\nSo I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.\n\nHEWITT: Senator Cruz, your opinion on the ceasefire.\n\nCRUZ: Well look. We're certainly hopeful that the violence will cease, but there's reason to be highly skeptical. Russia has enhanced its position because of Obama's weakness in the Middle East,",
      " weakness in Syria. And you know, as we're headed to November, we need no nominate a Republican candidate that can lay out a clear difference with both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy.\n\nOne of the real challenges with both Donald and Senator Rubio is that they have agreed over and over again with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. So for example, in Libya, both of them agreed with the Obama/Clinton policy of toppling the government in Libya. That was a disaster. It gave the country over to radical Islamic terrorism and it endangered America.\n\nAnother example is John Kerry. John Kerry -- Senator Rubio voted to confirm John Kerry as secretary of State.",
      " I voted against him. And Donald Trump supported John Kerry against George W. Bush in 2004, gave him a check. And John Kerry has been the most anti-Israel secretary of State this country has ever seen. His diplomacy has been a disaster. And if we nominate someone who agreed with John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton on foreign policy, we're not in a strong position to win the general election.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT: A response, Mr. Trump, then Mr. Rubio.\n\nTRUMP: Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much.",
      " But the fact is that...\n\nCRUZ: But you called for Bush to be impeached.\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned. You know it and so do I.\n\nCRUZ: But you gave him a check and called for him to be impeached.\n\nTRUMP: Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early.\n\nTRUMP: But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya?",
      " We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now.\n\nIf these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be -- at least they killed terrorists, all right?\n\nAnd I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting. You look at Libya right now, ISIS, as we speak, is taking over their oil. As we speak, it's a total mess.\n\nWe would have been better off if the politicians took a day off instead of going into war.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nHEWITT:",
      " Senator Rubio.\n\nRUBIO: Yes, a couple of points. Number one, on the Libya situation, we didn't topple Gadhafi, the Libyan people toppled Gadhafi. The only choice before America that this president had to make is, does it happen quickly or does it take a long time?\n\nAnd I argued if it takes a long time, you're going to have rebel forces emerge like these radical Islamists to take advantage of the vacuum. And that's what happened. That's where the term \"lead from behind\" came. And that's the foreign policy that apparently Senator Cruz appears to agree with.\n\nOn John Kerry,",
      " yes, you know why, because every day John Kerry wasn't appointed was another day Hillary Clinton was still in charge of the State Department. And she was absolutely horrible.\n\nI couldn't imagine that they were going to find somebody even worse than her, but this president never ceases to amaze.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: And the last point I would make on South Korea, now this is important, because we're asking to be commander-in-chief. Donald is asking to be commander-in-chief. And he's saying these guys need to do more.\n\nSouth Korea contributes $800 million a year to that effort.",
      " And Japan contributes as well. And here's why our commitment to that regional security is so critical, Donald, because if we walk away from them, both Japan and South Korea will become nuclear weapons powers.\n\nThey can do that very quickly. And that's what they will do if the American defense agreements wither away, which is why we have to rebuild the military, but why we can't walk away from our Asia-Pacific defense status.\n\nHEWITT: Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: I never said walk away. I wouldn't want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...\n\nRUBIO:",
      " How much?\n\nTRUMP: A lot. I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get.\n\nAs far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place.\n\nIt is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel. I'm no fan of John Kerry.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBLITZER: Hold on, hold on, Governor.\n\nSenator Cruz.\n\nCRUZ:",
      " You know, it's interesting, Donald just said that he never came out in favor of toppling Gadhafi in Libya. Well, he stated that in an interview that will be on our Web site, tedcruz.org.\n\nYou can see and hear the exact words from Donald's mouth. And I assume when he sees that interview, maybe he forgot about it, but I assume Donald will apologize where he sees that he said exactly that.\n\nWith regard to John Kerry, I will say John Kerry's foreign policy has been a disaster for decades. That's why I voted against him when he came up. And the fact that Donald Trump would write him a check and support him against George W.",
      " Bush shows exceptionally poor foreign policy judgment.\n\nAnd I'll give one more example on Israel. When the Obama administration canceled civilian air flights into the national of Israel, when Hamas was raining rockets down on them, I publicly asked, is this an economic boycott against Israel?\n\nThe next day Michael Bloomberg, another New York billionaire, got on a plane, a commercial flight, and flew to Israel from London. Together the heat and light that was put on the State Department was so great that within 36 hours they lifted the ban on air flights into Israel.\n\nDuring that entire battle, and indeed during every battle on Israel the natural question is, where was Donald?",
      " If this is something he cares about, why has he supported anti-Israel politicians from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry for four decades?\n\nIf you care about Israel, you don't write checks to politicians who are undermining Israel.

      " There's a huge battle underway right now between the tech giant Apple and the federal government. The federal government wants Apple to unlock the phone used by that San Bernardino terrorist to prevent future attacks. Apple has refused, saying it would compromise the security of all of its customers. And just this afternoon, they went to court to block the judge's order.\n\nDana Bash, pick up the questioning.\n\nBASH: Senator Rubio, you say it's complicated, and that, quote, \"Apple isn't necessarily wrong to refuse the court order.\" Why shouldn't investigators have everything at their disposal?\n\nRUBIO: No, in fact what I have said is the only thing -- the FBI made this very clear 48 hours ago -- the only thing they are asking of Apple is that Apple allow them to use their own systems in the FBI to try to guess the password of the San Bernardino killer.",
      " Apple initially came out saying, \"We're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device.\" That is not accurate.\n\nThe only thing they're being asked to do, and the FBI made this very clear about 48 hours ago, is allow us to disable the self- destruct mode that's in the Apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was.\n\nAnd I think they should comply with that. If that's all they're asking for, they are not asking for Apple to create a back door to encryption.\n\nBASH: So just to be clear, you did say on CNN a couple of weeks ago this is a complicated issue;",
      " Apple is not necessarily wrong here.\n\nRUBIO: Because at the time, Apple was portraying that the court order was to create a back door to an encryption device.\n\nBASH: But just to be clear -- just to be clear, if you are president, would you instruct your Justice Department to force Apple to comply or not?\n\nRUBIO: To comply with an order that says that they have to allow the FBI the opportunity to try to guess the password?\n\nBASH: Correct.\n\nRUBIO: Absolutely. That Apple phone didn't even belong to the killer. It belonged to the killer's employee (sic) who have agreed to allow him to try to do this.",
      " That is all they're asking them to do is to disable the self-destruct mode or the auto-erase mode on one phone in the entire world. But Apple doesn't want to do it because they think it hurts their brand.\n\nWell, let me tell you, their brand is not superior to the national security of the United States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Senator Cruz, Apple CEO Tim Cook says this would be bad for America. Where do you stand: national security or personal privacy?\n\nCRUZ: Well, as you know, at that same CNN forum, both Marco and I were asked this question. His answer, he was on both sides of the fence.",
      " He's now agreeing with me. And so I'm glad.\n\nWhat I said is yes, Apple should be forced to comply with this court order. Why? Because under the Fourth Amendment, a search and seizure is reasonable if it has judicial authorization and probable cause. In this instance, the order is not put a back door in everyone's cell phone. If that was the order, that order would be problematic because it would compromise security and safety for everyone.\n\nI would agree with Apple on that broad policy question. But on the question of unlocking this cell phone of a terrorist, we should enforce the court order and find out everyone that terrorist at San Bernardino talked to on the phone,",
      " texted with, e-mailed. And absolutely, Apple doesn't have a right to defy a valid court order in a terrorism investigation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBASH: Dr. Carson, Tim Cook, again, the CEO of Apple, says that this would be bad for America. What do you think?\n\nCARSON: I think allowing terrorist to get away with things is bad for America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou know, we have the -- we have a Constitution. We have a Fourth Amendment. It guards us against illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. But we have mechanisms in place with the judicial system that will allow us to gain material that is necessary to benefit the nation as a whole or the community as a whole.",
      " And that's why we have FISA courts and things of that nature.\n\nSo absolutely, I would -- I would expect Apple to comply with the court order. If they don't comply with that, you're encouraging chaos in our system.\n\nBASH: Mr. Trump...\n\n(APPLAUSE) KASICH: I want to weigh in on this please. I want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and Apple. You know what the problem is? Where's the president been? You sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out. You don't litigate this on the front page of the New York Times,",
      " where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here.\n\nThe president of the United States should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with Apple and our security forces. And then you know what you do when you're the president? You lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of Americans. This is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.\n\nAnd I'll tell you, that's why you want a governor. I do this all the time. And we reach agreements all the time.",
      " Because as an executive, you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper.\n\nARRASAS: Thank you, Governor.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: Thank you.\n\nARRARAS: Mr. Trump, you have been very vocal about securing the Mexican border, but ISIS has called upon its supporters to conduct attacks on our neighbor to the North, Canada.\n\nAs a matter of fact, U.S. officials have warned that it is the Canadian border which is the most significant threat. You have said that you will not build a wall in Canada. When it comes to national security, and the threat of terrorism,",
      " why does Mexico need a wall, and Canada doesn't? Isn't that, like, closing the front door, and leaving the back door open?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer. You're talking about a massive border.\n\nWe have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts -- you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire.\n\nYou go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place -- it's beautiful.",
      " With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it.\n\nThey're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security. I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget. It'll be a very high wall, a great wall. It's going to be built, it's going to be built. It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way -- maybe I'll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico.\n\nThe problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece.",
      " You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we -- it is not our biggest problem. I don't care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nARRARAS: I want to talk to you, Senator Rubio, about Puerto Rico. As you know, Puerto Rico's in the midst of financial collapse, unable to pay it's debt of $72 billion dollars. Puerto Rico is asking for bankruptcy protection which would give Puerto Rico,",
      " and Puerto Ricans, which are U.S. citizens, you know that -- the tools to restructure the debt. That is the same debt the other 50 states have.\n\nYou oppose granting Puerto Rico that bankruptcy protection. You say that it is only a last resort measure, but the government of Puerto Rico has said that bankruptcy is it's last resort. That that's where they are now. How do you explain this very strong stance to the hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans that vote across the U.S., and particularly in your state of Florida?\n\nRUBIO: Sure, because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating,",
      " or you're going to be bankrupt again. And, the problem with Puerto Rico is it's economy is not growing. It has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of Florida, and all over the country.\n\nThey're coming to the mainland from Puerto Rico because the economy there is not growing, it's too expensive to do business there. The tax rate is too high. The government regulations are too extensive.\n\nThis year alone, with all the problems they're having, they barely cut their budget from one year to the next. So, I think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again.",
      " If the economy of Puerto Rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt, or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments.\n\nSo, yes, if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection, but not as the first resort, which is what they're asking for, because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place, and coming to the mainland.\n\nThey're United States citizens, they're obviously entitled to do so,",
      " and we welcome them, but we would also prefer to see a Puerto Rico that once again is growing economically, and is robust. And, the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job.\n\nTheir previous governor, Louis Fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to...\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nRUBIO:... to someone who has taken a big government stance (ph) once again...\n\nBLITZER:... Senator, thank you very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: I want our viewers to stay with us right now, including the last pitch in the final debate before Super Tuesday.\n\n(APPLAUSE)",
      " (CHEERING)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Welcome back to the University of Houston. It's time now for closing statements. All of you will have 30 seconds. Dr. Carson, we'll start with you.\n\nCARSON: Well first of all, I want people to think about what kind of leader do you want and what kind of person do you want your kids to emulate. Think about that.\n\nSecondly, several years ago, a movie was made about these hands. These hands by the grace of God have saved many lives and healed many families. And I'm asking you tonight,",
      " America, to join hands with me to heal, inspire and revive America. If not us, who? And if not now, when?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Governor Kasich.\n\nKASICH: Well, the last USA Today poll had me beating Hillary Clinton by 11 points, more than anybody on this stage. Secondly, I hope you saw tonight that executive experience really matters. It matters in terms of growing our economy, balancing budgets, cutting taxes, reforming regulations. I've done it in Washington, I've done it in Ohio, and I can go back to Washington and do it again.\n\nBut I hope you also noticed tonight that I do have the foreign policy experience,",
      " not just a few years, but a lot of years in working with some of the great, great minds in this country to develop the expertise, the confidence, the firmness, the toughness and the ability to bring people together.\n\nI hope you all think about giving me your vote. I would appreciate it very much. And I tell you, we won't have to spend time figuring what we're going to do. I will hit the ground running and we will get America moving again. Thank you all very much.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: Well, thank you for having us tonight.",
      " You know, this campaign has come a long way. It was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count. And we have an incredible decision to make, not just about the direction of America, but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement.\n\nRUBIO: The time for games is over.\n\nI know you've had a lot of choices to make, but now it's time to narrow it down. And I'm asking you to get behind me, go on our Web site and join you our effort, marcorubio.com,",
      " so we can bring an end to this silliness, this looniness, and once again re-embrace all the things that made America and the Republican Party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Senator Cruz.\n\nCRUZ: Washington deals are bankrupting this country. There are several deal-makers on this stage but there is only one person who has consistently stood up to both parties, fighting for the American people against the Washington deals.\n\nIf I'm elected president, on the first day in office I will rescind every single illegal and unconstitutional executive action. I will instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any criminal violations.\n\nI will instruct every federal agency that the persecution of religious liberty ends today.",
      " I will rip to shreds the Iranian -- catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. And I will begin the process of moving the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\n\nWe will repeal Obamacare, abolish of IRS, secure the border, and bring back jobs.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you.\n\nNobody knows politicians better than I do. They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done. I've watched it for years. Take a look at what's happening to our country.\n\nAll of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military,",
      " whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Trump, thank you.\n\nAnd thanks to each of the candidates, on behalf of everyone here at CNN and Telemundo. We also want to thank the Republican National Committee and the University of Houston. My thanks also to Hugh Hewitt, Maria Celeste, and Dana Bash.\n\nSuper Tuesday is only five days away.",
      " THE CONTENDERS | Between 8:45 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. Thursday night, Marco Rubio learned how to box.\n\nIn the first few minutes, after Wolf Blitzer rang the bell to start the fight at the GOP debate in Houston, Rubio threw punch after punch after punch at Donald Trump, barely letting one land before he moved on to the next one. Campaigns put together portfolios of attacks that plan to use, called \u201coppo books.\u201d Marco Rubio pulled every sheet out of that book and then tossed the empty cover at Trump, too, for good measure.\n\nThat was nerves. Less than an hour later,",
      " Rubio was landing strategic, gleeful blows, and Trump was flustered. Rubio\u2019s best line was the one about how if Trump hadn\u2019t gotten an inheritance, he\u2019d be selling watches. But the one that grated on Trump the most was when he noted Trump\u2019s habit of repeating himself. Over that hour, it was like Rubio leveled up.\n\nDuring that first flurry, it was clear which point Rubio thought would be the most effective. He repeatedly told viewers to Google \u201cTrump Polish workers\u201d or \u201cDonald Trump Polish workers,\u201d so that people would read the details of a suit filed against the developer involving the construction of Trump Tower. That suit,",
      " which was eventually settled, accused Trump of knowingly employing and abusing illegal Polish immigrants to work on building the structure.\n\nPeople went to Google. But what they were searching for was one of the other little punches Marco Rubio tossed into the mix: Trump University.\n\nYou can see the spike on the Google search chart here. It came during that first fight.\n\nBut you can see it more clearly below. When Ted Cruz mentioned it later in the debate \u2014 more clearly landing his blows \u2014 searches spiked even higher.\n\n(The Polish workers didn\u2019t move the needle at all.)\n\nThe issue at hand is a lawsuit filed against Trump in regard to a \u201cuniversity\u201d that carried his name.",
      " The Post\u2019s Emma Brown covered the story last year. Brown wrote:\n\nNever licensed as a school, Trump University was in reality a series of real estate workshops in hotel ballrooms around the country, not unlike many other for-profit self-help or motivational seminars. Though short-lived, it remains a thorn in Trump\u2019s side nearly five years after its operations ceased: In three pending lawsuits, including one in which the New York attorney general is seeking $40 million in restitution, former students allege that the enterprise bilked them out of their money with misleading advertisements.\n\nAs Cruz noted, Trump may be a witness when the case comes to court later this year.\n\nRubio\u2019s initial flurry was rushed and anxious,",
      " but it appears to have been a spaghetti-on-the-wall moment. What stuck? Trump University.\n"

If your broker holds your shares in its name and you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will only have discretion to vote your shares on \"routine\"",

All other proposals are considered \"non-routine,\" and your broker will not have discretion to vote on these proposals.\n\nBroker non-votes and abstentions by stockholders from voting (including brokers holding their clients' shares of record who cause abstentions to be recorded) will be counted towards determining whether or not a quorum is present.",

Compensia provided the compensation & governance committee with an analysis of total cash compensation data (base salaries and cash bonus awards at target) and total compensation data (total cash compensation and equity compensation) at various percentiles.

Historically, our executive officers have received base salaries within a narrow range that was established when we were a smaller company with cash constraints, and based on our desire to maintain internal pay equity between our executive officers and also relative to other key employees. As we have grown, we have increased base salaries for our executive officers (other than our CEO), although we still deliver the substantial majority of compensation to our executive officers in the form of equity awards.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2017, the compensation & governance committee decided to increase the base salaries of our named executive officers, other than our CEO,",
      " in order to continue to bring their salaries closer to those paid to executives holding similar positions at the companies in our Peer Group. Accordingly, our compensation & governance committee increased the base salaries of our named executive officers as shown in the table below. Following these 2017 salary increases, these named executive officer salaries fell between the 25th and 50th percentiles of the salaries provided to executives holding similar positions at the companies in our Peer Group. Previously, Mr. Zuckerberg had requested to receive a base salary of $1 per year and the compensation & governance committee continued to honor this request in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamed Executive Officer 2016 Base Salary ($) 2017 Base Salary Increase ($) 2017 Base Salary ($) Mark Zuckerberg 1\n\n\u2014\n\n1\n\nSheryl K.",

Our 2017 Bonus Plan (Bonus Plan) provides variable cash incentives, payable semi-annually, that are designed to motivate our executive officers to focus on company-wide priorities and to reward them for individual results and achievements. In 2017, the individual target bonus percentage for each named executive officer was unchanged from 2016 at 75%",
      " of such executive's base salary. After the 2017 base salary increases noted above, target total cash compensation (base salary plus target bonus) for our named executive officers (other than our CEO) approximated the 25th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions at the companies in our Peer Group. All of our named executive officers, except our CEO, participated in the Bonus Plan in 2017.\n\nFor 2017, there were two six-month performance periods under our Bonus Plan, which we refer to as First Half 2017 and Second Half 2017. For each performance period in 2017,",
      " the compensation & governance committee approved a set of company-wide priorities in order to focus our executive officers on key areas of performance for the period in question. The First Half 2017 and Second Half 2017 company priorities reflect operational and non-operational objectives established by our compensation & governance committee, in consultation with our CEO and CFO. The company-wide priorities did not have specific target levels associated with them for purposes of determining performance under the Bonus Plan, and our compensation & governance committee had full discretion to determine the level of bonus payout for each performance period.\n\n2017 Priorities and Company Performance Percentage. Our First Half 2017 and Second Half 2017 company-wide priorities as approved by the compensation & governance committee were as follows:",
      " grow our user base across all our products; increase sharing, engagement, and utility; continue to achieve revenue growth and significant savings from efficiency; improve product quality; improve our brand; and make progress toward our long-term investments. None of these priorities were assigned any specific weighting or dollar amount of the target bonus. The compensation & governance committee exercised its discretion in determining the company performance percentage for our First Half 2017 and Second Half 2017 performance after taking into account our delivery of results in the areas identified by the company-wide priorities, as well as our overall business, engineering, and product development achievements.\n\nThe First Half 2017 company performance percentage approved by the compensation & governance committee was 100%. In making this determination,",
      " the compensation & governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company-wide priorities, in particular the progress toward long-term investments.\n\nThe Second Half 2017 company performance percentage approved by the compensation & governance committee was 90%. In making this determination, the compensation & governance committee focused on our performance across all of the areas identified by the company-wide priorities, with a particular focus on revenue, user growth and engagement, and progress on the company's long-term investments.\n\nBonus Plan Payouts. We calculate Bonus Plan payouts to each participant using the following formula:\n\nBase Eligible Earnings ($) x Individual Bonus Target Percentage (%) x Individual Performance Percentage (%) x Company Performance Percentage (%) = Individual Bonus Payout ($)\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual Performance Percentage.",
      " The individual performance percentage is based upon each executive officer's individual performance assessment for the performance period under consideration. Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, a higher performance assessment results in a higher individual performance percentage (and vice-versa) such that it is possible for an executive with a low assessment to get less than their target bonus payout, or no bonus payout whatsoever. In 2017, potential individual performance percentages under our Bonus Plan were 0%, 85%, 100%, 125%, 200%,\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor 300%. An executive officer meeting our expected high level of performance expectations would receive an individual performance percentage of 100%.\n\nIndividual performance assessments for each named executive officer were determined in the discretion of the compensation & governance committee following discussions with our CEO and our COO (except in the case of our COO when her individual performance assessment was being determined). The performance assessment determinations were based on an overall subjective assessment of each executive officer's performance and no single factor was determinative in setting bonus payout levels,",
      " nor was the impact of any individual factor on the bonus quantifiable. We operate in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry and we set a high bar for performance expectations for each one of our named executive officers. The compensation & governance committee evaluates our named executive officers based on their overall performance, impact, and results, as well as their demonstration of strong leadership, long-term vision, effective execution, and management capabilities. First Half 2017 and Second Half 2017 payout levels and achievements and considerations for each named executive officer were as follows:\n\nMark Zuckerberg.

      " Most of our executive officers' target total direct compensation is delivered through equity awards. We use equity compensation to align our executive officers' financial interests with those of our stockholders, to attract industry leaders of the highest caliber, and to retain them for the long term. In addition to the initial equity award that each executive officer receives as part of his or her new hire package, the compensation & governance committee typically grants our executive officers additional equity awards each year as part of our company-wide equity refresher program. Additional equity awards for each of our executive officers are determined on a discretionary basis taking into account the following factors:\n\n\u2022 delivering equity values that are highly competitive when compared against those granted to executives with similar responsibilities at the companies in our Peer Group that have higher revenue and market capitalization when compared to other companies in our Peer Group;\n\n\u2022 each executive officer's individual performance assessment,",
      " the results and contributions delivered during the year, as well as the anticipated potential future impact of each individual executive;\n\n\u2022 the size and vesting schedule of existing equity awards in order to maximize the long-term retentive power of all additional awards; and\n\n\u2022 the size of each executive officer's target total cash compensation (base salary plus cash bonus awards at target), which is generally lower than the cash compensation for executives with similar responsibilities at the companies in our Peer Group.\n\nBased on the foregoing factors, in 2017, our compensation & governance committee granted each of our executive officers, other than our CEO, an award of RSUs with a specific \"initial equity value\"",
      " based on an estimated total value for each award before taking into account the deferred vesting considerations described below. The compensation & governance committee calculated the number of RSUs to be granted by dividing this initial equity value by $132.61 per share, which was the average closing price for the seven trading days following the announcement of our earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the same price that was used for 2017 refresher awards to all other employees.\n\nVesting of 2017 RSU Awards. Due to our desire to provide incentives for our named executive officers to focus on long-term strategic and financial objectives, the compensation & governance committee deferred the vesting start dates of some 2017 RSU awards made to our named executive officers to a future date determined individually for each executive.",
      " As a result, the 2017 RSU awards generally will not begin to vest unless the recipient remains continuously employed by the company through future dates as described in the following paragraphs and in \"\u2014 2017 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table\" below.\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compensation & governance committee reviewed the size and vesting schedule for the remaining unvested portion of the outstanding equity awards held by each of our named executive officers and agreed with the recommendation of our CEO and COO (except that our COO did not participate in discussions regarding her own equity compensation) that the existing equity awards appropriately satisfied our retention and incentive goals for the immediate future for each of our named executive officers,",
      " other than our CFO. Accordingly, the additional equity awards granted to our named executive officers in 2017, other than our CFO, start vesting only after a significant portion of each executive's outstanding equity awards have vested. The 2017 RSU awards will vest quarterly over four years following the vesting start dates as described in \"\u2014 2017 Equity Awards\" below. The compensation & governance committee believes that these deferred vesting schedules make the equity awards more valuable to us in retaining our named executive officers and reflect our emphasis on our long-term success.

      " Chairman, and CEO. We require these security measures for the company's benefit because of the importance of Mr. Zuckerberg to Facebook, and we believe that the costs of this overall security program are appropriate and necessary. We paid for the initial procurement, installation, and maintenance of security measures for Mr. Zuckerberg's personal residences, and we pay for the annual costs of security personnel. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg uses private aircraft for personal travel in connection with his overall security program. On certain occasions, Mr. Zuckerberg may be accompanied by guests when using private aircraft. Although we do not consider Mr. Zuckerberg's overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit for the reasons described above,",

Over 90% of the voting power of shares voted at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders were cast in favor of our say on pay proposal. Our then compensation committee considered the result of this advisory vote to be an endorsement of our compensation program,",
      " policies, practices and philosophy for our named executive officers. Our compensation & governance committee will continue to consider the outcome of our say on pay votes and our stockholder views when making compensation decisions for our named executive officers.\n\nBased on the results of a separate non-binding advisory stockholder vote on the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes regarding the compensation program of our named executive officers, commonly referred to as a \"say on frequency\" vote, held at our 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our board of directors determined that we will hold our say on pay vote every three years until the next required say on frequency vote. The next say on pay vote will take place at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nTax Deductibility\n\nSection 162(m)",
      " of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, limits the amount that we may deduct from our federal income taxes for compensation paid to our named executive officers to $1 million per executive officer per year. Prior law provided an exception to this deduction limit for compensation paid to our CFO and for certain \"performance-based compensation.\" Effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, this deduction limit will apply to all of our named executive officers, including our CFO, and the exception for \"performance-based compensation\" will no longer be available. As a result, compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for the transition relief applicable to certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2,",
      " 2017, including stock options that were granted through such date and RSUs that were granted before April 1, 2015. Because of the absence of formal guidance under the transition relief provisions, we cannot guarantee that any compensation arrangements intended to qualify for exemption under Section 162(m) will actually receive this treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile our compensation & governance committee is mindful of the benefit to us of the full tax deductibility of compensation, our compensation & governance committee believes that it should not be constrained by the requirements of Section 162(m) where those requirements would impair flexibility in compensating our named executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives.",
      " Therefore, our compensation & governance committee may approve compensation that may not be fully deductible because of the limits of Section 162(m). Our compensation & governance committee intends to continue to compensate our named executive officers in a manner it believes is consistent with the best interests of our company and our stockholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation Risk Assessment\n\nOur management team and the compensation & governance committee each play a role in evaluating and mitigating any risk that may exist relating to our compensation plans, practices, and policies for all employees, including our named executive officers. In early 2018, Compensia, the compensation & governance committee's independent compensation consultant, performed an assessment,",
      " in conjunction with management, of our compensation plans, practices and policies and concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. The compensation & governance committee has reviewed this report and agreed with the conclusion. The objective of the assessment was to identify any compensation plans, practices or policies that may encourage employees to take unnecessary risk that could threaten the company. No such plans, practices or policies were identified. The risk assessment process included, among other things, a review of our cash and equity incentive-based compensation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our company performance goals and the overall compensation to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay components and between short-term and long-term incentives.\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017 Summary Compensation Table\n\nThe following table presents summary information regarding the total compensation awarded to,",

The board of directors\u2019 recommendation on each proposal is presented immediately following our opposing statement to the proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC rules require that we provide the proponents with a copy of our opposing statement to their proposal at least 30 days prior to filing definitive copies of our proxy statement and form of proxy with the SEC.",
      " Accordingly, we provided the proponents with copies of our opposing statements prior to March 14, 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will promptly provide you with the name, address, and, to our knowledge, the number of voting securities held by the proponents of the Stockholder Proposals, upon receiving a written or oral request directed to: Facebook, Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, Attention: Corporate Secretary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL THREE:\n\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING CHANGE IN STOCKHOLDER VOTING\n\nGive Each Share an Equal Vote\n\nRESOLVED:\n\nShareholders request that our Board take all practicable steps in its control toward initiating and adopting a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have one vote per share.",

This is not intended to unnecessarily limit our Board\u2019s judgment in crafting the requested change in accordance with applicable laws and existing contracts.\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT:\n\nBy allowing certain stock to have more voting power than others, our company takes our public shareholder money but does not let us have an equal voice in our company\u2019s management. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg personally controls the firm with over 51% of the vote, though he owns only 14% of the economic value of the firm.\n\nWithout a voice,",
      " shareholders cannot hold management accountable. This was apparent in the 2016 vote to approve a non\u2010voting class of stock which has been described as a move that specifically sought to ensure that Mr. Zuckerberg retained control of our Company. Despite that almost 1.5 billion shares of stock voted AGAINST the creation of the non\u2010voting class in 2016, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s voting power alone was able to vote in the creation of the class. In fact, only threat of a lawsuit \"by shareholders who claimed that conflicts of interest and other behind\u2010the\u2010scenes discussions tainted a board decision to approve the creation of a new class of shares\"",
      " was able to incite a recent reversal of the restructuring plan.\n\nIndependent analysts appear to agree with our concerns. Facebook, Inc.\u2019s ISS Governance QualityScore as of December 1, 2017 is 10 (its highest risk category), including a pillar score of 10 for Board and 9 for Shareholder Rights indicating a relatively higher governance risk.\n\nOur company\u2019s own 10-K describes the risk of the current share system: \"Mark Zuckerberg... is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.",
      ".. this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support.\"\n\nWe urge shareholders to vote FOR a recapitalization plan for all outstanding stock to have one vote per share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFACEBOOK OPPOSING STATEMENT\n\nWe are focused on our mission of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. If we focus on this mission and build useful and engaging products and services, we believe we will create the most value for our stockholders over the long term. Our board of directors believes that our capital structure contributes to our stability and insulates our board of directors and management from short-term pressures,",
      " which allows them to focus on our mission and long-term success.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that our success is due in large part to the leadership of our founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, whose vision has guided us from our inception. Mr. Zuckerberg is invested in our long-term success, and under his guidance we have established a track record of creating value for our stockholders. Our board of directors believes that Mr. Zuckerberg has been, and will continue to be, a crucial part of our long-term success.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the non-employee members of our board of directors is independent under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules, and each of the committees of our board of directors is comprised entirely of independent directors.",

      " our stockholders rejected a substantially similar proposal at each of our last four annual meetings of our stockholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that our capital structure is in the best interests of our stockholders and that our current corporate governance structure is sound and effective.

      " and omit confidential and proprietary information).\n\nSupporting Statement:\n\nAccording to an article published by The Conference Board in the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation:\n\nA risk committee fosters an integrated, enterprise-wide approach to identifying and managing risk and provides an impetus toward improving the quality of risk reporting and monitoring, both for management and the board. This approach can assist the board in focusing on the \"big picture.\" A risk committee can also provide greater support for company executives who are given broad risk management responsibilities, resulting in a stronger focus at the board level on the adequacy of resources allocated to risk management. Finally, it allows the audit committee and other board committees to focus on their respective core responsibilities.\n\nFacebook\u2019s technological advances and scale appear to be significantly challenging the ability to understand its impact on society and may be creating numerous financial risks which could present material challenges to the company and its shareholders.",
      " Events illustrating this include, to name just a few:\n\n\u2022 Research linking Facebook to depression and other mental health issues;\n\n\u2022 Since 2011, Facebook has been operating under a 20 year Federal Trade Commission settlement agreement regarding user privacy practices;\n\n\u2022 Investigations into Russian meddling in U.S. elections and its role in proliferating \"fake news\";\n\n\u2022 Media coverage which demonstrated that its systems enabled advertisers to target users with offensive terms and other unintended consequences of its products;\n\n\u2022 Concerns over censorship in Myanmar and India;\n\n\u2022 Growing public and policy attention to the anti-competitive implications of platform monopolies;\n\n\u2022 Smugglers reportedly using Facebook to broadcast the abuse and torture of migrants to extort ransom money from their families;\n\n\u2022 Criticism from the Congressional Black Caucus over diversity and race relations;",
      " and\n\n\u2022 The purported use of Facebook as a platform to incite terrorism.\n\nEach of these individual cases may be addressable in a \"whack-a-mole\" fashion. However, they illustrate the growing concern that Facebook\u2019s Board lacks a strategic approach to risk. Unintended consequences seem to emerge daily, and indicate that the Board needs to have strong governance and risk oversight mechanisms to address these challenges and provide a \"big picture\" perspective.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Board has chosen not to establish a separate Risk Oversight Committee. Instead, according to Facebook\u2019s Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee, \"will discuss with the Company\u2019s management the Company\u2019s major financial risk and enterprise exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures,",
      " including the Company\u2019s procedures and any related policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.\" This is standard boilerplate language, which does not capture the particular challenges faced by Facebook.\n\nGiven the importance of better Board risk oversight, we believe the Board should establish a separate Risk Oversight Committee, especially given the numerous other and important responsibilities of the Audit Committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFACEBOOK OPPOSING STATEMENT\n\nWe believe that a thorough and strategic approach to risk oversight is critical to our company and that our current approach to risk oversight ensures that we identify, evaluate, and address our unique risks while providing a \"big picture\" perspective through regular engagement with key members of management and appropriate delegation to our current board committees.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur board of directors as a whole has responsibility for overseeing our risk management.",
      " The board of directors exercises this oversight responsibility directly and through its committees. The oversight responsibility of the board of directors and its committees is informed by regular reports from our management team, including senior personnel that lead a variety of functions across the business, and from our internal audit department, as well as input from external advisors, as appropriate. These reports are designed to provide timely visibility to the board of directors and its committees about the identification and assessment of key risks, our risk mitigation strategies, and ongoing developments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full board of directors has primary responsibility for evaluating strategic and operational risk management, and for CEO succession planning. Our audit committee has the responsibility for overseeing our major financial,",
      " legal, and regulatory risk exposures, which span a variety of areas including litigation, regulatory compliance, reputational and policy matters, platform integrity efforts, financial reporting, cybersecurity, and international operations. Our audit committee also oversees the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including policies and procedures for assessing and managing risk and related compliance efforts. Finally, our audit committee oversees our internal audit function. Our compensation & governance committee evaluates risks arising from our corporate governance and compensation policies and practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the proponent\u2019s suggestion to the contrary, our board of directors and committees currently spend a significant amount of time on matters relating to risk oversight as part of their existing duties.",
      " In particular, our audit committee focuses on many of the matters noted in the proponent\u2019s proposal. We believe that our board and committees have sufficient time and resources to address risk oversight matters along with their other responsibilities and that, given the size of our board of directors, it is inefficient to establish a separate risk oversight committee that would likely be comprised of some or all of the same directors that are already overseeing these matters.\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROPOSAL FIVE:\n\nSTOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE\n\nRESOLVED, Facebook, Inc.",
      " (FB) shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter and bylaws that calls for a greater than simple majority vote be eliminated, and replaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority in compliance with applicable laws. This means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for and against such proposals consistent with applicable laws. It is important that our company take each step necessary to adopt this proposal topic. It is also important that our company take each step necessary to avoid a failed vote on this proposal topic.\n\nSupporting Statement: Shareowners are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance.",
      " Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of six entrenching mechanisms that are negatively related to company performance according to \"What Matters in Corporate Governance\" by Lucien Bebchuk, Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=593423).\n\nSupermajority requirements are used to block initiatives supported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management.

We believe these provisions enable us to maximize value to our stockholders over the long-term, rather than optimizing for short-term profitability or other objectives that could jeopardize long-term success.

      " Facebook faces global controversy about Russia\u2019s reported election interference during the 2016 United States presidential election; rules that fail to distinguish hate speech from legitimate political expression, leading to the removal of legitimate user accounts; and the dissemination of violence through Facebook Live, broadcasting dozens of murders, suicides, and beatings.\n\nShareholders are concerned that Facebook\u2019s failure to have proactively addressed these issues poses significant regulatory, legal, and reputational risks to shareholder value.\n\nWe believe Facebook has an obligation to demonstrate how it manages content to prevent violations of its terms of service. Yet, disclosures have been inadequate. Content policies appear reactive, not proactive. As such,",
      " Facebook is embroiled in a string of controversies that have demonstrated the broad potential for misuse of its platform to spread lies, propaganda, and hate.\n\nIn May 2017, Elle outlined how the company\u2019s online platform perpetuates sexual harassment in an article entitled, \"Why Facebook\u2019s Harassment Policies Fail to Protect Women.\" In September 2017, it was reported that Facebook enabled advertisers to seek out self-described anti-Semites.

      " It enables us to build better products, make better decisions and serve our clients better. We are committed to building a more diverse workforce, and we believe gender diversity is central to that mission.\n\nThe gender pay gap, looking at median pay, compares the average pay between all men and all women in an organization. Looking at average pay means that the gender pay gap measures representation of men and women. It is different from equal pay, which means paying men and women the same for the same work.\n\nAt Facebook, we have been reviewing compensation for fairness and to ensure pay equity for many years. We complete thorough statistical analyses to compare the compensation of men and women performing similar work,",

We share this publicly each year (https://www.facebook.com/lori/posts/10101565060418174).\n\nLike many other companies in our industry, we have more men than women working at Facebook. This is particularly evident in technical roles, which tend to attract higher pay due to demand, and at senior levels. We have a long way to go, and we believe it is important to be open about it. We hold ourselves accountable by publicly releasing a diversity report each year. Beginning in 2014, we committed to publishing our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data annually,",

Over 500 students have graduated from Facebook University (FBU), our training program for college freshmen from underrepresented groups who demonstrate interest in STEM/CS. Many have returned to Facebook for internships and full-time jobs. In 2015, we publicly rolled out our comprehensive \"managing bias training,\" (http://managingbias.fb.com/",
      "). We have since added two new internal programs: Managing Inclusion, which trains managers to understand the issues that affect marginalized communities, and Be The Ally, which gives everyone at Facebook the common language, tools and space to practice supporting others. Finally, we globally rolled out our Diverse Slate Approach (DSA), which sets the expectation that hiring managers will consider candidates from underrepresented backgrounds when interviewing for an open position.\n\nWe believe retention is just as crucial as recruiting, which is why we invest in our thriving Facebook Resource Groups, and host annual leadership days. Women's Leadership Day is a full day of programming for all women employees at Facebook, and designed to empower,",
      " inspire and give people the tools to lead with confidence. The success of Women\u2019s Leadership Day has inspired us to host Black Leadership Day, Latin Leadership Day and Pride Leadership Day.\n\nWe are also working towards a more diverse tech workforce overall. In partnership with LeanIn.Org, LinkedIn, and the Anita Borg Institute, we launched Computer Science & Engineering (CS&E) Lean In Circles to bring together small groups of women to support one another as they pursue careers in computer science and engineering. We now have 296 circles on university campuses around the world and about 700 Lean IN-terns from 200 companies and 173 schools across the world.",
      " Additionally, we are creating opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities to enter and stay in tech through programs like TechPrep, a resource available in English and Spanish for parents, guardians and anyone who wants to learn about computer science and engineering, and TechStart, a partnership with public high schools to connect students to the world of technology. Finally, in 2016, we announced a $15 million commitment to Code.org over the next five years. This commitment will help Code.org drive the development of curricula, public school teacher-training and student skills-building, particularly among traditionally underrepresented populations in engineering and computer science.\n\nIn addition, our stockholders rejected similar proposals at our annual meeting of stockholders in both 2016 and 2017.\n\nGiven our ongoing compensation practices and diversity efforts,",

(\"Facebook\") ask the Board of Directors to respond to rising public pressure to limit offshore tax avoidance strategies by adopting and disclosing to shareholders a set of principles to guide Facebook\u2019s tax practices.",
      " For purposes of this Proposal, \"offshore tax avoidance strategies\" are transactions or arrangements that exploit differential tax treatment of financial instruments, asset transfers or entities by taxing jurisdictions to reduce a company\u2019s effective tax rate.\n\nThe principles should state that Facebook\u2019s board will:\n\n\u2022 Consider the impact of Facebook\u2019s global tax strategies on local economies and government services that benefit Facebook;\n\n\u2022 Ensure that Facebook seeks to pay tax where value is created;\n\n\u2022 Periodically assess the reputational consequences, including views of customers, shareholders and employees, of engaging in practices deemed to be \"tax avoidance\" by such stakeholders; and\n\n\u2022 Annually review Facebook\u2019s tax strategies and assess the alignment between the use of such strategies and Facebook\u2019s stated values or goals regarding sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUPPORTING STATEMENT\n\nCorporations have paid a dwindling share of U.S.",
      " federal taxes over the last 65 years, from 32% in 1952 to only 10.6% in 2015. (https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/04/corporate-tax-avoidance/478293/) Some multinational corporations minimize tax liability by shifting profits to subsidiaries domiciled in lower-tax jurisdictions through asset sales, loans and similar arrangements. Economist Gabriel Zucman claims the U.S. government loses almost $70 billion annually in tax revenue when corporations shift profits to tax havens. (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/opinion/gabriel-zucman-paradise-papers-tax-evasion.html?",

Recently, Facebook\u2019s own maneuvers have been scrutinized.",

      " and that the IRS has indicated that it will apply its position to later years, resulting in Facebook potentially owing an additional $3 to 5 billion, plus interest and penalties.\n\nMore generally, tax avoidance by corporations significantly affects public finances, which in turn can jeopardize key government services. Public opinion on offshore tax avoidance is decidedly negative. A June 2017 Hart poll found that \"end[ing] tax breaks for corporations that stash their profits offshore\" was the most important of 16 tax reform goals. (https://americansfortaxfairness.org/wp-content/uploads/ATF-Poll-TOPLINES.pdf)\n\nThe proposed Principles will help ensure that Facebook\u2019s board is fully informed regarding the impacts of offshore tax avoidance strategies and considers them when exercising its oversight responsibilities.",

Broadly, our approach to tax is to ensure that we comply with all applicable tax laws and ensure the payment of all taxes as required by law. While our board of directors and audit committee exercise oversight with respect to our tax compliance and risk management, our tax policies and practices involve highly complex and technical matters requiring detailed input and analysis from our management in consultation with external advisors.\n\nDay-to-day management of our tax policies and practices is guided by members of our management with expertise in both applicable tax laws and regulations as well as the company\u2019s business operations.",
      " Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate for management to have the flexibility to oversee and adapt our tax policies and practices as necessary in light of both regulatory and business developments. In addition, we currently make a number of public disclosures relating to our approach to tax compliance and risk. Key tax risks are described in our filings with the SEC, including in the \"Risk Factors\" section of our quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC.\n\nWe are already taking proactive steps to change our tax policies to increase transparency. In December 2017, we announced that we plan to move to a local selling model in all countries where we have an office to support sales to local advertisers.",
      " We are making this proactive global change to provide more transparency to governments and policymakers around the world who have called for greater visibility over the revenue associated with locally supported sales in their countries.\n\nIn addition, the United States enacted comprehensive tax reform in December 2017, which we expect will influence global tax policy discussions and impact existing international tax rules. Issues outlined in this proposal may change as a result of U.S. tax reform and subsequent international rulemakings.\n\nBecause we continuously assess our tax policies and practices in light of the changing regulatory landscape and developments in our business, and provide disclosure concerning our tax policies and risks, we believe that this proposal is not necessary and would not be beneficial to our stockholders.",
