    "context": "Introduction The child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 ( P.L. 105-34 ) to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment primarily to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax. Over the past 20 years, legislative changes have significantly changed the credit, transforming it from a generally nonrefundable credit available only to the middle and upper-middle class, to a refundable credit that more low-income families are eligible to claim.  This report provides an overview of the credit under current law and also provides some summary data on these benefits. For a complete legislative history of the credit, see CRS Report R45124, The Child Tax Credit: Legislative History , by [author name scrubbed].  Current Law The child tax credit allows taxpayers to reduce their federal income tax liability (the income taxes owed before tax credits are applied) by up to $2,000 per qualifying child. If the value of the credit exceeds the amount of tax a family owes, the family may be eligible to receive a full or partial refund of the difference. The refundable portion of the credit is sometimes referred to as the additional child tax credit or ACTC. The total amount of their refund is calculated as 15% (the refundability rate) of earnings that exceed $2,500 (the refundability threshold), up to the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit ($1,400 per child).  The credit phases out for higher-income taxpayers. The child tax credit can offset a taxpayer's Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) liability. Currently, the maximum credit per child, refundability threshold, and phaseout thresholds are not indexed for inflation. From 2018 to 2025, the maximum amount of the ACTC is indexed for inflation. Table 1 provides an overview of key provisions of the child tax credit under current law and how they will change, as scheduled under P.L. 115-97 .  Detailed Overview of Current Credit Each of the key parameters of the child tax credit as in effect from 2018-2025 is described in more detail below. The legislative changes made to the child tax credit by P.L. 115-97 have significantly expanded the child tax credit, especially for upper-income taxpayers, as illustrated in Figure 1 .  Maximum Credit per Child Eligible families can claim a child tax credit and reduce their federal income tax liability by up to $2,000 per qualifying child. The maximum credit a family can receive is equal to the number of qualifying children a taxpayer has, multiplied by $2,000. For example, a family with two qualifying children may be eligible for a $4,000 credit. Families may receive the child tax credit as a reduction in tax liability (the nonrefundable portion of the credit), a refundable credit (the amount of the credit in excess of tax liability), or a combination of both. The refundable portion of the credit\u2014the ACTC\u2014is discussed in the subsequent section. Beginning in 2026, the maximum amount of the credit is scheduled to revert to $1,000 per qualifying child.  Maximum Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) per Child, the Refundability Threshold and Refundability Rate For taxpayers with little or no federal income tax liability, they will be eligible for little if any of the nonrefundable portion of the child tax credit. Instead, they may be eligible to receive the child tax credit as a refundable credit. The refundable portion of the child tax credit is often referred to as the additional child tax credit or ACTC. The amount of the refundable child tax credit is generally calculated using the \"earned income formula\" up to the maximum ACTC amount of $1,400 per qualifying child. Under the earned income formula, a taxpayer may claim an ACTC equal to 15% of the family's earned income in excess of $2,500, up to the maximum ACTC amount (i.e., up to $1,400 multiplied by the number of qualifying children). The $2,500 amount is referred to as the refundability threshold; the 15% is referred to as the refundability rate. If a taxpayer's earnings are below the refundability threshold, they are ineligible for the ACTC. For every dollar of earnings above this amount, the value of the taxpayer's ACTC increases by 15 cents, up to the maximum amount of the credit ($1,400 per qualifying child). For purposes of calculating the ACTC, earned income is defined as wages, tips, and other compensation included in gross income. It also includes net self-employment income (self-employment income after deduction of one-half of Social Security payroll taxes paid by a self-employed individual). Beginning in 2026, the refundability threshold is scheduled to increase to $3,000 and the maximum ACTC per child (the amount that exceeds income tax liability) is scheduled to decrease to $1,000 per child.  The Phaseout Threshold and Phaseout Rate The child tax credit phases out for higher-income families. The $2,000-per-child value of the credit falls by a certain amount as a family's income rises. Specifically, for every $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) above a threshold amount, the credit falls by $50\u2014or effectively by 5% of MAGI above the threshold. The threshold amount depends on a taxpayer's filing status, and equals $200,000 for single parents and married taxpayers filing separate returns, and $400,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns. The actual income level at which the credit is entirely phased out (i.e., equals zero) depends on the number of qualifying children a taxpayer has. Generally, it takes $40,000 of MAGI above the phaseout threshold to completely phase out $2,000 of credit. For example, the credit will completely phase out for a married couple with two children if their MAGI exceeds $480,000 (see Figure 1 ). Definition of a Qualifying Child In order to claim the child tax credit, a taxpayer's child must be considered \"a qualifying child\" and meet several requirements which may differ from eligibility requirements for other child-related tax benefits: 1. The child must be under 17 years of age during the entire year for which the taxpayer claims the credit (for example, if the child was 16.5 years on December 31, 2017, the taxpayer could claim the credit on their 2017 federal income tax return). 2. The child must be eligible to be claimed as a dependent on the taxpayer's return. 3. The child must be the taxpayer's son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter, niece, nephew, or an eligible foster child of the taxpayer. 4. The child must live at the same principal residence as the taxpayer for more than half the year for which the taxpayer wishes to claim the credit. 5. The child cannot provide more than half of their own support during the tax year. 6. The child must be a U.S. citizen or national. If they are not a U.S. citizen or national, they must be a resident of the United States.  The age and citizenship requirements for a qualifying child for the child tax credit differ from the definition of qualifying child used for other tax benefits and can cause confusion among taxpayers. For example, a taxpayer's 18-year-old child may meet all the requirements for a qualifying child for the EITC, but will be too old to be eligible for the child tax credit. ID Requirements to Claim the Child Tax Credit The statute requires that taxpayers who intend to claim the child tax credit provide a valid taxpayer identification number (TIN) for each qualifying child on their federal income tax return. Under a temporary change in effect from 2018 through the end of 2025, the child's TIN must be a work-authorized Social Security number (SSN). The SSN must be issued before the due date of the tax return. Failure to provide the child's SSN may result in the taxpayer being denied the credit (both the nonrefundable and refundable portions of the credit). Absent any legislative changes, beginning in 2026, a valid TIN for qualifying children will include individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) and Social Security numbers (SSNs). ITINs are issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to noncitizens who do not have and are not eligible to receive SSNs. ITINs are supplied solely so that noncitizens are able to comply with federal tax law, and do not affect immigration status. In addition, in order to claim the child tax credit in a given tax year, the taxpayer must also provide their own taxpayer identification number that must be issued before the due date of the tax return. This is a permanent ID requirement that is not scheduled to expire. Disallowance of the Credit Due to Fraud or Reckless Disregard of the Rules A tax filer is barred from claiming the child tax credit for a period of 10 years after the IRS makes a final determination to reduce or disallow a tax filer's child tax credit because that individual made a fraudulent child tax credit claim. A tax filer is barred from claiming the child tax credit for a period of two years after the IRS determines that the individual made a child tax credit claim \"due to reckless and intentional disregard of [the] rules\" of the child tax credit, but that disregard was not found to be due to fraud.  Data on the Child Tax Credit Estimates from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Tax Policy Center highlight several key aspects of the child tax credit: The total dollar amount of the child tax credit has grown over time: Data from the IRS indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment. These estimates do not include the impact of recent legislative changes made by P.L. 115-97 , which, all else being equal, will expand the total cost of this tax benefit. In 2018, the majority of the tax benefit will go to taxpayers with income between $75,000 and $500,000 : The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that the majority of child tax credit dollars in 2018 will go to taxpayers with more than $75,000 of income, with nearly one-third of the benefit going to taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000. In comparison, a relatively small share will go to very-low-income or very-high-income taxpayers. In 2018, over 90% of taxpayers with children and income between $30,000 and $500,000 will receive the child tax credit. The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that across most income groups, the vast majority of taxpayers with children will receive the child tax credit in 2018. About half of the lowest-income taxpayers will receive the credit and no taxpayers with children and income over $1 million will receive the credit. In 2018, taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000 will on average receive the largest credit. The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that taxpayers with children and income between $100,000 and $200,000 will on average receive a credit of over $3,000 in 2018. Taxpayers with children with income under $20,000 will receive on average a credit of less than $1,000, while the wealthiest taxpayers with children will receive on average a credit of $10. Total Child Tax Credit Dollars, 1998-2015  IRS estimates of the amount of total child tax credit dollars (inflation adjusted to 2015 dollars) received by taxpayers indicate that this tax benefit has more than doubled in size since enactment, from aggregate receipt of $22 billion in 1998 to approximately $54 billion in 2015, as illustrated in Figure 2 .  A significant component in the growth of the child tax credit has been the growth in the refundable portion of the credit, which now comprises approximately half of child tax credit dollars received by taxpayers. (For an overview of the legislative changes that have influenced the expansion of both the refundable and nonrefundable portions of the credit, see CRS Report R45124, The Child Tax Credit: Legislative History , by [author name scrubbed].) The most recent IRS data available are for the 2015 tax year (i.e., 2015 income tax returns filed in 2016), and hence do not include the impact of the legislative changes made to the credit by P.L. 115-97 . As previously discussed, these legislative changes are currently scheduled to be in effect from 2018 through the end of 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that the modification to the child tax credit formula will cost an estimated $573.4 billion between 2018 and 2026, or on average $64 billion a year. (These estimates include the budgetary cost of the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child tax-credit-eligible dependents.) JCT also estimates that the new SSN requirement will save $29.8 billion between 2018 and 2026, or on average $3 billion per year.  Total Child Tax Credit Dollars by Income Level The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimated the distribution of aggregate child tax credit by income level for 2018 under current law (i.e., including the changes made by P.L. 115-97 ). These estimates include the $500 credit for non-child tax-credit-eligible dependents. TPC estimates that nearly one-third of all child tax credit dollars (31%) will go to taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000, as illustrated in Figure 3 .  Slightly more than one-quarter of all child tax credit dollars (26.5%) will go to taxpayers with income under $50,000. Lower-income taxpayers will generally receive a credit of $1,400 or less per child, depending on their earnings. In contrast, higher-income taxpayers with sufficient income tax liability will receive a credit of $2,000 per child. For example, a single parent with two children and $15,000 of income will be eligible for a $1,875 credit (received entirely as the refundable child credit or ACTC), less than the maximum ACTC for two children of $2,800 (2x $1,400) and less than the maximum credit for two children of $4,000 (2 x $2,000). The highest-income taxpayers will not receive a credit due to the credit phaseout. Share of Taxpayers with Children Receiving the Child Tax Credit TPC estimated the share of all taxpayers and taxpayers with children that would receive the child tax credit in 2018. The estimates indicate that among taxpayers with children, almost all taxpayers will receive the child tax credit. More than 90% of taxpayers with children and income between $40,000 and $500,000 will receive the child tax credit. In contrast, about half (51%) of taxpayers with children and income under $10,000 will receive the child tax credit in 2018, and less than one-fifth (18%) of taxpayers with income between $500,000 and $1 million will receive the credit, as illustrated in Figure 4 . Fewer low-income families with children will benefit from the child tax credit since taxpayers with income under $2,500 (the refundability threshold) will not be eligible for the refundable portion of the credit. In contrast, due to the phaseout of the credit at higher income levels, virtually no taxpayers with income over $1 million will be eligible to claim it. Average Child Tax Credit Amount  TPC estimated the average child tax credit amount by income level for all taxpayers and taxpayers with children in 2018. Their estimates indicate that taxpayers with children and income between $100,000 and $200,000 will receive the largest credit on average\u2014an estimated $3,100. Taxpayers with income under $20,000 will receive on average a credit of less than $1,000, while the wealthiest taxpayers with children (income over $1 million) will on average receive a credit of $10. Lower-income taxpayers are eligible to receive a credit of up to $1,400 per child, although they may receive less depending on their earned income. In contrast, higher-income taxpayers, with sufficient income tax liability, will be eligible for up to a $2,000 credit per child. The highest-income taxpayers will be ineligible for the credit due to the phaseout. \n",

    "answer": "This report provides an overview of the child tax credit under current law, including temporary changes made by the 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97). When calculating the total amount of federal income taxes owed, eligible taxpayers can reduce their federal income tax liability by the amount of the child tax credit. Currently, eligible families that claim the child tax credit can subtract up to $2,000 per qualifying child from their federal income tax liability. The maximum amount of credit a family can receive is equal to the number of qualifying children in a family multiplied by $2,000. If a family's tax liability is less than the value of their child tax credit, they may be eligible for a refundable credit calculated using the earned income formula. Under this formula, a family is eligible for a refund equal to 15% of their earnings in excess of $2,500, up to the maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit. The maximum amount of the refundable portion of the credit is $1,400 per qualifying child. The credit phases out for single parents with income over $200,000 and married couples with income over $400,000. Many of these parameters are scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 under P.L. 115-97. The child tax credit was created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) to help ease the financial burden that families incur when they have children. Like other tax credits, the child tax credit reduces tax liability dollar for dollar of the value of the credit. Initially the child tax credit was a nonrefundable credit for most families. A nonrefundable tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer's income tax liability to zero, while a refundable tax credit can exceed a taxpayer's income tax liability, providing a cash payment to low-income taxpayers who owe little or no income tax.  Since it was first enacted, the child tax credit has undergone significant changes. Most recently at the end of 2017, Congress expanded the credit, especially for middle- and upper-income taxpayers, by doubling the credit amount and more than tripling the income level at which the credit begins to phase out. Additional, although comparatively more modest, changes were made to the refundable portion of the credit as well, including increasing the refundable credit amount from $1,000 to $1,400 per child and lowering the refundability threshold from $3,000 to $2,500. These changes are scheduled to be in effect from 2018 through the end of 2025.  Estimates from the IRS indicate that the total dollar amount of the child tax credit has increased significantly since enactment from approximately $22 billion to $54 billion. These estimates do not include the impact of recent legislative changes made by P.L. 115-97, which will, all else being equal, expand the total cost of this tax benefit.  The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimated the distribution of the child tax credit by income level for 2018 under current law (including the changes made by P.L. 115-97) and found that the majority of child tax credit dollars will go to taxpayers with more than $75,000 of income, with nearly one-third of the benefit going to taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000. In comparison, a relatively small share will go to very-low-income or very-high-income taxpayers. TPC also estimated that the vast majority of taxpayers with children will receive the child tax credit. About half of the lowest-income taxpayers will receive the credit and no taxpayers with children and income over $1 million will receive the credit. Finally, TPC estimated that taxpayers with income between $100,000 and $200,000 will on average receive the largest credit of over $3,000. Taxpayers with children and income under $20,000 will receive on average a credit of less than $1,000, while the wealthiest taxpayers with children will receive on average a credit of $10.\n",

    "context": "Background Driving is a complex task that depends on visual, cognitive, and physical  functions that enable a person to  see traffic and road conditions;  recognize what is seen, process the information, and decide how to   physically act to control the vehicle. Although the aging process affects people at different rates and in different  ways, functional declines associated with aging can affect driving ability.  For example, vision declines may reduce the ability to see other vehicles,  traffic signals, signs, lane markings, and pedestrians; cognitive declines  may reduce the ability to recognize traffic conditions, remember  destinations, and make appropriate decisions in operating the vehicle; and  physical declines may reduce the ability to perform movements required to  control the vehicle. A particular concern is older drivers with dementia, often as a result of  illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dementia impairs cognitive and  sensory functions causing disorientation, potentially leading to dangerous  driving practices. Age is the most significant risk factor for developing  dementia\u2014approximately 12 percent of those aged 65 to 84 are likely to  develop the condition while over 47 percent of those aged 85 and older are  likely to be afflicted. For drivers with the condition, the risk of being  involved in a crash is two to eight times greater than for those with no  cognitive impairment. However, some drivers with dementia, particularly  in the early stages, may still be capable of driving safely. Older drivers experience fewer fatal crashes per licensed driver compared  with drivers in younger age groups; however, on the basis of miles driven,  older drivers have a comparatively higher involvement in fatal crashes.  Over the past decade, the rate of older driver involvement in fatal crashes,  measured on the basis of licensed drivers, has decreased and, overall, older  drivers have a lower rate of fatal crashes than drivers in younger age  groups (see fig. 1). Older drivers\u2019 fatal crash rate per licensed driver is  lower than corresponding rates for drivers in younger age groups, in part,  because older drivers drive fewer miles per year than younger drivers, may  hold licenses even though they no longer drive, and may avoid driving  during times and under conditions when crashes tend to occur, such as  during rush hour or at night. However, on the basis of miles traveled, older  drivers who are involved in a crash are more likely to suffer fatal injuries  than are drivers in younger age groups who are involved in crashes. As  shown in figure 2, drivers aged 65 to 74 are more likely to be involved in a  fatal crash than all but the youngest drivers (aged 16 to 24), and drivers  aged 75 and older are more likely than drivers in all other age groups to be  involved in a fatal crash. Older drivers will be increasingly exposed to crash risks because older  adults are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, and future  generations of older drivers are expected to drive more miles per year and  at older ages compared with the current older-driver cohort. The U.S.  Census Bureau projects that the population of adults aged 65 and older will  more than double, from 35.1 million people (12.4 percent of total  population) in 2000 to 86.7 million people (20.7 percent of total population)  in 2050 (see fig. 3). Intersections pose a particular safety problem for older drivers. Navigating  through intersections requires the ability to make rapid decisions, react  quickly, and accurately judge speed and distance. As these abilities can  diminish through aging, older drivers have more difficulties at intersections  and are more likely to be involved in a fatal crash at these locations.  Research shows that 37 percent of traffic-related fatalities involving drivers  aged 65 and older occur at intersections compared with 18 percent for  drivers aged 26 to 64. Figure 4 illustrates how fatalities at intersections  represent an increasing proportion of all traffic fatalities as drivers age. DOT\u2014through FHWA and NHTSA\u2014has a role in promoting older driver  safety, although states are directly responsible for operating their roadways  and establishing driver licensing requirements. FHWA focuses on roadway  engineering and has established guidelines for designers to use in  developing engineering enhancements to roadways to accommodate the  declining functional capabilities of older drivers. NHTSA focuses on  reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities among older people by  promoting, in conjunction with nongovernmental organizations, research,  education, and programs aimed at identifying older drivers with functional  limitations that impair driving performance. NHTSA has developed several  guides, brochures, and booklets for use by the medical community, law  enforcement officials, older drivers\u2019 family members, and older drivers  themselves that provide guidance on what actions can be taken to improve  older drivers\u2019 capabilities or to compensate for lost capabilities.  Additionally, NIA supports research related to older driver safety through  administering grants designed to examine, among other issues, how  impairments in sensory and cognitive functions impact driving ability. These federal initiatives support state efforts to make roads safer for older  drivers and establish assessment practices to evaluate the fitness of older  drivers. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A  Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), signed into law in August 2005,  establishes a framework for federal investment in transportation and has  specific provisions for older driver safety. SAFETEA-LU authorizes $193.1  billion in Federal-Aid Highway Program funds to be distributed through  FHWA for states to implement road preservation, improvement, and  construction projects, some of which may include improvements for older  drivers. SAFETEA-LU also directs DOT to carry out a program to improve  traffic signs and pavement markings to accommodate older drivers. To  fulfill these requirements, FHWA has updated or plans to update its  guidebooks on highway design for older drivers, plans to conduct  workshops on designing roads for older drivers that will be available to  state practitioners, and has added a senior mobility series to its bimonthly  magazine that highlights advances and innovations in highway/traffic  research and technology. Additionally, SAFTEA-LU authorizes NHTSA to  spend $1.7 million per year (during fiscal years 2006 through 2009) in  establishing a comprehensive research and demonstration program to  improve traffic safety for older drivers. FHWA Has  Recommended  Practices and Made  Funding Available to  Make Roads Safer for  Older Drivers, but  States Generally Give  Higher Priority to  Other Safety Issues FHWA has recommended practices for designing and operating roadways  to make them safer for older drivers and administers SAFETEA-LU funds  that states\u2014which own and operate most roadways under state or local  government authority\u2014may use for road maintenance or construction  projects to improve roads for older drivers. To varying degrees, states are  implementing FHWA\u2019s older driver practices and developing plans and  programs that consider older drivers\u2019 needs. However, responses to our  survey indicated that other safety issues\u2014such as railway and highway  intersections and roadside hazard elimination\u2014are of greater concern to  states, and states generally place a higher priority on projects that address  these issues rather than projects targeted only towards older drivers. FHWA Has Recommended  Road Design and Operating  Practices and Funds  Programs to Improve Older  Driver Safety FHWA has issued guidelines and recommendations to states on practices  that are intended to make roads safer for older drivers, such as the  Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians. The  practices emphasize cost-effective construction and maintenance  measures involving both the physical layout of the roadway and use of  traffic control devices such as signs, pavement markings, and traffic  signals. The practices are specifically designed to improve conditions at  sites\u2014intersections, interchanges, curved roads, construction work zones,  and railroad crossings\u2014known to be unsafe for older drivers. While these  practices are designed to address older drivers\u2019 needs, implementation of  these practices can make roads safer for all drivers. Intersections\u2014Recognizing that intersections are particularly  problematic for older drivers, FHWA\u2019s top priority in its Highway  Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians is intersection  improvements. Practices to improve older drivers\u2019 ability to navigate  intersections include using bigger signs with larger lettering to identify  street names, consistent placement of lane use signs and arrow  pavement markings, aligning lanes to improve drivers\u2019 ability to see  oncoming traffic, and using reflective markers on medians and island  curbs at intersections to make them easier to see at night. See figures 5  through 8 for these and additional intersection improvement practices. Interchanges\u2014Practices to aid older drivers at interchanges include  using signs and pavement markings to better identify right and wrong  directions of travel and configuring on-ramps to provide a longer  distance for accelerating and merging into traffic. See figure 9 for these  and additional interchange improvement practices. Road curves\u2014Practices to assist older drivers on curves include using  signs and reflective markers\u2014especially on tight curves\u2014to clearly  delineate the path of the road. See figure 10 for these and additional  curve improvement practices. Construction work zones\u2014Practices to improve older driver safety in  construction work zones include increasing the length of time messages  are visible on changeable message signs; providing easily discernable  barriers between opposing traffic lanes in crossovers; using properly  sized devices (cones and drums) to delineate temporary lanes; and  installing temporary reflective pavement markers to make lanes easier  to navigate at night. Railroad crossings\u2014Practices to help older drivers are aimed at  making the railroad crossing more conspicuous by using reflective  materials on the front and back of railroad crossing signs and  delineating the approach to the crossing with reflective posts. See figure  11 for these and additional railroad crossing improvement practices. FHWA is continuing to research and develop practices to make roads safer  for older drivers. FHWA also promotes the implementation of these  practices by sponsoring studies and demonstration projects, updating its  Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians, and  training state and local transportation officials. For example, FHWA is  supporting a research study\u2014to be conducted over the next 3 to 5 years\u2014 on the effectiveness of selected low-cost road improvements in reducing  the number and severity of crashes for all drivers. With the findings of this  and other studies, FHWA plans to update its guidelines to refine existing or  recommend new practices in improving older driver safety. In addition,  FHWA is considering changes to its MUTCD\u2014to be published in 2009\u2014that  will enhance older driver safety by updating standards related to sign  legibility and traffic signal visibility. Under SAFETEA-LU, FHWA provides funding that states may use to  implement highway maintenance or construction projects that can enhance  older driver safety. However, because projects to enhance older driver  safety can be developed under several different SAFETEA-LU programs, it  is difficult to determine the amount of federal funding dedicated to  highway improvements for older drivers. While older driver safety is  generally not the primary focus of projects funded through SAFETEA-LU  programs, improvements made to roads may incorporate elements of  FHWA\u2019s older driver safety practices. For example, under SAFETEA-LU\u2019s  Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), states submit a Strategic  Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) after reviewing crash and other data and  determining what areas need to be emphasized when making safety  improvements. If older driver safety is found to be an area of emphasis, a  state may develop projects to be funded under the HSIP that provide, for  example, improved traffic signs, pavement markings, and road layouts  consistent with practices listed in FHWA\u2019s Highway Design Handbook for  Older Drivers and Pedestrians. Some States Have  Implemented FHWA\u2019s  Recommended Practices  and Considered Older  Drivers in Highway Safety  Plans and Programs, but  Other Safety Issues  Generally Receive Greater  Priority State DOTs have, to varying degrees, incorporated FHWA\u2019s older driver  safety practices into their design standards; implemented the practices in  construction, operations, and maintenance activities; trained technical  staff in applying the practices; and coordinated with local agencies to  promote the use of the practices. The states\u2019 responses to our survey  indicate the range in states\u2019 efforts. Design standards. Nearly half of the states have incorporated about half or  more of FHWA\u2019s practices into their design standards, as follows: 24 state DOTs reported including about half, most, almost all, or all of  the recommendations.  20 reported including some of the recommendations.   6 reported including few or none of the recommendations. Construction, operations, and maintenance activities. Even though most  state DOTs have not incorporated all FHWA practices into their design  standards, the majority of states have implemented some FHWA practices  in construction, operations, and maintenance activities, particularly in the  areas of intersections and work zones (see table 1). Training. Nearly one-fourth of state DOTs have provided training on  FHWA practices to half or more of their technical staff, as follows:   12 state DOTs reported having trained about half, most, almost all, or all  of their technical staff.  32 have trained some of their technical staff.   7 have trained few or none of their technical staff. Coordination with local agencies. Because state transportation agencies  do not own local roads\u2014which may account for the majority of roads in a  state\u2014coordination with local governments is important in promoting  older driver safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of local roads.  The states reported using a variety of methods in their work with local  governments to improve older driver safety (see table 2). States also varied in their efforts to consult stakeholders on older driver  issues in developing highway safety plans (defined in the state SHSP) and  lists of projects in their Statewide Transportation Improvement Programs  (STIP). According to our survey, 27 of the 51 state DOTs have established  older driver safety as a component of their SHSPs, and our survey indicated  that, in developing their SHSPs, these states were more likely to consult  with stakeholders concerned about older driver safety than were states  that did not include an older driver component in their plans. Obtaining  input from stakeholders concerned about older driver safety\u2014from both  governmental and nongovernmental organizations\u2014is important because  they can contribute additional information, and can sometimes provide  resources, to address older driver safety issues. For example, elderly  mobility was identified by the Michigan State Safety Commission to be an  emerging issue and, in February 1998, funded the Southeast Michigan  Council of Governments (SEMCOG) to convene a statewide,  interdisciplinary Elderly Mobility and Safety Task Force. SEMCOG  coordinated with various stakeholder groups\u2014Michigan DOT, Michigan  Department of State, Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning,  Michigan Department of Community Health, Office of Services to the  Aging, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, agencies  on aging, and AAA Michigan among others\u2014in developing a statewide plan  to address older driver safety and mobility issues. This plan\u2014which  outlines recommendations in the areas of traffic engineering, alternative  transportation, housing and land use, health and medicine, licensing, and  education and awareness\u2014forms the basis for the strategy defined in  Michigan\u2019s SHSP to address older drivers\u2019 mobility and safety. Even though 27 state DOTs have reported establishing older driver safety  as a component of their SHSPs, only 4 state DOTs reported including older  driver safety improvement projects in their fiscal year 2007 STIPs.  However, state STIPs may contain projects that will benefit older drivers.  For example, 49 state DOTs reported including funding for intersection  improvements in their STIPs. Because drivers are increasingly more likely  to be involved in an intersection crash as they age, older drivers, in  particular, should benefit from states\u2019 investments in intersection safety  projects, which generally provide improved signage, traffic signals,  turning lanes, and other features consistent with FHWA\u2019s older driver safety  practices. Although older driver safety could become a more pressing need in the  future as the population of older drivers increases, states are applying their  resources to areas that pose greater safety concerns. In response to a  question in our survey about the extent to which resources\u2014defined to  include staff hours and funds spent on research, professional services, and  construction contracts\u2014were invested in different types of safety projects,  many state DOTs indicated that they apply resources to a great or very  great extent to safety projects other than those concerning older driver  safety (see table 3). Survey responses indicated that resource constraints  are a significant contributing factor to limiting states\u2019 implementation of  FHWA\u2019s older driver safety practices and development of strategic plans  and programs that consider older driver concerns. More than Half of  States Have  Implemented Some  Assessment Practices  for Older Drivers, and  NHTSA Is Sponsoring  Research to Develop  More Comprehensive  Assessments More than half of state licensing agencies have implemented assessment  practices to support licensing requirements for older drivers that are more  stringent than requirements for younger drivers. These requirements\u2014 established under state licensing procedures\u2014generally involve more  frequent renewals (16 states), mandatory vision screening (10 states), in- person renewals (5 states) and mandatory road tests (2 states). However,  assessment of driver fitness in all states is not comprehensive because  cognitive and physical functions are generally not evaluated to the same  extent as visual function. Furthermore, the effectiveness of assessment  practices used by states is largely unknown. Recognizing the need for  better assessment tools, NHTSA is developing more comprehensive  practices to assess driver fitness and intends to provide technical  assistance to states in implementing these practices. Over Half of the States Have  More Stringent Licensing  Requirements for Older  Drivers, but Assessment  Practices Are Not  Comprehensive Over half of the states have procedures that establish licensing  requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than requirements  for younger drivers. These requirements generally include more frequent  license renewal, mandatory vision screening, in-person renewals, and  mandatory road tests. In addition, states may also consider input from  medical advisory boards, physician reports, and third-party referrals in  assessing driver fitness and making licensing decisions. (See fig. 12 and  app. II for additional details.) Accelerated renewal\u2014Sixteen states have accelerated renewal cycles  for older drivers that require drivers older than a specific age to renew  their licenses more frequently. Colorado, for example, normally requires  drivers to renew their licenses every 10 years, but drivers aged 61 and  older must renew their licenses every 5 years. Vision screening\u2014Ten states require older drivers to undergo vision  assessments, conducted by either the Department of Motor Vehicles or  their doctor, as part of the license renewal process. These assessments  generally test for visual acuity or sharpness of vision. For example, the  average age for mandatory vision screening is 62, with some states  beginning this screening as early as age 40 (Maine and Maryland) and  other states beginning as late as age 80 (Florida and Virginia). In-person renewal\u2014Five states\u2014Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,  and Louisiana\u2014that otherwise allow license renewal by mail require  older drivers to renew their licenses in person. Arizona, California, and  Louisiana do not permit mail renewal for drivers aged 70 and older.  Alaska does not allow mail renewal for drivers aged 69 and older, while  Colorado requires in-person renewal for those over age 61. Road test\u2014Two states, New Hampshire and Illinois, require older  drivers to pass road examinations upon reaching 75 years and at all  subsequent renewals. In addition, states have adopted other practices to assist licensing agencies  in assessing driver fitness and identifying older drivers whose driving  fitness may need to be reevaluated. Medical Advisory Boards\u2014Thirty-five states and the District of  Columbia rely on Medical Advisory Boards (MAB) to assist licensing  agencies in evaluating people with medical conditions or functional  limitations that may affect their ability to drive. A MAB may be  organizationally placed within a state\u2019s transportation, public safety, or  motor vehicle department. Board members\u2014practicing physicians or  health care professionals\u2014are typically nominated or appointed by the  state medical association, motor vehicle administrator, or governor\u2019s  office. Some MABs review individual cases typically compiled by case  workers who collect and review medical and other evidence such as  accident reports that is used to make a determination about a person\u2019s  fitness to drive. The volume of cases reviewed by MABs varies greatly  across states. For example, seven state MABs review more than 1,000  cases annually, while another seven MABs review fewer than 10 cases  annually. Physician reports\u2014While all states accept reports of potentially unsafe  drivers from physicians, nine states require physicians to report physical  conditions that might impair driving skills. For example, California  specifically requires doctors to report a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease  or related disorders, including dementia, while Delaware, New Jersey,  and Nevada require physicians to report cases of epilepsy and those  involving a person\u2019s loss of consciousness. However, not all states  assure physicians that such reports will be kept confidential, so  physicians may choose not to report patients if they fear retribution in  the form of a lawsuit or loss of the patient\u2019s business. Third-party referrals\u2014In addition to reports from physicians, all states  accept third-party referrals of concerns about drivers of any age. Upon  receipt of the referral, the licensing agency may choose to contact the  driver in question to assess the person\u2019s fitness to drive. A recent survey  of state licensing agencies found that nearly three-fourths of all referrals  came from law enforcement officials (37 percent) and physicians or  other medical professionals (35 percent). About 13 percent of all  referrals came from drivers\u2019 families or friends, and 15 percent came  from crash and violation record checks, courts, self-reports, and other  sources. However, the assessment practices that state licensing agencies use to  evaluate driver fitness are not comprehensive. For example, our review of  state assessment practices indicates that all states screen for vision, but we  did not find a state with screening tools to evaluate physical and cognitive  functions. Furthermore, the validity of assessment practices used by  states is largely unknown. While research indicates that in-person license  renewal is associated with lower crash rates\u2014particularly for those aged  85 and older\u2014other assessment practices, such as vision screening, road  tests, and more frequent license renewal cycles, are not always associated  with lower older driver fatality rates. According to NHTSA, there is  insufficient evidence on the validity and reliability of any driving  assessment or screening tool. Thus, states may have difficulty discerning  which tools to implement. NHTSA Is Developing More  Comprehensive Practices to  Assess Driver Fitness NHTSA, supported by the NIA and by partner nongovernmental  organizations, has promoted research and development of mechanisms to  assist licensing agencies and other stakeholders\u2014medical providers, law  enforcement officers, social service providers, family members\u2014in better  identifying medically at-risk individuals; assessing their driving fitness  through a comprehensive evaluation of visual, physical, and cognitive  functions; and enabling their driving for as long as safely possible. In the  case of older drivers, NHTSA recognizes that only a fraction of older  drivers are at increased risk of being involved in an accident and focuses its  efforts on providing appropriate research-based materials and information  to the broad range of stakeholders who can identify and influence the  behavior of at-risk drivers. Initiatives undertaken by NHTSA and its  partner organizations include:   Model Driver Screening and Evaluation Program. Initially developed  by NHTSA in partnership with AAMVA and supported with researchers  funded by NIA\u2014the program provides a framework for driver referral,  screening assessment, counseling, and licensing actions. The guidance  is based on research that relates an individual\u2019s functional abilities to  driving performance and reflects the results of a comprehensive  research project carried out in cooperation with the Maryland Motor  Vehicle Administration. Recent research supported under this program  and with NIA grants evaluated a range of screenings related to visual,  physical, and cognitive functions that could be completed at a licensing  agency and may effectively identify drivers at an increased risk of being  involved in a crash. Physician\u2019s Guide to Assessing and Counseling Older Drivers. Developed by the American Medical Association to raise awareness  among physicians, the guide cites relevant literature and expert views  (as of May 2003) to assist physicians in judging patients\u2019 fitness to drive.  The guide is based on NHTSA\u2019s earlier work with the Association for the  Advancement of Automotive Medicine. This work\u2014a detailed literature  review\u2014summarized knowledge about various categories of medical  conditions, their prevalence, and their potential impact on driving  ability. Countermeasures That Work: A Highway Safety Countermeasure  Guide for State Highway Safety Offices. Developed with the Governors  Highway Safety Association, this publication describes current  initiatives in the areas of communications and outreach, licensing, and  law enforcement\u2014and the associated effectiveness, use, cost, and time  required for implementation\u2014that state agencies might consider for  improving older driver safety. NHTSA Web site. NHTSA maintains an older driver Web site with  content for drivers, caregivers, licensing administrators, and other  stakeholders to help older drivers remain safe. NIA research. NIA is supporting research on several fronts in studying  risk factors for older drivers and in developing new tools for driver  training and driver fitness assessment. A computer-based training tool is being developed to help older  drivers improve the speed with which they process visual  information. This tool is a self-administered interactive variation of  validated training techniques that have been shown to improve visual  processing speed. The tool is being designed as a cost-effective  mechanism that can be broadly implemented, at social service  organizations, for example, and made accessible to older drivers. Driving simulators are being studied as a means of testing driving  ability and retraining drivers in a manner that is more reliable and  consistent than on-road testing. Virtual reality driving simulation is a  potentially viable means of testing that could more accurately  identify cognitive and motor impairments than could on-road tests  that are comparatively less safe and more subjective. Research is ongoing to evaluate the impacts of hearing loss on  cognitive functions in situations, such as driving, that require  multitasking. Results of the research may provide insights into what  level of auditory processing is needed for safe driving and may lead  to development of future auditory screening tools. Studies that combine a battery of cognitive function and road/driving  simulator tests are being conducted to learn how age-related changes  lead to hazardous driving.  Results of these studies may prove useful  in developing screening tests to identify functionally-impaired  drivers\u2014particularly those with dementia\u2014who are at risk of being  involved in a crash and may be unfit to drive. NHTSA is also developing guidelines to assist states in implementing  assessment practices. To date, NHTSA\u2019s research and model programs have  had limited impact on state licensing practices. For example, according to  NHTSA, no state has implemented the guidelines outlined in its Model  Driver Screening and Evaluation Program. Furthermore, there is  insufficient evidence on the validity and reliability of driving assessments,  so states may have difficulty discerning which assessments to implement.  To assist states in implementing assessment practices, NHTSA, as  authorized under SAFETEA-LU section 2017, developed a plan to, among  other things, (1) provide information and guidelines to people (medical  providers, licensing personnel, law enforcement officers) who can  influence older drivers and (2) improve the scientific basis for licensing  decisions. In its plan NHTSA notes that the most important work on older  driver safety that needs to occur in the next 5 years is refining screening  and assessment tools and getting them into the hands of the users who  need them. As an element of its plan, NHTSA is cooperating with AAMVA to  create a Medical Review Task Force that will identify areas where  standards of practice to assess the driving of at-risk individuals are possible  and develop strategies for implementing guidelines that states can use in  choosing which practices to adopt. The task force will\u2014in areas such as  vision and cognition\u2014define existing practices used by states and identify  gaps in research to encourage consensus on standards. NHTSA officials  said that work is currently under way to develop neurological guidelines\u2014 which will cover issues related to cognitive assessments\u2014and anticipate  that the task force will report its findings in 2008. Selected States Have  Implemented  Coordinating Groups  and Other Initiatives to  Promote Older Driver  Safety Of the six states we visited, five\u2014California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, and  Michigan\u2014 have active multidisciplinary coordination groups that may  include government, medical, academic, and social service representatives,  among others, to develop strategies and implement efforts to improve older  driver safety. Each of these states identified its coordination group as a  key initiative in improving older driver safety. As shown in table 4, the  coordinating groups originated in different ways and vary in size and  structure. For example, Florida\u2019s At-Risk Driver Council was formally  established under state legislation while Maryland\u2019s group functions on an  ad hoc basis with no statutory authority. The approaches taken by these  groups in addressing older driver safety issues vary as well. For example,  California\u2019s large task force broadly reaches several state agencies and  partner organizations, and the task force leaders oversee the activity of  eight work groups in implementing multiple action items to improve older  driver safety. In contrast, Iowa\u2019s Older Driver Target Area Team is a smaller  group that operates through informal partnerships among member  agencies and is currently providing consulting services to the Iowa  Department of Transportation on the implementation of older driver  strategies identified in Iowa\u2019s Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan. Members of the coordination groups we spoke with said that their state  could benefit from information about other states\u2019 practices. For example,  coordinating group members told us that sharing information about leading  road design and licensing practices, legislative initiatives, research efforts,  and model training programs that affect older drivers could support  decisions about whether to implement new practices. Furthermore, group  members said that identifying the research basis for practices could help  them assess the benefits to be derived from implementing a particular  practice. While some mechanisms exist to facilitate information exchanges  on some topics, such as driver fitness assessment and licensing through  AAMVA\u2019s Web site, there is no mechanism for states to share information  on the broad range of efforts related to older driver safety. In addition to coordinating groups, the six states have ongoing efforts to  improve older driver safety in the areas of strategic planning, education  and awareness, licensing and driver fitness assessment, engineering, and  data analysis. The following examples highlight specific initiatives and  leading practices in each of these categories. Strategic planning\u2014Planning documents establish recommended actions  and provide guidance to stakeholders on ways to improve older driver  safety. The Michigan Senior Mobility Action Plan, issued in November 2006,  builds upon the state\u2019s 1999 plan (Elderly Mobility & Safety\u2014The  Michigan Approach) and outlines additional strategies, discusses  accomplishments, and sets action plans in the areas of planning,  research, education and awareness, engineering countermeasures,  alternative transportation, housing and land use, and licensing designed  to (1) reduce the number and severity of crashes involving older drivers  and pedestrians, (2) increase the scope and effectiveness of alternative  transportation options available to older people, (3) assist older people  in maintaining mobility safely for as long as possible, and (4) plan for a  day when driving may no longer be possible. In implementing this plan,  officials are exploring the development of a community-based resource  center that seniors can use to find information on mobility at a local  level. Traffic Safety among Older Adults: Recommendations for  California\u2014developed through a grant from California\u2019s Office of  Traffic Safety and published in August 2002\u2014offers a comprehensive set  of recommendations and provides guidance to help agencies and  communities reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities to older adults.  The Older Californian Traffic Safety Task Force was subsequently  established to coordinate the implementation of the report\u2019s  recommendations. Education/awareness\u2014Education and public awareness initiatives enable  outreach to stakeholders interested in promoting older driver safety. Florida GrandDriver\u00ae\u2014based on a program developed by AAMVA\u2014 takes a multifaceted approach to public outreach through actions such  as providing Web-based information related to driver safety courses and  alternative transportation; training medical, social service and  transportation professionals; offering safety talks at senior centers; and  sponsoring CarFit events. According to the Florida Department of  Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, a total of 75 training programs and  outreach events were conducted under the GrandDriver program  between 2000 and 2006. California\u2014through its Older Californian Traffic Safety Task Force\u2014 annually holds a \u201cSenior Safe Mobility Summit\u201d that brings subject- matter experts and recognized leaders together to discuss issues and  heighten public understanding of long-term commitments needed to  help older adults drive safely longer. Assessment/licensing\u2014Assessment and licensing initiatives are concerned  with developing better means for stakeholders\u2014license administrators,  medical professionals, law enforcement officers, family members\u2014to  determine driver fitness and provide remedial assistance to help older  people remain safe while driving. California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles is continuing to develop a  progressive \u201cthree-tier\u201d system for determining drivers\u2019 wellness\u2014 through nondriving assessments in the first two tiers\u2014and estimating  driving fitness in a third-tier road test designed to assess the driver\u2019s  ability to compensate for driving-relevant functional limitations identified in the first two tiers. The system, currently being tested at  limited locations, is being developed to keep people driving safely for as  long as possible by providing a basis for a conditional licensing program  that can aid drivers in improving their driving-relevant functioning and  in adequately compensating for their limitations. Oregon requires physicians and other designated medical providers to  report drivers with severe and uncontrollable cognitive or functional  impairments that affect the person\u2019s ability to drive safely. Oregon  Driver and Motor Vehicle Services (ODMVS) evaluates each report and  determines if immediate suspension of driving privileges is necessary. A  person whose driving privileges have been suspended needs to obtain  medical clearance and pass ODMVS vision, knowledge, and road tests in  order to have his or her driving privileges reinstated. In cases where  driving privileges are not immediately suspended, people will normally  be given between 30 and 60 days to pass ODMVS tests or provide  medical evidence indicating that the reported condition does not  present a risk to their safe driving. Maryland was the first state to establish a Medical Advisory Board  (MAB)\u2014created by state legislation in 1947\u2014which is currently one of  the most active boards in the United States. Maryland\u2019s MAB manages  approximately 6000 cases per year\u2014most involving older drivers.  Drivers are referred from a number of sources\u2014including physicians,  law enforcement officers, friends, and relatives\u2014and the MAB reviews  screening results, physician reports, and driving records among other  information to determine driving fitness. The MAB\u2019s opinion is then  considered by Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle Administration in making  licensing decisions. The Iowa Department of Motor Vehicles can issue older drivers  restricted licenses that limit driving to daylight hours, specific  geographic areas, or low-speed roads. Restricted licensing, also referred  to as \u201cgraduated de-licensing,\u201d seeks to preserve the driver\u2019s mobility  while protecting the health of the driver, passengers, and others on the  road by limiting driving to low risk situations. About 9,000 older drivers  in Iowa have restricted licenses. Iowa license examiners may travel to  test older drivers in their home towns, where they feel most comfortable  driving. Engineering\u2014Road design elements such as those recommended by  FHWA are implemented to provide a driving environment that  accommodates older drivers\u2019 needs. A demonstration program in Michigan, funded through state, county,  and local government agencies, along with AAA Michigan, made low- cost improvements at over 300 high-risk, urban, signalized intersections  in the Detroit area. An evaluation of 30 of these intersections indicated  that the injury rate for older drivers was reduced by more than twice as  much as for drivers aged 25 to 64 years. The next phase of the program  is development of a municipal tool kit for intersection safety, for use by  municipal leaders and planners, to provide a template for implementing  needed changes within their jurisdictions. The Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) has undertaken several  initiatives in road operations, maintenance, and new construction to  enhance the driving environment for older drivers. Among its several  initiatives, IDOT is  using more durable pavement markings on selected roads and  servicing all pavement markings on a performance-based schedule to  maintain their brightness, adding paved shoulders with the edge line painted in a shoulder  rumble strip to increase visibility and alert drivers when their  vehicles stray from the travel lane,  converting 4-lane undivided roads to 3-lane roads with a dedicated  left-turn lane to simplify turning movements, encouraging the use of more dedicated left turn indications (arrows)  on traffic signals on high-speed roads,  installing larger street name signs,  replacing warning signs with ones that have a fluorescent yellow  background to increase visibility,   converting to Clearview fonts on Interstate signs for increased sign   demonstrating older driver and pedestrian-friendly enhancements on  a roadway corridor in Des Moines, and   promoting local implementation of roadway improvements to benefit  older drivers by providing training to city and county engineers and  planners. The Transportation Safety Work Group of the Older Californian Traffic  Safety Task Force provided engineering support in updating California\u2019s  highway design and traffic control manuals to incorporate FHWA\u2019s  recommended practices for making travel safer and easier for older  drivers. Technical experts from the work group coordinated with the  Caltrans design office in reviewing the Caltrans Highway Design  Manual and updating elements related to older driver safety.  Additionally, the work group managed an expedited process to have the  California Traffic Control Devices Committee consider and approve  modifications to signing and pavement marking standards in the  California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices that benefit  older drivers. Data analysis\u2014Developing tools to accurately capture accident data  enables trends to be identified and resources to be directed to remediating  problems. Iowa has a comprehensive data system that connects information from  multiple sources, including law enforcement records (crash reports,  traffic citations, truck inspection records) and driver license and  registration databases, and can be easily accessed. For example, the  system allows law enforcement officers to electronically access a  person\u2019s driving record and license information at a crash scene and  enter their crash reports into the data system on-scene. Data captured  through this process\u2014including the location of all crashes\u2014is less  prone to error and can be geographically referenced to identify safety  issues. In the case of older driver safety, several universities are utilizing  Iowa crash data in research efforts. For example, University of Northern  Iowa researchers utilized crash data and geospatial analysis to  demonstrate how older driver crash locations could be identified and  how roadway elements could be subsequently modified to improve  safety for older drivers. University of Iowa researchers have used the  data in behavioral research to study actions of older drivers and learn  where changes in roadway geometrics, signing, or other roadway  elements could assist older drivers with their driving tasks. Also, Iowa  State University\u2019s Center for Transportation Research and Education  (CTRE) has used the data to study a number of older driver crash  characteristics and supports other older driver data analysis research  projects with the Iowa Traffic Safety Data Service. Florida is developing a Mature Driver Database (MDDB) that will collect  several types of data\u2014vision renewal data, crash data, medical review  data\u2014to be accessible through the Department of Highway Safety and  Motor Vehicles (DHSMV) Web site. According to DHSMV officials, this  database is intended to be used across agencies to facilitate strategic  planning. DHSMV may use the database, for example, to track driver  performance on screenings and analyze the effectiveness of screening  methods. Planned MDDB enhancements include providing links to  additional data sources such as census and insurance databases. Conclusion Older driver safety is not a high-priority issue in most states and, therefore,  receives fewer resources than other safety concerns. However, the aging of  the American population suggests that older driver safety issues will  become more prominent in the future. Some states\u2014with federal  support\u2014have adopted practices to improve the driving environment for  older road users and have implemented assessment practices to support  licensing requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than  requirements for younger drivers. However, information on the  effectiveness of these practices is limited, and states have been reluctant to  commit resources to initiatives whose effectiveness has not been clearly  demonstrated. Some states have also implemented additional initiatives to  improve older driver safety, such as establishing coordination groups  involving a broad range of stakeholders and developing initiatives in the  areas of strategic planning, education and outreach, assessment and  licensing practices, engineering, and data analysis. NHTSA and FHWA also  have important roles to play in promoting older driver safety, including  conducting and supporting research on standards for the driving  environment and on driver fitness assessment. While states hold differing  views on the importance of older driver safety and have adopted varying  practices to address older driver safety issues, it is clear that there are  steps that states can take to prepare for the anticipated increase in the  older driver population and simultaneously improve safety for all drivers.  However, state resources are limited, so information on other states\u2019  initiatives or federal efforts to develop standards for the driving  environment and on driver fitness assessment practices could assist states  in implementing improvements for older driver safety. Recommendation for  Executive Action To help states prepare for the substantial increase in the number of older  drivers in the coming years, we recommend that the Secretary of  Transportation direct the FHWA and NHTSA Administrators to implement  a mechanism that would allow states to share information on leading  practices for enhancing the safety of older drivers. This mechanism could  also include information on other initiatives and guidance, such as FHWA\u2019s  research on the effectiveness of road design practices and NHTSA\u2019s  research on the effectiveness of driver fitness assessment practices. Agency Comments and  Our Evaluation We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human  Services and to the Department of Transportation for review and comment.

GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are  listed in appendix IV. Objectives, Scope, and Methodology This report addresses (1) what the federal government has done to  promote practices to make roads safer for older drivers and the extent to  which states have implemented those practices, (2) the extent to which  states assess the fitness of older drivers and what support the federal  government has provided, and (3) what initiatives selected states have  implemented to improve the safety of older drivers. To determine what the federal government has done to promote practices  to make roads safer for older drivers, we interviewed officials from the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) within the U.S. Department of  Transportation (DOT) and the American Association of State and Highway  Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and reviewed manuals and other  documentation to determine what road design standards and guidelines  have been established, the basis for their establishment, and how they have  been promoted. We also reviewed research and interviewed a  representative of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program  (NCHRP) to gain perspective on federal initiatives to improve the driving  environment for older drivers. Finally, to determine trends in accidents  involving older drivers, we reviewed and analyzed crash data from the U.S.  DOT\u2019s Fatality Analysis Reporting System database and General Estimates  System database. To obtain information on the extent to which states are implementing these  practices, we surveyed and received responses from DOTs in each of the 50  states and the District of Columbia. We consulted with NCHRP, FHWA, and  AASHTO in developing the survey. The survey was conducted from the end  of September 2006 through mid-January 2007. During this time period, we  sent two waves of follow-up questionnaires to nonrespondents in addition  to the initial mailing. We also made phone calls and sent e-mails to a few  states to remind them to return the questionnaire. We surveyed state DOTs  to learn the extent to which they have incorporated federal government  recommendations on road design elements into their own design guides  and implemented selected recommendations in their construction,  operations, and maintenance activities. We also identified reasons for state  DOTs rejecting recommendations and determined the proportion of  practitioners that were trained in each state to implement  recommendations. In addition, we asked state DOTs to evaluate the extent  to which they have developed plans (defined in Strategic Highway Safety  Plans) and programmed projects (listed in Statewide Transportation  Improvement Programs) for older driver safety as provided for by  SAFETEA-LU legislation. Before fielding the questionnaire, we reviewed the Safe, Accountable,  Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users  (SAFETEA-LU) and prior highway legislation to identify the framework for  states to develop and implement older driver safety programs. Additionally,  we conducted separate in-person pretests with officials from three state  DOTs and revised our instrument as a result of the information obtained  during those pretests. We took steps in developing the questionnaire and in  collecting and analyzing the data to minimize errors that could occur  during those stages of the survey process. A copy of the questionnaire and  detailed survey results are available at www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO- 07-517SP. To determine the extent to which states assess the fitness of older drivers  and what support the federal government has provided, we interviewed  officials and reviewed relevant documents from the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration within the U.S. DOT, the National Institute on  Aging and the Administration on Aging within the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services, and the American Association of Motor  Vehicle Administrators\u2014a nongovernmental organization that represents  state driver licensing agencies. We determined the extent to which the  guidelines and model programs of these agencies addressed the visual,  physical, and cognitive deficits that may afflict older drivers. We also  reviewed federal, state, and nongovernmental Web sites that contained  information on states\u2019 older driver licensing practices and analyzed their  content so that we could compare practices across states. To obtain  information on the activities of partner nongovernmental organizations in  researching and promoting practices to assess older driver fitness, among  other initiatives, we interviewed officials from AAA, AARP, the Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety, and the Governors Highway Safety  Association. To learn of states\u2019 legislative initiatives concerning driver  fitness assessment and licensing, we interviewed a representative of the  National Conference of State Legislatures. We also interviewed officials  from departments of motor vehicles in select states to report on their  efforts in developing, implementing, and evaluating older driver screening  and licensing programs. To obtain information on initiatives that selected states have implemented,  we conducted case studies in six states\u2014California, Florida, Iowa,  Maryland, Michigan, and Oregon\u2014that transportation experts identified as  progressive in their efforts to improve older driver safety. We chose our  case study states based on input from an NCHRP report highlighting states  with leading practices in the areas of:  education/awareness,  assessment/licensing, engineering, agency coordination, strategic planning  and data analysis. We compared practices across the six states to identify  common themes. We also identified and determined, to the extent possible,  key practices based on our analysis. The scope of our work focused on older driver safety. Prior GAO work  addressed the associated issue of senior mobility for those who do not  drive. We conducted our review from April 2006 through April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We  requested official comments on this report from the U.S. Department of  Transportation and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. States\u2019 Licensing Requirements for Older  Drivers Tables 5 through 7 list older driver licensing requirements in effect in  certain states.

      "Background Driving is a complex task that depends on visual, cognitive, and physical  functions that enable a person to  see traffic and road conditions;  recognize what is seen, process the information, and decide how to   physically act to control the vehicle. Although the aging process affects people at different rates and in different  ways, functional declines associated with aging can affect driving ability.  For example, vision declines may reduce the ability to see other vehicles,  traffic signals, signs, lane markings, and pedestrians; cognitive declines  may reduce the ability to recognize traffic conditions, remember  destinations, and make appropriate decisions in operating the vehicle; and  physical declines may reduce the ability to perform movements required to  control the vehicle.",
      " A particular concern is older drivers with dementia, often as a result of  illnesses such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Dementia impairs cognitive and  sensory functions causing disorientation, potentially leading to dangerous  driving practices. Age is the most significant risk factor for developing  dementia\u2014approximately 12 percent of those aged 65 to 84 are likely to  develop the condition while over 47 percent of those aged 85 and older are  likely to be afflicted. For drivers with the condition, the risk of being  involved in a crash is two to eight times greater than for those with no  cognitive impairment. However, some drivers with dementia,",
      " particularly  in the early stages, may still be capable of driving safely. Older drivers experience fewer fatal crashes per licensed driver compared  with drivers in younger age groups; however, on the basis of miles driven,  older drivers have a comparatively higher involvement in fatal crashes.  Over the past decade, the rate of older driver involvement in fatal crashes,  measured on the basis of licensed drivers, has decreased and, overall, older  drivers have a lower rate of fatal crashes than drivers in younger age  groups (see fig. 1). Older drivers\u2019 fatal crash rate per licensed driver is  lower than corresponding rates for drivers in younger age groups,",
      " in part,  because older drivers drive fewer miles per year than younger drivers, may  hold licenses even though they no longer drive, and may avoid driving  during times and under conditions when crashes tend to occur, such as  during rush hour or at night. However, on the basis of miles traveled, older  drivers who are involved in a crash are more likely to suffer fatal injuries  than are drivers in younger age groups who are involved in crashes. As  shown in figure 2, drivers aged 65 to 74 are more likely to be involved in a  fatal crash than all but the youngest drivers (aged 16 to 24), and drivers  aged 75 and older are more likely than drivers in all other age groups to be  involved in a fatal crash.",
      " Older drivers will be increasingly exposed to crash risks because older  adults are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, and future  generations of older drivers are expected to drive more miles per year and  at older ages compared with the current older-driver cohort. The U.S.  Census Bureau projects that the population of adults aged 65 and older will  more than double, from 35.1 million people (12.4 percent of total  population) in 2000 to 86.7 million people (20.7 percent of total population)  in 2050 (see fig. 3). Intersections pose a particular safety problem for older drivers.",
      " Navigating  through intersections requires the ability to make rapid decisions, react  quickly, and accurately judge speed and distance. As these abilities can  diminish through aging, older drivers have more difficulties at intersections  and are more likely to be involved in a fatal crash at these locations.  Research shows that 37 percent of traffic-related fatalities involving drivers  aged 65 and older occur at intersections compared with 18 percent for  drivers aged 26 to 64. Figure 4 illustrates how fatalities at intersections  represent an increasing proportion of all traffic fatalities as drivers age. DOT\u2014through FHWA and NHTSA\u2014has a role in promoting older driver  safety,",
      " although states are directly responsible for operating their roadways  and establishing driver licensing requirements. FHWA focuses on roadway  engineering and has established guidelines for designers to use in  developing engineering enhancements to roadways to accommodate the  declining functional capabilities of older drivers. NHTSA focuses on  reducing traffic-related injuries and fatalities among older people by  promoting, in conjunction with nongovernmental organizations, research,  education, and programs aimed at identifying older drivers with functional  limitations that impair driving performance. NHTSA has developed several  guides, brochures, and booklets for use by the medical community, law  enforcement officials, older drivers\u2019 family members,",
      " and older drivers  themselves that provide guidance on what actions can be taken to improve  older drivers\u2019 capabilities or to compensate for lost capabilities.  Additionally, NIA supports research related to older driver safety through  administering grants designed to examine, among other issues, how  impairments in sensory and cognitive functions impact driving ability. These federal initiatives support state efforts to make roads safer for older  drivers and establish assessment practices to evaluate the fitness of older  drivers. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A  Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), signed into law in August 2005,  establishes a framework for federal investment in transportation and has  specific provisions for older driver safety.",
      " SAFETEA-LU authorizes $193.1  billion in Federal-Aid Highway Program funds to be distributed through  FHWA for states to implement road preservation, improvement, and  construction projects, some of which may include improvements for older  drivers. SAFETEA-LU also directs DOT to carry out a program to improve  traffic signs and pavement markings to accommodate older drivers. To  fulfill these requirements, FHWA has updated or plans to update its  guidebooks on highway design for older drivers, plans to conduct  workshops on designing roads for older drivers that will be available to  state practitioners, and has added a senior mobility series to its bimonthly  magazine that highlights advances and innovations in highway/",
      "traffic  research and technology. Additionally, SAFTEA-LU authorizes NHTSA to  spend $1.7 million per year (during fiscal years 2006 through 2009) in  establishing a comprehensive research and demonstration program to  improve traffic safety for older drivers. FHWA Has  Recommended  Practices and Made  Funding Available to  Make Roads Safer for  Older Drivers, but  States Generally Give  Higher Priority to  Other Safety Issues FHWA has recommended practices for designing and operating roadways  to make them safer for older drivers and administers SAFETEA-LU funds  that states\u2014which own and operate most roadways under state or local  government authority\u2014may use for road maintenance or construction  projects to improve roads for older drivers.",
      " To varying degrees, states are  implementing FHWA\u2019s older driver practices and developing plans and  programs that consider older drivers\u2019 needs. However, responses to our  survey indicated that other safety issues\u2014such as railway and highway  intersections and roadside hazard elimination\u2014are of greater concern to  states, and states generally place a higher priority on projects that address  these issues rather than projects targeted only towards older drivers. FHWA Has Recommended  Road Design and Operating  Practices and Funds  Programs to Improve Older  Driver Safety FHWA has issued guidelines and recommendations to states on practices  that are intended to make roads safer for older drivers, such as the  Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians.",
      " The  practices emphasize cost-effective construction and maintenance  measures involving both the physical layout of the roadway and use of  traffic control devices such as signs, pavement markings, and traffic  signals. The practices are specifically designed to improve conditions at  sites\u2014intersections, interchanges, curved roads, construction work zones,  and railroad crossings\u2014known to be unsafe for older drivers. While these  practices are designed to address older drivers\u2019 needs, implementation of  these practices can make roads safer for all drivers. Intersections\u2014Recognizing that intersections are particularly  problematic for older drivers, FHWA\u2019s top priority in its Highway  Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians is intersection  improvements.",
      " Practices to improve older drivers\u2019 ability to navigate  intersections include using bigger signs with larger lettering to identify  street names, consistent placement of lane use signs and arrow  pavement markings, aligning lanes to improve drivers\u2019 ability to see  oncoming traffic, and using reflective markers on medians and island  curbs at intersections to make them easier to see at night. See figures 5  through 8 for these and additional intersection improvement practices. Interchanges\u2014Practices to aid older drivers at interchanges include  using signs and pavement markings to better identify right and wrong  directions of travel and configuring on-ramps to provide a longer  distance for accelerating and merging into traffic.",
      " See figure 9 for these  and additional interchange improvement practices. Road curves\u2014Practices to assist older drivers on curves include using  signs and reflective markers\u2014especially on tight curves\u2014to clearly  delineate the path of the road. See figure 10 for these and additional  curve improvement practices. Construction work zones\u2014Practices to improve older driver safety in  construction work zones include increasing the length of time messages  are visible on changeable message signs; providing easily discernable  barriers between opposing traffic lanes in crossovers; using properly  sized devices (cones and drums) to delineate temporary lanes; and  installing temporary reflective pavement markers to make lanes easier  to navigate at night.",
      " Railroad crossings\u2014Practices to help older drivers are aimed at  making the railroad crossing more conspicuous by using reflective  materials on the front and back of railroad crossing signs and  delineating the approach to the crossing with reflective posts. See figure  11 for these and additional railroad crossing improvement practices. FHWA is continuing to research and develop practices to make roads safer  for older drivers. FHWA also promotes the implementation of these  practices by sponsoring studies and demonstration projects, updating its  Highway Design Handbook for Older Drivers and Pedestrians, and  training state and local transportation officials. For example, FHWA is  supporting a research study\u2014to be conducted over the next 3 to 5 years\u2014 on the effectiveness of selected low-cost road improvements in reducing  the number and severity of crashes for all drivers.",
      " With the findings of this  and other studies, FHWA plans to update its guidelines to refine existing or  recommend new practices in improving older driver safety. In addition,  FHWA is considering changes to its MUTCD\u2014to be published in 2009\u2014that  will enhance older driver safety by updating standards related to sign  legibility and traffic signal visibility. Under SAFETEA-LU, FHWA provides funding that states may use to  implement highway maintenance or construction projects that can enhance  older driver safety. However, because projects to enhance older driver  safety can be developed under several different SAFETEA-LU programs, it  is difficult to determine the amount of federal funding dedicated to  highway improvements for older drivers.",
      " While older driver safety is  generally not the primary focus of projects funded through SAFETEA-LU  programs, improvements made to roads may incorporate elements of  FHWA\u2019s older driver safety practices. For example, under SAFETEA-LU\u2019s  Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), states submit a Strategic  Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) after reviewing crash and other data and  determining what areas need to be emphasized when making safety  improvements. If older driver safety is found to be an area of emphasis, a  state may develop projects to be funded under the HSIP that provide, for  example, improved traffic signs,",
      " pavement markings, and road layouts  consistent with practices listed in FHWA\u2019s Highway Design Handbook for  Older Drivers and Pedestrians. Some States Have  Implemented FHWA\u2019s  Recommended Practices  and Considered Older  Drivers in Highway Safety  Plans and Programs, but  Other Safety Issues  Generally Receive Greater  Priority State DOTs have, to varying degrees, incorporated FHWA\u2019s older driver  safety practices into their design standards; implemented the practices in  construction, operations, and maintenance activities; trained technical  staff in applying the practices; and coordinated with local agencies to  promote the use of the practices. The states\u2019 responses to our survey  indicate the range in states\u2019 efforts.",
      " Design standards. Nearly half of the states have incorporated about half or  more of FHWA\u2019s practices into their design standards, as follows: 24 state DOTs reported including about half, most, almost all, or all of  the recommendations.  20 reported including some of the recommendations.   6 reported including few or none of the recommendations. Construction, operations, and maintenance activities. Even though most  state DOTs have not incorporated all FHWA practices into their design  standards, the majority of states have implemented some FHWA practices  in construction, operations, and maintenance activities, particularly in the  areas of intersections and work zones (see table 1). Training.",
      " Nearly one-fourth of state DOTs have provided training on  FHWA practices to half or more of their technical staff, as follows:   12 state DOTs reported having trained about half, most, almost all, or all  of their technical staff.  32 have trained some of their technical staff.   7 have trained few or none of their technical staff. Coordination with local agencies. Because state transportation agencies  do not own local roads\u2014which may account for the majority of roads in a  state\u2014coordination with local governments is important in promoting  older driver safety in the design, operation, and maintenance of local roads.",
      "  The states reported using a variety of methods in their work with local  governments to improve older driver safety (see table 2). States also varied in their efforts to consult stakeholders on older driver  issues in developing highway safety plans (defined in the state SHSP) and  lists of projects in their Statewide Transportation Improvement Programs  (STIP). According to our survey, 27 of the 51 state DOTs have established  older driver safety as a component of their SHSPs, and our survey indicated  that, in developing their SHSPs, these states were more likely to consult  with stakeholders concerned about older driver safety than were states  that did not include an older driver component in their plans.",
      " Obtaining  input from stakeholders concerned about older driver safety\u2014from both  governmental and nongovernmental organizations\u2014is important because  they can contribute additional information, and can sometimes provide  resources, to address older driver safety issues. For example, elderly  mobility was identified by the Michigan State Safety Commission to be an  emerging issue and, in February 1998, funded the Southeast Michigan  Council of Governments (SEMCOG) to convene a statewide,  interdisciplinary Elderly Mobility and Safety Task Force. SEMCOG  coordinated with various stakeholder groups\u2014Michigan DOT, Michigan  Department of State, Michigan Office of Highway Safety Planning,",
      "  Michigan Department of Community Health, Office of Services to the  Aging, University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, agencies  on aging, and AAA Michigan among others\u2014in developing a statewide plan  to address older driver safety and mobility issues. This plan\u2014which  outlines recommendations in the areas of traffic engineering, alternative  transportation, housing and land use, health and medicine, licensing, and  education and awareness\u2014forms the basis for the strategy defined in  Michigan\u2019s SHSP to address older drivers\u2019 mobility and safety. Even though 27 state DOTs have reported establishing older driver safety  as a component of their SHSPs, only 4 state DOTs reported including older  driver safety improvement projects in their fiscal year 2007 STIPs.",
      "  However, state STIPs may contain projects that will benefit older drivers.  For example, 49 state DOTs reported including funding for intersection  improvements in their STIPs. Because drivers are increasingly more likely  to be involved in an intersection crash as they age, older drivers, in  particular, should benefit from states\u2019 investments in intersection safety  projects, which generally provide improved signage, traffic signals,  turning lanes, and other features consistent with FHWA\u2019s older driver safety  practices. Although older driver safety could become a more pressing need in the  future as the population of older drivers increases, states are applying their  resources to areas that pose greater safety concerns.",
      " In response to a  question in our survey about the extent to which resources\u2014defined to  include staff hours and funds spent on research, professional services, and  construction contracts\u2014were invested in different types of safety projects,  many state DOTs indicated that they apply resources to a great or very  great extent to safety projects other than those concerning older driver  safety (see table 3). Survey responses indicated that resource constraints  are a significant contributing factor to limiting states\u2019 implementation of  FHWA\u2019s older driver safety practices and development of strategic plans  and programs that consider older driver concerns. More than Half of  States Have  Implemented Some  Assessment Practices  for Older Drivers,",
      " and  NHTSA Is Sponsoring  Research to Develop  More Comprehensive  Assessments More than half of state licensing agencies have implemented assessment  practices to support licensing requirements for older drivers that are more  stringent than requirements for younger drivers. These requirements\u2014 established under state licensing procedures\u2014generally involve more  frequent renewals (16 states), mandatory vision screening (10 states), in- person renewals (5 states) and mandatory road tests (2 states). However,  assessment of driver fitness in all states is not comprehensive because  cognitive and physical functions are generally not evaluated to the same  extent as visual function. Furthermore, the effectiveness of assessment  practices used by states is largely unknown.",
      " Recognizing the need for  better assessment tools, NHTSA is developing more comprehensive  practices to assess driver fitness and intends to provide technical  assistance to states in implementing these practices. Over Half of the States Have  More Stringent Licensing  Requirements for Older  Drivers, but Assessment  Practices Are Not  Comprehensive Over half of the states have procedures that establish licensing  requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than requirements  for younger drivers. These requirements generally include more frequent  license renewal, mandatory vision screening, in-person renewals, and  mandatory road tests. In addition, states may also consider input from  medical advisory boards, physician reports,",
      " and third-party referrals in  assessing driver fitness and making licensing decisions. (See fig. 12 and  app. II for additional details.) Accelerated renewal\u2014Sixteen states have accelerated renewal cycles  for older drivers that require drivers older than a specific age to renew  their licenses more frequently. Colorado, for example, normally requires  drivers to renew their licenses every 10 years, but drivers aged 61 and  older must renew their licenses every 5 years. Vision screening\u2014Ten states require older drivers to undergo vision  assessments, conducted by either the Department of Motor Vehicles or  their doctor, as part of the license renewal process.",
      " These assessments  generally test for visual acuity or sharpness of vision. For example, the  average age for mandatory vision screening is 62, with some states  beginning this screening as early as age 40 (Maine and Maryland) and  other states beginning as late as age 80 (Florida and Virginia). In-person renewal\u2014Five states\u2014Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,  and Louisiana\u2014that otherwise allow license renewal by mail require  older drivers to renew their licenses in person. Arizona, California, and  Louisiana do not permit mail renewal for drivers aged 70 and older.  Alaska does not allow mail renewal for drivers aged 69 and older,",
      " while  Colorado requires in-person renewal for those over age 61. Road test\u2014Two states, New Hampshire and Illinois, require older  drivers to pass road examinations upon reaching 75 years and at all  subsequent renewals. In addition, states have adopted other practices to assist licensing agencies  in assessing driver fitness and identifying older drivers whose driving  fitness may need to be reevaluated. Medical Advisory Boards\u2014Thirty-five states and the District of  Columbia rely on Medical Advisory Boards (MAB) to assist licensing  agencies in evaluating people with medical conditions or functional  limitations that may affect their ability to drive. A MAB may be  organizationally placed within a state\u2019s transportation,",
      " public safety, or  motor vehicle department. Board members\u2014practicing physicians or  health care professionals\u2014are typically nominated or appointed by the  state medical association, motor vehicle administrator, or governor\u2019s  office. Some MABs review individual cases typically compiled by case  workers who collect and review medical and other evidence such as  accident reports that is used to make a determination about a person\u2019s  fitness to drive. The volume of cases reviewed by MABs varies greatly  across states. For example, seven state MABs review more than 1,000  cases annually, while another seven MABs review fewer than 10 cases  annually.",
      " Physician reports\u2014While all states accept reports of potentially unsafe  drivers from physicians, nine states require physicians to report physical  conditions that might impair driving skills. For example, California  specifically requires doctors to report a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease  or related disorders, including dementia, while Delaware, New Jersey,  and Nevada require physicians to report cases of epilepsy and those  involving a person\u2019s loss of consciousness. However, not all states  assure physicians that such reports will be kept confidential, so  physicians may choose not to report patients if they fear retribution in  the form of a lawsuit or loss of the patient\u2019s business. Third-party referrals\u2014In addition to reports from physicians,",
      " all states  accept third-party referrals of concerns about drivers of any age. Upon  receipt of the referral, the licensing agency may choose to contact the  driver in question to assess the person\u2019s fitness to drive. A recent survey  of state licensing agencies found that nearly three-fourths of all referrals  came from law enforcement officials (37 percent) and physicians or  other medical professionals (35 percent). About 13 percent of all  referrals came from drivers\u2019 families or friends, and 15 percent came  from crash and violation record checks, courts, self-reports, and other  sources. However, the assessment practices that state licensing agencies use to  evaluate driver fitness are not comprehensive.",
      " For example, our review of  state assessment practices indicates that all states screen for vision, but we  did not find a state with screening tools to evaluate physical and cognitive  functions. Furthermore, the validity of assessment practices used by  states is largely unknown. While research indicates that in-person license  renewal is associated with lower crash rates\u2014particularly for those aged  85 and older\u2014other assessment practices, such as vision screening, road  tests, and more frequent license renewal cycles, are not always associated  with lower older driver fatality rates. According to NHTSA, there is  insufficient evidence on the validity and reliability of any driving  assessment or screening tool.",
      " Thus, states may have difficulty discerning  which tools to implement. NHTSA Is Developing More  Comprehensive Practices to  Assess Driver Fitness NHTSA, supported by the NIA and by partner nongovernmental  organizations, has promoted research and development of mechanisms to  assist licensing agencies and other stakeholders\u2014medical providers, law  enforcement officers, social service providers, family members\u2014in better  identifying medically at-risk individuals; assessing their driving fitness  through a comprehensive evaluation of visual, physical, and cognitive  functions; and enabling their driving for as long as safely possible. In the  case of older drivers, NHTSA recognizes that only a fraction of older  drivers are at increased risk of being involved in an accident and focuses its  efforts on providing appropriate research-based materials and information  to the broad range of stakeholders who can identify and influence the  behavior of at-risk drivers.",
      " Initiatives undertaken by NHTSA and its  partner organizations include:   Model Driver Screening and Evaluation Program. Initially developed  by NHTSA in partnership with AAMVA and supported with researchers  funded by NIA\u2014the program provides a framework for driver referral,  screening assessment, counseling, and licensing actions. The guidance  is based on research that relates an individual\u2019s functional abilities to  driving performance and reflects the results of a comprehensive  research project carried out in cooperation with the Maryland Motor  Vehicle Administration. Recent research supported under this program  and with NIA grants evaluated a range of screenings related to visual,  physical, and cognitive functions that could be completed at a licensing  agency and may effectively identify drivers at an increased risk of being  involved in a crash.",
      " Physician\u2019s Guide to Assessing and Counseling Older Drivers. Developed by the American Medical Association to raise awareness  among physicians, the guide cites relevant literature and expert views  (as of May 2003) to assist physicians in judging patients\u2019 fitness to drive.  The guide is based on NHTSA\u2019s earlier work with the Association for the  Advancement of Automotive Medicine. This work\u2014a detailed literature  review\u2014summarized knowledge about various categories of medical  conditions, their prevalence, and their potential impact on driving  ability.

NIA is supporting research on several fronts in studying  risk factors for older drivers and in developing new tools for driver  training and driver fitness assessment. A computer-based training tool is being developed to help older  drivers improve the speed with which they process visual  information.",
      " This tool is a self-administered interactive variation of  validated training techniques that have been shown to improve visual  processing speed. The tool is being designed as a cost-effective  mechanism that can be broadly implemented, at social service  organizations, for example, and made accessible to older drivers. Driving simulators are being studied as a means of testing driving  ability and retraining drivers in a manner that is more reliable and  consistent than on-road testing. Virtual reality driving simulation is a  potentially viable means of testing that could more accurately  identify cognitive and motor impairments than could on-road tests  that are comparatively less safe and more subjective.",
      " Research is ongoing to evaluate the impacts of hearing loss on  cognitive functions in situations, such as driving, that require  multitasking. Results of the research may provide insights into what  level of auditory processing is needed for safe driving and may lead  to development of future auditory screening tools. Studies that combine a battery of cognitive function and road/driving  simulator tests are being conducted to learn how age-related changes  lead to hazardous driving.  Results of these studies may prove useful  in developing screening tests to identify functionally-impaired  drivers\u2014particularly those with dementia\u2014who are at risk of being  involved in a crash and may be unfit to drive.",
      " NHTSA is also developing guidelines to assist states in implementing  assessment practices. To date, NHTSA\u2019s research and model programs have  had limited impact on state licensing practices. For example, according to  NHTSA, no state has implemented the guidelines outlined in its Model  Driver Screening and Evaluation Program. Furthermore, there is  insufficient evidence on the validity and reliability of driving assessments,  so states may have difficulty discerning which assessments to implement.  To assist states in implementing assessment practices, NHTSA, as  authorized under SAFETEA-LU section 2017, developed a plan to, among  other things,",
      " (1) provide information and guidelines to people (medical  providers, licensing personnel, law enforcement officers) who can  influence older drivers and (2) improve the scientific basis for licensing  decisions. In its plan NHTSA notes that the most important work on older  driver safety that needs to occur in the next 5 years is refining screening  and assessment tools and getting them into the hands of the users who  need them. As an element of its plan, NHTSA is cooperating with AAMVA to  create a Medical Review Task Force that will identify areas where  standards of practice to assess the driving of at-risk individuals are possible  and develop strategies for implementing guidelines that states can use in  choosing which practices to adopt.",
      " The task force will\u2014in areas such as  vision and cognition\u2014define existing practices used by states and identify  gaps in research to encourage consensus on standards. NHTSA officials  said that work is currently under way to develop neurological guidelines\u2014 which will cover issues related to cognitive assessments\u2014and anticipate  that the task force will report its findings in 2008. Selected States Have  Implemented  Coordinating Groups  and Other Initiatives to  Promote Older Driver  Safety Of the six states we visited, five\u2014California, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, and  Michigan\u2014 have active multidisciplinary coordination groups that may  include government,",
      " medical, academic, and social service representatives,  among others, to develop strategies and implement efforts to improve older  driver safety. Each of these states identified its coordination group as a  key initiative in improving older driver safety. As shown in table 4, the  coordinating groups originated in different ways and vary in size and  structure. For example, Florida\u2019s At-Risk Driver Council was formally  established under state legislation while Maryland\u2019s group functions on an  ad hoc basis with no statutory authority. The approaches taken by these  groups in addressing older driver safety issues vary as well. For example,  California\u2019s large task force broadly reaches several state agencies and  partner organizations,",
      " and the task force leaders oversee the activity of  eight work groups in implementing multiple action items to improve older  driver safety. In contrast, Iowa\u2019s Older Driver Target Area Team is a smaller  group that operates through informal partnerships among member  agencies and is currently providing consulting services to the Iowa  Department of Transportation on the implementation of older driver  strategies identified in Iowa\u2019s Comprehensive Highway Safety Plan. Members of the coordination groups we spoke with said that their state  could benefit from information about other states\u2019 practices. For example,  coordinating group members told us that sharing information about leading  road design and licensing practices, legislative initiatives, research efforts,",
      "  and model training programs that affect older drivers could support  decisions about whether to implement new practices. Furthermore, group  members said that identifying the research basis for practices could help  them assess the benefits to be derived from implementing a particular  practice. While some mechanisms exist to facilitate information exchanges  on some topics, such as driver fitness assessment and licensing through  AAMVA\u2019s Web site, there is no mechanism for states to share information  on the broad range of efforts related to older driver safety. In addition to coordinating groups, the six states have ongoing efforts to  improve older driver safety in the areas of strategic planning, education  and awareness,",
      " licensing and driver fitness assessment, engineering, and  data analysis. The following examples highlight specific initiatives and  leading practices in each of these categories. Strategic planning\u2014Planning documents establish recommended actions  and provide guidance to stakeholders on ways to improve older driver  safety. The Michigan Senior Mobility Action Plan, issued in November 2006,  builds upon the state\u2019s 1999 plan (Elderly Mobility & Safety\u2014The  Michigan Approach) and outlines additional strategies, discusses  accomplishments, and sets action plans in the areas of planning,  research, education and awareness, engineering countermeasures,  alternative transportation, housing and land use,",
      " and licensing designed  to (1) reduce the number and severity of crashes involving older drivers  and pedestrians, (2) increase the scope and effectiveness of alternative  transportation options available to older people, (3) assist older people  in maintaining mobility safely for as long as possible, and (4) plan for a  day when driving may no longer be possible. In implementing this plan,  officials are exploring the development of a community-based resource  center that seniors can use to find information on mobility at a local  level. Traffic Safety among Older Adults: Recommendations for  California\u2014developed through a grant from California\u2019s Office of  Traffic Safety and published in August 2002\u2014offers a comprehensive set  of recommendations and provides guidance to help agencies and  communities reduce traffic-related injuries and fatalities to older adults.",
      "  The Older Californian Traffic Safety Task Force was subsequently  established to coordinate the implementation of the report\u2019s  recommendations. Education/awareness\u2014Education and public awareness initiatives enable  outreach to stakeholders interested in promoting older driver safety. Florida GrandDriver\u00ae\u2014based on a program developed by AAMVA\u2014 takes a multifaceted approach to public outreach through actions such  as providing Web-based information related to driver safety courses and  alternative transportation; training medical, social service and  transportation professionals; offering safety talks at senior centers; and  sponsoring CarFit events. According to the Florida Department of  Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, a total of 75 training programs and  outreach events were conducted under the GrandDriver program  between 2000 and 2006.",
      " California\u2014through its Older Californian Traffic Safety Task Force\u2014 annually holds a \u201cSenior Safe Mobility Summit\u201d that brings subject- matter experts and recognized leaders together to discuss issues and  heighten public understanding of long-term commitments needed to  help older adults drive safely longer. Assessment/licensing\u2014Assessment and licensing initiatives are concerned  with developing better means for stakeholders\u2014license administrators,  medical professionals, law enforcement officers, family members\u2014to  determine driver fitness and provide remedial assistance to help older  people remain safe while driving. California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles is continuing to develop a  progressive \u201cthree-tier\u201d system for determining drivers\u2019 wellness\u2014 through nondriving assessments in the first two tiers\u2014and estimating  driving fitness in a third-tier road test designed to assess the driver\u2019s  ability to compensate for driving-relevant functional limitations identified in the first two tiers.",
      " The system, currently being tested at  limited locations, is being developed to keep people driving safely for as  long as possible by providing a basis for a conditional licensing program  that can aid drivers in improving their driving-relevant functioning and  in adequately compensating for their limitations. Oregon requires physicians and other designated medical providers to  report drivers with severe and uncontrollable cognitive or functional  impairments that affect the person\u2019s ability to drive safely. Oregon  Driver and Motor Vehicle Services (ODMVS) evaluates each report and  determines if immediate suspension of driving privileges is necessary. A  person whose driving privileges have been suspended needs to obtain  medical clearance and pass ODMVS vision,",
      " knowledge, and road tests in  order to have his or her driving privileges reinstated. In cases where  driving privileges are not immediately suspended, people will normally  be given between 30 and 60 days to pass ODMVS tests or provide  medical evidence indicating that the reported condition does not  present a risk to their safe driving. Maryland was the first state to establish a Medical Advisory Board  (MAB)\u2014created by state legislation in 1947\u2014which is currently one of  the most active boards in the United States. Maryland\u2019s MAB manages  approximately 6000 cases per year\u2014most involving older drivers.  Drivers are referred from a number of sources\u2014including physicians,",
      "  law enforcement officers, friends, and relatives\u2014and the MAB reviews  screening results, physician reports, and driving records among other  information to determine driving fitness. The MAB\u2019s opinion is then  considered by Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicle Administration in making  licensing decisions. The Iowa Department of Motor Vehicles can issue older drivers  restricted licenses that limit driving to daylight hours, specific  geographic areas, or low-speed roads. Restricted licensing, also referred  to as \u201cgraduated de-licensing,\u201d seeks to preserve the driver\u2019s mobility  while protecting the health of the driver, passengers, and others on the  road by limiting driving to low risk situations.",
      " About 9,000 older drivers  in Iowa have restricted licenses. Iowa license examiners may travel to  test older drivers in their home towns, where they feel most comfortable  driving. Engineering\u2014Road design elements such as those recommended by  FHWA are implemented to provide a driving environment that  accommodates older drivers\u2019 needs. A demonstration program in Michigan, funded through state, county,  and local government agencies, along with AAA Michigan, made low- cost improvements at over 300 high-risk, urban, signalized intersections  in the Detroit area. An evaluation of 30 of these intersections indicated  that the injury rate for older drivers was reduced by more than twice as  much as for drivers aged 25 to 64 years.",
      " The next phase of the program  is development of a municipal tool kit for intersection safety, for use by  municipal leaders and planners, to provide a template for implementing  needed changes within their jurisdictions. The Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) has undertaken several  initiatives in road operations, maintenance, and new construction to  enhance the driving environment for older drivers. Among its several  initiatives, IDOT is  using more durable pavement markings on selected roads and  servicing all pavement markings on a performance-based schedule to  maintain their brightness, adding paved shoulders with the edge line painted in a shoulder  rumble strip to increase visibility and alert drivers when their  vehicles stray from the travel lane,",
      "  converting 4-lane undivided roads to 3-lane roads with a dedicated  left-turn lane to simplify turning movements, encouraging the use of more dedicated left turn indications (arrows)  on traffic signals on high-speed roads,  installing larger street name signs,  replacing warning signs with ones that have a fluorescent yellow  background to increase visibility,   converting to Clearview fonts on Interstate signs for increased sign   demonstrating older driver and pedestrian-friendly enhancements on  a roadway corridor in Des Moines, and   promoting local implementation of roadway improvements to benefit  older drivers by providing training to city and county engineers and  planners. The Transportation Safety Work Group of the Older Californian Traffic  Safety Task Force provided engineering support in updating California\u2019s  highway design and traffic control manuals to incorporate FHWA\u2019s  recommended practices for making travel safer and easier for older  drivers.",
      " Technical experts from the work group coordinated with the  Caltrans design office in reviewing the Caltrans Highway Design  Manual and updating elements related to older driver safety.  Additionally, the work group managed an expedited process to have the  California Traffic Control Devices Committee consider and approve  modifications to signing and pavement marking standards in the  California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices that benefit  older drivers. Data analysis\u2014Developing tools to accurately capture accident data  enables trends to be identified and resources to be directed to remediating  problems. Iowa has a comprehensive data system that connects information from  multiple sources, including law enforcement records (crash reports,",
      "  traffic citations, truck inspection records) and driver license and  registration databases, and can be easily accessed. For example, the  system allows law enforcement officers to electronically access a  person\u2019s driving record and license information at a crash scene and  enter their crash reports into the data system on-scene. Data captured  through this process\u2014including the location of all crashes\u2014is less  prone to error and can be geographically referenced to identify safety  issues. In the case of older driver safety, several universities are utilizing  Iowa crash data in research efforts. For example, University of Northern  Iowa researchers utilized crash data and geospatial analysis to  demonstrate how older driver crash locations could be identified and  how roadway elements could be subsequently modified to improve  safety for older drivers.",
      " University of Iowa researchers have used the  data in behavioral research to study actions of older drivers and learn  where changes in roadway geometrics, signing, or other roadway  elements could assist older drivers with their driving tasks. Also, Iowa  State University\u2019s Center for Transportation Research and Education  (CTRE) has used the data to study a number of older driver crash  characteristics and supports other older driver data analysis research  projects with the Iowa Traffic Safety Data Service. Florida is developing a Mature Driver Database (MDDB) that will collect  several types of data\u2014vision renewal data, crash data, medical review  data\u2014to be accessible through the Department of Highway Safety and  Motor Vehicles (DHSMV)",
      " Web site. According to DHSMV officials, this  database is intended to be used across agencies to facilitate strategic  planning. DHSMV may use the database, for example, to track driver  performance on screenings and analyze the effectiveness of screening  methods. Planned MDDB enhancements include providing links to  additional data sources such as census and insurance databases. Conclusion Older driver safety is not a high-priority issue in most states and, therefore,  receives fewer resources than other safety concerns. However, the aging of  the American population suggests that older driver safety issues will  become more prominent in the future. Some states\u2014with federal  support\u2014have adopted practices to improve the driving environment for  older road users and have implemented assessment practices to support  licensing requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than  requirements for younger drivers.",
      " However, information on the  effectiveness of these practices is limited, and states have been reluctant to  commit resources to initiatives whose effectiveness has not been clearly  demonstrated. Some states have also implemented additional initiatives to  improve older driver safety, such as establishing coordination groups  involving a broad range of stakeholders and developing initiatives in the  areas of strategic planning, education and outreach, assessment and  licensing practices, engineering, and data analysis. NHTSA and FHWA also  have important roles to play in promoting older driver safety, including  conducting and supporting research on standards for the driving  environment and on driver fitness assessment. While states hold differing  views on the importance of older driver safety and have adopted varying  practices to address older driver safety issues,",
      " it is clear that there are  steps that states can take to prepare for the anticipated increase in the  older driver population and simultaneously improve safety for all drivers.  However, state resources are limited, so information on other states\u2019  initiatives or federal efforts to develop standards for the driving  environment and on driver fitness assessment practices could assist states  in implementing improvements for older driver safety. Recommendation for  Executive Action To help states prepare for the substantial increase in the number of older  drivers in the coming years, we recommend that the Secretary of  Transportation direct the FHWA and NHTSA Administrators to implement  a mechanism that would allow states to share information on leading  practices for enhancing the safety of older drivers.",
      " This mechanism could  also include information on other initiatives and guidance, such as FHWA\u2019s  research on the effectiveness of road design practices and NHTSA\u2019s  research on the effectiveness of driver fitness assessment practices.

      " GAO staff who made major contributions to this report are  listed in appendix IV. Objectives, Scope, and Methodology This report addresses (1) what the federal government has done to  promote practices to make roads safer for older drivers and the extent to  which states have implemented those practices, (2) the extent to which  states assess the fitness of older drivers and what support the federal  government has provided, and (3) what initiatives selected states have  implemented to improve the safety of older drivers. To determine what the federal government has done to promote practices  to make roads safer for older drivers, we interviewed officials from the  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)",
      " within the U.S. Department of  Transportation (DOT) and the American Association of State and Highway  Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and reviewed manuals and other  documentation to determine what road design standards and guidelines  have been established, the basis for their establishment, and how they have  been promoted. We also reviewed research and interviewed a  representative of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program  (NCHRP) to gain perspective on federal initiatives to improve the driving  environment for older drivers. Finally, to determine trends in accidents  involving older drivers, we reviewed and analyzed crash data from the U.S.  DOT\u2019s Fatality Analysis Reporting System database and General Estimates  System database.",
      " To obtain information on the extent to which states are implementing these  practices, we surveyed and received responses from DOTs in each of the 50  states and the District of Columbia. We consulted with NCHRP, FHWA, and  AASHTO in developing the survey. The survey was conducted from the end  of September 2006 through mid-January 2007. During this time period, we  sent two waves of follow-up questionnaires to nonrespondents in addition  to the initial mailing. We also made phone calls and sent e-mails to a few  states to remind them to return the questionnaire. We surveyed state DOTs  to learn the extent to which they have incorporated federal government  recommendations on road design elements into their own design guides  and implemented selected recommendations in their construction,",

    "answer": "As people age, their physical, visual, and cognitive abilities may decline, making it more difficult for them to drive safely. Older drivers are also more likely to suffer injuries or die in crashes than drivers in other age groups. These safety issues will increase in significance because older adults represent the fastest-growing U.S. population segment. GAO examined (1) what the federal government has done to promote practices to make roads safer for older drivers and the extent to which states have implemented those practices, (2) the extent to which states assess the fitness of older drivers and what support the federal government has provided, and (3) what initiatives selected states have implemented to improve the safety of older drivers. To conduct this study, GAO surveyed 51 state departments of transportation (DOT), visited six states, and interviewed federal transportation officials. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has recommended practices--such as using larger letters on signs--targeted to making roadways easier for older drivers to navigate. FHWA also provides funding that states may use for projects that address older driver safety. States have, to varying degrees, adopted FHWA's recommended practices. For example, 24 states reported including about half or more of FHWA's practices in state design guides, while the majority of states reported implementing certain FHWA practices in roadway construction, operations, and maintenance activities. States generally do not place high priority on projects that specifically address older driver safety but try to include practices that benefit older drivers in all projects. More than half of the states have implemented licensing requirements for older drivers that are more stringent than requirements for younger drivers, but states' assessment practices are not comprehensive. For example, these practices primarily involve more frequent or in-person renewals and mandatory vision screening but do not generally include assessments of physical and cognitive functions. While requirements for in-person license renewals generally appear to correspond with lower crash rates for drivers over age 85, the validity of other assessment tools is less clear. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is sponsoring research and other initiatives to develop and assist states in implementing more comprehensive driver fitness assessment practices. Five of the six states GAO visited have implemented coordination groups to assemble a broad range of stakeholders to develop strategies and foster efforts to improve older driver safety in areas of strategic planning, education and awareness, licensing and driver fitness assessment, roadway engineering, and data analysis. However, knowledge sharing among states on older driver safety initiatives is limited, and officials said states could benefit from knowledge of other states' initiatives.\n",

    "context": "Introduction On July 20, 1923, the National Woman's Party (NWP) met in Seneca Falls, New York, to commemorate the 75 th anniversary of the historic Seneca Falls Convention and celebrate the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, by which women won the right to vote. At the meeting, NWP leader Alice Paul announced her next project would be to develop and promote a new constitutional amendment, guaranteeing equal rights and equality under the law in the United States to women and men. Paul, a prominent suffragist, noted the recent ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which established the right of women to vote. She characterized an \"equal rights\" amendment as the next logical step for the women's movement. The proposed amendment was first introduced six months later, in December 1923, in the 68 th Congress. Originally named \"the Lucretia Mott Amendment,\" in honor of the prominent 19 th century abolitionist, women's rights activist, and social reformer, the draft amendment stated that, \"men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\"  Nearly half a century passed before the Mott Amendment, as amended and ultimately renamed the Alice Paul Amendment, was approved by Congress and proposed to the states for ratification in 1972. In common with the Eighteenth and Twentieth through Twenty-Sixth Amendments, the proposed ERA included a seven-year deadline for ratification; in this case the deadline was included in the proposing clause, or preamble, that preceded the text of the amendment. After considerable early progress in the states, ratifications slowed, and the process ultimately stalled at 35 states in 1977, 3 short of the 38 approvals (three-fourths of the states) required by the Constitution. As the 1979 deadline approached, however, ERA supporters capitalized on the fact that the seven-year time limit was incorporated in the amendment's proposing clause, rather than in the body of the amendment. Concluding that the amendment itself was, therefore, not time-limited, Congress extended the ratification period by 38 months, through 1982. No further states added their approval during the extension, however, and the proposed ERA appeared to expire in 1982. Since the proposed ERA's extended ratification period expired in 1982, Senators and Representatives have continued to introduce new versions of the amendment, beginning in the 97 th Congress. More recently, new analyses emerged that led ERA supporters to assert that the amendment remains viable, and that the period for its ratification could be extended indefinitely by congressional action. Resolutions embracing this thesis have been introduced beginning in the 112 th Congress. Their stated purpose is that of \"[r]emoving the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.\" If enacted, these measures would eliminate the 1979 and 1982 deadlines; reopen the proposed ERA for state ratification at the present count of 37 states; and extend the period for state ratification indefinitely. This report examines the legislative history of the various proposals that ultimately emerged as the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. It identifies and provides an analysis of current legislative proposals and reviews contemporary factors that may bear on its present and future viability. Most Recent Developments 115th Congress Proposals As the 115 th Congress convened, resolutions were introduced in both the House and Senate that embraced two approaches to the Equal Rights Amendment. These include \"fresh start\" proposals that proposed a new constitutional amendment, separate from the amendment proposed by Congress in 1972 (H.J. Res. 208, 92 nd Congress), and proposals designed to reopen the ratification process by removing the deadline included in the resolution proposing the original ERA.  Fresh Start Proposals Perhaps the most basic means of restarting an equal rights amendment would be by introduction of a new joint resolution, a \"fresh start.\" In 1982, even as the extended ratification deadline for the proposed ERA approached, resolutions proposing a new equal rights amendment were introduced in the 97 th Congress. New versions of the ERA have continued to be introduced in the House and Senate in each succeeding Congress. All have shared language identical or similar to the original proposed by Congress in 1982. Two fresh start amendments have been introduced to date in the 115 th Congress, as detailed below. S.J.Res. 6 The first fresh start ERA proposal to be offered in the 115 th Congress was S.J.Res. 6, introduced by Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey on January 20, 2017. To date, Senator Menendez has been joined by 15 cosponsors. Senator Menendez's proposal incorporates the language of the original ERA, as proposed in the 92 nd Congress: Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Section 2. \u00a0 The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Section 3. This article shall take effect 2 years after the date of ratification. S.J.Res. 6 has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. H.J.Res. 33 H.J.Res. 33 was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York on January 24, 2017. To date, Representative Maloney has been joined by 169 cosponsors. This measure is also a fresh start resolution, proposing a new ERA: Section 1. Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Section 2. Congress and the several States shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification. This version of the amendment includes Section 1 language that differs from the version of the ERA proposed by Congress in 1972. The new wording appeared initially in H.J.Res. 56 in the 113 th Congress. Specifically, Section 1 was amended by the addition of the following clause at its beginning: \"Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\" In a press release issued at the time, Representative Maloney described this as a ... new and improved Equal Rights Amendment.... Today's ERA would prohibit gender discrimination and for the first time, would explicitly mandate equal rights for women.... This ERA is different ... it's designed for the 21 st Century. This ERA expressly puts women in the Constitution for the first time. It may also be noted that this language recalls the wording of the first version of the E R A, as drafted by suffragist Alice Paul in 1923 and introduced in the 68 th Congress in 1923: Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  Further, the resolution expands enforcement authority for the amendment \"by appropriate legislation,\" extending it from Congress to include \"the several States.\" H.J.Res. 33 has been referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary. Discussion  As joint resolutions proposing an amendment to the Constitution, S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res. 33 would require approval in identical form by two-thirds of the Members present and voting in both chambers of Congress. Unlike a standard joint resolution that has the force of law, the President's approval is not necessary for joint resolutions that propose amendments. Both resolutions prescribe that the proposed amendment would be submitted to the legislatures of the states for ratification. Neither S.J.Res. 6 nor H.J.Res. 33 includes a time limit for ratification, either in their preambles, or in the body of the amendment. While a ratification deadline has been included in either the preamble or the text of the 18 th and 20 th through 26 th Amendments, it is a tradition dating to the early 20 th century, rather than a constitutional requirement. If Congress were to propose either of these resolutions to the states as a constitutional amendment, they would arguably be eligible for ratification indefinitely. In not setting a ratification deadline, these measures thus avoid the expiration issues associated with the original proposed Equal Rights Amendment. They also arguably embrace the assumption under which the 27 th Amendment was ratified in 1992, some 203 years after Congress sent it to the states for approval: proposed amendments remain constitutionally valid and eligible for ratification unless a deadline is specifically prescribed when the amendment is proposed. Opponents, however, might argue that the seven-year ratification deadline first included in the 18 th Amendment should not be lightly discarded. The inclusion of a \"sunset\" provision on proposed amendments, they might argue, is necessary to ensure that a contemporaneous majority of the people, and through them the state legislatures, favors the measure. This issue is examined at greater length later in this report.  Removing the ERA Ratification Deadline: The \"Three-State Strategy\" Two resolutions introduced in the 115 th Congress, one each in the House and Senate, are designed to reopen the ratification process for H.J. Res. 208, the Equal Rights Amendment proposed by the 92 nd Congress in 1972, and extend it indefinitely by removing the deadline set in the preamble to the proposed ERA. Both these measures are based on the \"three-state\" argument that (1) Congress has the constitutional authority to propose, alter, or terminate any limits on the ratification of amendments pending before the states; (2) all existing ratifications remain in effect and viable; and (3) rescissions of ratification passed by some states are invalid. The three-state argument is examined in detail later in this report. S.J.Res. 5 This resolution, designed to reopen the ERA ratification process, was introduced by Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland on January 17, 2017. To date, Senator Cardin has been joined by 36 cosponsors. The purpose of the resolution, as stated in its title is \"[r]emoving the deadline for ratification of the equal rights amendment.\" The text of the resolution states: [t]hat notwithstanding any time limit contained in House Joint Resolution 208, 92d Congress, as agreed to in the Senate on March 22, 1972, the article of amendment proposed to the States in that joint resolution shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution whenever ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States. S.J.Res. 5 has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. H.J.Res. 53 This resolution was introduced by Representative Jackie Speier of California on January 31, 2017. To date, Representative Speier has been joined by 166 co-sponsors. The text of H.J.Res. 53 is identical to that of S.J.Res. 5. H.J.Res. 53 has been referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary. Discussion Many ERA proponents claim that because the amendment as originally proposed by Congress in 1972 did not include a ratification deadline within the amendment text , it remains potentially viable and eligible for ratification indefinitely. They maintain that Congress possesses the authority both to remove the original 1979 ratification deadline and its 1982 extension, and to restart the ratification clock at the then-current 36-state level, with or without a future ratification deadline. In support, they assert that Article V of the Constitution gives Congress uniquely broad authority over the amendment process. They further cite the Supreme Court's decisions in Dillon v. Glo ss and Coleman v. Miller in support of their position. They also note the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh \"Madison\" Amendment, which was ratified in 1992, 203 years after Congress proposed it to the states. These issues are examined more fully later in this report. Recent Activity in the State Legislatures: Nevada and Illinois  Although the ratification deadline for the proposed ERA expired in 1982, its proponents have continued to press for action in the legislatures of states that either failed to ratify it, or had previously rejected the amendment. Recent notable developments in the states include action by Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018 to ratify the amendment. Also in 2018, however, proposals to ratify the ERA failed to reach the floor of state legislatures in both Arizona and Virginia, although supporters in the North Carolina Legislature assert the amendment may come to a vote in that state's legislature during the current session. Nevada and Illinois Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment The most widely-publicized recent ERA developments in the states occurred in March 2017, and May 2018, when Nevada and Illinois ratified the proposed amendment. Their actions raised the number of state ratifications to 37. On March 22, 2017, the Nevada Legislature completed action on a resolution approving the ERA as proposed by H.J.Res. 208 in the 92 nd Congress. With this action, Nevada became the 36 th state to ratify the ERA, and the first state to do so since 1977. The ratification measure, introduced on February 17 as Senate Joint Resolution 2, (SJR2), passed the Nevada Senate on March 1 and the Nevada House of Representatives on March 20. The Senate's concurrence with a House amendment on March 22 completed the ratification process. The choice of dates had historical significance: H.J.Res. 208 was proposed by Congress on March 22, 1972, exactly 45 years earlier. Press accounts of the action noted that the ratification marked a reversal of earlier actions in Nevada. Efforts to secure ERA ratification in the legislature failed three times in the 1970s and failed once when placed on the ballot as an advisory ballot issue in 1978. With Nevada's ratification, the three-state strategy arguably changed to a \"two-state strategy,\" and the legislature's action was reported as \"being read by [ERA] supporters as an encouraging sign,\" while the Eagle Forum, an advocacy group historically opposed to ERA, restated its criticism of the amendment, noting the deadline for ratification had been passed in 1982. On May 30, 2018, the Illinois legislature completed action on a resolution approving the ERA as proposed by H.J.Res. 208 in the 92 nd Congress. With this action Illinois became the 37 th state to ratify the amendment. The ratification measure, introduced as SJRCA (Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 0004) on February 7, 2018, was adopted by the Senate as originally introduced on April 11 and in its final form by the Senate and House of Representatives on May 30. The governor's approval was not required. Contemporary Public Attitudes toward the Equal Rights Amendment Public opinion polls showed support through the 1990s for an equal rights amendment. The first recorded survey on support for the proposal was a CBS News telephone poll conducted in September 1970, in which 56% of respondents approved of an equal rights amendment. Favorable attitudes remained steady in the 1970s and throughout the subsequent ratification period, during which time levels of support as reported by the Gallup Poll never dropped below 57%. A later ERA-specific survey conducted by CBS News in 1999 reported that 74% of respondents supported the proposed ERA, while 10% were opposed. The ERA's expiration as a pending constitutional amendment was eventually followed by corresponding fall-off in related polling; there is little evidence of related activity by major survey research organizations after 1999, a development that is arguably due to the fact that the ERA was presumed to be a closed issue.  More recently, in 2017, the Harris Survey conducted a poll on women's status in American society. While it did not include a specific question concerning the ERA, the Harris Survey included the following query: \"There has been much talk recently about changing women's status in society today. On the whole, do you favor or oppose most of the efforts to strengthen and change women's status in society?\" Sixty-six percent of respondents favored strengthening and changing women's status in society, 7% were opposed, and 27% were not sure.  An Equal Rights Amendment: Legislative and Ratification History, 1923-1972 Despite the efforts of women's rights advocates in every Congress, nearly 50 years passed between the time when the Mott Amendment was first introduced in 1923 and the Equal Rights Amendment was approved by Congress and proposed to the states in 1972. Five Decades of Effort: Building Support for an Equal Rights Amendment in Congress, 1923-1970 The first proposal for an equal rights amendment, drafted by Alice Paul, was introduced in the 68 th Congress in 1923. In its original form, the text of the amendment read as follows: Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Although Alice Paul characterized the then-Lucretia Mott Amendment as a logical and necessary next step in the campaign for women's rights following the Nineteenth Amendment, the proposal made little progress in Congress over the course of more than two decades. During the years following its first introduction, an equal rights amendment was the subject of hearings in either the House or Senate in almost every Congress. According to one study, the proposal was the subject of committee action, primarily hearings, on 32 occasions between 1923 and 1946, but it came to the floor for the first time\u2014in the Senate\u2014only in the latter year. During this period, however, the proposal continued to evolve. In 1943, for instance, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a version of an equal rights amendment incorporating revised language that remained unchanged until 1971: Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress and the several states shall have power, within their respective jurisdictions, to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Throughout this period, amendment proponents faced opposition from traditionalists, organized labor, and some leaders of the women's movement. According to one study of the amendment's long pendency in Congress, \"[t]he most persistent and most compelling trouble that crippled prospects for an ERA from its introduction in 1923 until a year after Congress initially passed it on to the states was opposition from most of organized labor during a period of ascending labor strength.\" A principal objection raised by organized labor and women's organizations that opposed the amendment was concern that the ERA might lead to the loss of protective legislation for women, particularly with respect to wages, hours, and working conditions. One historian notes that: Through the years of the New Deal and the Truman administration, however, protective legislation for women held a firm place in organized labor's list of policy favorites. Since an ERA threatened protective laws, it and its supporters qualified as the enemy. The nature of opposition from women's groups was illustrated by a 1946 statement issued by 10 prominent figures, including former Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, which asserted that an equal rights amendment would \"make it possible to wipe out the legislation which has been enacted in many states for the special needs of women in industry.\" These attitudes toward the proposal persisted, even as women in great numbers entered the civilian workforce and the uniformed services during the four years of U.S. involvement in World War II (1941-1945), taking jobs in government, industry, and the service sector that had previously been filled largely by men. Congressional support for an equal rights amendment grew slowly in the late 1940s, but a proposal eventually came to the Senate floor, where it was the subject of debate and a vote in July 1946. Although the 39-35 vote to approve fell short of the two-thirds of Senators present and voting required by the Constitution, it was a symbolic first step. The so-called Hayden rider, named for its author, Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona, was perhaps emblematic of the arguments ERA advocates faced during the early post-war era. First introduced during the Senate's 1950 debate, this proposal stated that: The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions conferred by law upon persons of the female sex. Although the rider's ostensible purpose was to safeguard protective legislation, one source suggested an ulterior motive: \"Hayden deliberately added the riders in order to divide the amendment's supporters, and these tactics delayed serious consideration of the unamended version of the Equal Rights Amendment.\" Whatever the rider's intent, it was not welcomed by ERA supporters, and was opposed on the floor by Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, at that time the only woman Senator.  The Senate ultimately passed an equal rights amendment resolution that included the Hayden rider twice in the 1950s. In the 81 st Congress, S.J. Res. 25, introduced by Senator Guy Gillette of Iowa and numerous co-sponsors, was approved by a vote of 63-19 on January 25, 1950, a margin that comfortably surpassed the two-thirds of Members present and voting required by the Constitution. An amendment came before the Senate again in the 83 rd Congress, when Senator John M. Butler of Maryland and co-sponsors introduced S.J. Res. 49. The resolution, as amended by the Hayden rider, passed by a vote of 73-11 on July 16, 1953. Over the next 16 years, the Senate considered various equal rights amendment resolutions in committee in almost every session, but no proposal was considered on the floor during this period. By 1964, however, the Hayden rider had lost support in the Senate as perceptions of the equal rights amendment concept continued to evolve. In the 88 th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee effectively removed it from future consideration when it stated in its report:  Your committee has considered carefully the amendment which was added to this proposal on the floor of the Senate.... Its effect was to preserve \"rights, benefits, or exemptions\" conferred by law upon persons of the female sex. This qualification is not acceptable to women who want equal rights under the law. It is under the guise of so-called \"rights\" or \"benefits\" that women have been treated unequally and denied opportunities which are available to men. Between 1948 and 1970, however, the House of Representatives took no action on an equal rights amendment. Throughout this period, Representative Emanuel Celler of New York had blocked consideration of the amendment in the Judiciary Committee, which he chaired from 1949 to 1953 and again from 1955 to 1973. A Member of the House since 1923, Chairman Celler had been a champion of New Deal social legislation, immigration reform, civil rights legislation, and related measures throughout his career, but his strong connections with organized labor, which, as noted earlier, opposed an equal rights amendment during this period, may have influenced his attitudes toward the proposal. Congress Approves and Proposes the Equal Rights Amendment, 1970-1972 Although proposals for an equal rights constitutional amendment continued to be introduced in every Congress, there was no floor consideration of any proposal by either chamber for almost two decades following the Senate's 1953 action. By the early 1970s, however, the concept had gained increasing visibility as one of the signature issues of the emerging women's movement in the United States. As one eyewitness participant later recounted: The 1960s brought a revival of the women's rights movement and more insistence on changed social and legal rights and responsibilities. The fact of women's involvement in the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement and their changed role in the economy created a social context in which many women became active supporters of enhanced legislation for themselves. By the time the concept of an equal rights amendment emerged as a national issue, it had also won popular support, as measured by public opinion polling. As noted earlier in this report, the first recorded survey on support for the proposal was a CBS News telephone poll conducted in September 1970, in which 56% of respondents favored an equal rights amendment. Favorable attitudes remained consistent during the 1970s and throughout the subsequent ratification period. Labor opposition also began to fade, and in April 1970, one of the nation's largest and most influential unions, the United Auto Workers, voted to endorse the concept of an equal rights amendment. In actions that perhaps reflected changing public attitudes, Congress had also moved during the 1960s on several related fronts to address women's equality issues. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 \"prohibited discrimination on account of sex in payment of wages,\" while the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex , or national origin [emphasis added]. Although it remained pending, but unacted upon in Congress, proposals for an equal rights amendment had gained support in other areas. The Republican Party had endorsed an earlier version of the amendment in its presidential platform as early as 1940, followed by the Democratic Party in 1944. Both parties continued to include endorsements in their subsequent quadrennial platforms, and, by 1970, Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon were all on record as having endorsed an equal rights amendment. First Vote in the House, 91st Congress\u20141970 Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan is widely credited with breaking the legislative stalemate that had blocked congressional action on a series of equal rights amendment proposals for more than two decades. Against the background of incremental change outside Congress, Representative Griffiths moved to end the impasse in House consideration of the amendment. On January 16, 1969, she introduced H.J. Res. 264, proposing an equal rights amendment, in the House of Representatives. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee where, as had been expected, no further action was taken. On June 11, 1970, however, Representative Griffiths took the unusual step of filing a discharge petition to bring the proposed amendment to the floor. A discharge petition \"allows a measure to come to the floor for consideration, even if the committee of referral does not report it and the leadership does not schedule it.\" In order for a House committee to be discharged from further consideration of a measure, a majority of Representatives (218, if there are no vacancies) must sign the petition . As reported at the time, the use of the discharge petition had seldom been invoked successfully, having gained the necessary support only 24 times since the procedure had been established by the House of Representatives in 1910, and Representative Griffiths' filing in 1970. By June 20, Representative Griffiths announced that she had obtained the necessary 218 Member signatures for the petition. Although the Judiciary Committee had neither scheduled hearings nor issued a report, the resolution was brought to the House floor on August 10. The House approved the motion to discharge by a vote of 332 to 22, and approved the amendment itself by a vote of 334 to 26.  The Senate had begun to act on a resolution proposing an equal rights amendment in the 91 st Congress in 1970, before the amendment came to the House floor. In May, the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments held hearings on S.J.Res. 61, the Senate version of an amendment. These hearings were followed by hearings in the full committee in September, and consideration on the Senate floor in early October. Floor debate was dominated by consideration and adoption of two amendments that would have (1) exempted women from compulsory military service, and (2) permitted non-denominational prayer in public schools; and a final amendment that provided alternative language for the resolution. Thus encumbered, the Senate resolution was unacceptable to ERA supporters, but, in any event, the Senate adjourned on October 14 without a vote on the resolution as amended, and failed to bring it to the floor for final action in the subsequent lame-duck session. Passage and Proposal by Congress, 92nd Congress\u20141971-1972 In the 92 nd Congress, Representative Griffiths began the process anew in the House of Representatives when she introduced H.J.Res. 208, proposing an equal rights amendment. Chairman Celler continued to oppose it, but no longer blocked committee action. After subcommittee and full committee hearings, the House Judiciary Committee reported an amendment on July 14, but the resolution as reported included amendments concerning citizenship, labor standards, and the exemption of women from selective service that were unacceptable to ERA supporters. When H.J.Res. 208 came to the floor in early October, however, the House stripped out the committee amendments, and, on October 12, it approved the resolution by a bipartisan vote of 354 to 24. The Senate took up the House-passed amendment during the second session of the 92 nd Congress, in March 1972. On March 14, the Judiciary Committee reported a clean version of H.J. Res. 208 after rejecting several amendments, including one adopted by the Subcommittee on the Constitution, and several others offered in the full committee. The resolution was called up on March 15, and immediately set aside. The Senate began debate on the amendment on March 17, with Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a longtime ERA supporter, as floor manager. On the same day, President Richard Nixon released a letter to Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania reaffirming his endorsement of the Equal Rights Amendment. After two days in which the Members debated the proposal, Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina offered a series of amendments that, among other things, would have exempted women from compulsory military service and service in combat units in the U.S. Armed Forces, and preserved existing gender-specific state and federal legislation that extended special exemptions or protections to women. Over the course of two days, Senator Ervin's amendments were serially considered and rejected, generally by wide margins. On March 22, the Senate approved the House version of the amendment, H.J. Res. 208, by a vote of 84 to 8, with strong bipartisan support. The text of H.J. Res. 208\u2014the Equal Rights Amendment as proposed by the 92 nd Congress\u2014follows: House Joint Resolution 208 Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and women. Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), That  The following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years of its submission by the Congress: \"Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex. \"Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. \"Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.\" The action of the two chambers in approving H.J. Res. 208 by two-thirds majorities of Members present and voting (91.3% in the Senate and 93.4% in the House) had the effect of formally proposing the amendment to the states for ratification. Congress Sets a Seven-Year Ratification Deadline When it proposed the Equal Rights Amendment, Congress stipulated in the preamble of the joint resolution that the ERA was to be ratified by the constitutionally requisite number of state legislatures (38 then as now) within seven years of the time it was proposed, in order to become a valid part of the Constitution. A time limit for ratification was first instituted with the Eighteenth Amendment, proposed in 1917, and, with the exception of the Nineteenth Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment, all subsequent proposed amendments have included a ratification deadline of seven years. With respect to the Child Labor Amendment, Congress did not incorporate a ratification deadline when it proposed the amendment in 1924. It was ultimately ratified by 28 states through 1937, 8 short of the 36 required by the Constitution at that time, the Union then comprising 48 states. Although the amendment arguably remains technically viable because it lacked a deadline when proposed, the Supreme Court in 1941 upheld federal authority to regulate child labor as incorporated in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (52 Stat. 1060) in the case of United States v. Darby Lumber Company (312 U.S. 100 (1941)). In this case, the Court reversed its earlier decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart (24 U.S. 251 (1918)), which ruled that the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 675) was unconstitutional. The amendment is thus widely regarded as having been rendered moot by the Court's 1941 decision. In the case of the Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-First, and Twenty-Second Amendments, the \"sunset\" ratification provision was incorporated in the body of the amendment itself . For subsequent amendments, however, Congress determined that inclusion of the time limit within its body \"cluttered up\" the proposal. Consequently, all but one of the subsequently proposed amendments \u2014the Twenty-Third, Twenty-Fourth, Twenty-Fifth and Twenty-Sixth, and the ERA\u2014placed the limit in the preamble or authorizing resolution , rather than in the body of the amendment itself . This decision, seemingly uncontroversial at the time, was later to have profound implications for the question of extending the ratification window for the ERA. Ratification Efforts in the States States initially responded quickly once Congress proposed the Equal Rights Amendment for their consideration. Hawaii was the first state to ratify, on March 22, 1972, the same day the Senate completed action on H.J. Res. 208. By the end of 1972, 22 states had ratified the amendment, and it seemed well on its way to adoption. Opposition to the amendment, however, began to coalesce around organizations like \"STOP ERA,\" which revived many of the arguments addressed during congressional debate. Opponents also broadly asserted that ratification of the amendment would set aside existing state and local laws providing workplace and other protections for women and would lead to other, unanticipated negative social and economic effects. In 1976, ERA supporters established a counter-organization, \"ERAmerica,\" as an umbrella association to coordinate the efforts of pro-amendment groups and serve as a high-profile national advocate for the amendment. Opposition to the proposed Equal Rights Amendment continued to gain strength, although, as noted earlier in this report, public approval of the amendment never dropped below 54% during the ratification period. Following the first 22 state approvals, 8 additional states ratified in 1973, 3 more in 1974, and 1 each in 1975 and 1977, for an ultimate total of 35, 3 short of the constitutional requirement of 38 state ratifications. At the same time, however, ERA opponents in the states promoted measures in a number of legislatures to repeal or rescind their previous ratifications. Although the constitutionality of such actions has long been questioned, by 1979, five states had passed rescission measures. The question of rescission will be addressed in detail later in this report. Ratification Is Extended in 1978, but Expires in 1982 By the late 1970s, the ratification process had clearly stalled, and the deadline for ratification as specified in the preamble to H.J. Res. 208 was approaching. Reacting to the impending \"sunset\" date of March 22, 1979, ERA supporters developed a novel strategy to extend the deadline by congressional resolution. The vehicle chosen by congressional supporters was a House joint resolution, H.J.Res. 638 , introduced in the 95 th Congress on October 26, 1977, by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of New York and others. In its original form, the resolution proposed to extend the deadline an additional seven years, thus doubling the original ratification period.  During hearings in the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, legal scholars debated questions on the authority of Congress to extend the deadline; whether an extension vote should be by a simple majority or a supermajority of two-thirds of the Members present and voting; and if state rescissions of their ratifications were lawful. The full Judiciary Committee also addressed these issues during its deliberations in 1978. Continuing controversy in the committee and opposition to extending the ratification period a full seven years led to a compromise amendment to the resolution that reduced the proposed extension to three years, three months, and eight days. ERA supporters accepted the shorter period as necessary to assure committee approval of the extension. Two other changes, one that would have recognized the right of states to rescind their ratifications, and a second requiring passage of the extension in the full House by a two-thirds super majority, were both rejected by the committee when it reported the resolution to the House on July 30. The full House debated the resolution during summer 1978, rejecting an amendment that proposed to recognize states' efforts to rescind their instruments of ratification. Another amendment rejected on the floor would have required votes on the ERA deadline extension to pass by the same two-thirds vote necessary for original actions proposing constitutional amendments. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 233 to 189 on August 15, 1978. The Senate took up H.J.Res. 638 in October; during its deliberations it rejected amendments similar to those offered in the House and joined the House in adopting the resolution, in this case by a vote of 60 to 36 on October 6. In an unusual expression of support, President Jimmy Carter signed the joint resolution on October 20, even though the procedure of proposing an amendment to the states is solely a congressional prerogative under the Constitution. During the extended ratification period, ERA supporters sought unsuccessfully to secure the three necessary ratifications for the amendment, while opponents pursued rescission in the states with similarly unsuccessful results. A Gallup Poll reported in August 1981 that 63% of respondents supported the amendment, a higher percentage than in any previous survey, but, as one observer noted, \"The positive poll results were really negative, because additional ratifications needed to come from the states in which support was identified as weakest.\" On June 30, 1982, the Equal Rights Amendment deadline expired with the number of state ratifications at 35, not counting rescissions. Rescission: A Legal Challenge to the Ratification Process As noted earlier, while ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment was pending, a number of states passed resolutions that sought to rescind their earlier ratifications. By the time the amendment's extended ratification deadline passed in 1982, the legislatures of more than 17 states had considered rescission, and 5 passed these resolutions. Throughout the period, however, legal opinion as to the constitutionality of rescission remained divided. On May 9, 1979, the state of Idaho, joined by the state of Arizona and individual members of the Washington legislature, brought legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, asserting that states did have the right to rescind their instruments of ratification. The plaintiffs further asked that the extension enacted by Congress be declared null and void. On December 23, 1981, District Court Judge Marion Callister ruled (1) that Congress had exceeded its power by extending the deadline from March 22, 1979, to June 30, 1982; and (2) that states had the authority to rescind their instruments of ratification, provided they took this action before an amendment was declared to be an operative part of the Constitution. The National Organization for Women (NOW), the largest ERA advocacy organization, and the General Services Administration (GSA) appealed this decision directly to the Supreme Court, which, on January 25, 1982, consolidated four appeals and agreed to hear the cases. In its order, the High Court also stayed the judgment of the Idaho District Court. On June 30, as noted earlier, the extended ratification deadline expired, so that when the Supreme Court convened for its term on October 4, it dismissed the appeals as moot, and vacated the district court decision. Renewed Legislative and Constitutional Proposals, 1982 to the Present Interest in the proposed Equal Rights Amendment did not end when its extended ratification deadline expired on June 30, 1982. Since that time, there have been regular efforts to introduce the concept as a \"fresh start\" in Congress, while additional approaches have emerged that would revive H.J. Res. 208, the amendment as originally proposed by the 92 nd Congress. \"Fresh Start\" Proposals One potential means of restarting an equal rights amendment would be by introduction of a new joint resolution, a \"fresh start.\" Even as the June 30, 1982, extended ratification deadline approached, resolutions proposing an equal rights amendment were introduced in the 97 th Congress. New versions of an ERA have continued to be introduced in the House and Senate in each succeeding Congress. For many years, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts customarily introduced an equal rights amendment early in the first session of a newly convened Congress; since the 111 th Congress, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey has introduced Senate fresh start proposals. In the House of Representatives, Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York introduced a fresh start equal rights amendment in the 105 th and all succeeding Congresses. Fresh start amendments introduced in the 115 th Congress, S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res. 33 , were discussed earlier in this report, under \"Most Recent Developments.\" \"Three-State\" Proposals In addition to \"fresh start\" proposals, alternative approaches to the ratification question have also emerged over the years. In 1994, Representative Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey introduced H.Res. 432 in the 103 rd Congress. His proposal sought to require the House of Representatives to \"take any legislative action necessary to verify the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment as part of the Constitution when the legislatures of an additional 3 states ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\" This resolution was a response to the three-state strategy proposed by a pro-ERA volunteer organization \"ERA Summit\" in the 1990s, which was called following adoption of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, the Madison Amendment, in 1992. The rationale for H.Res. 432 , and a succession of identical resolutions offered by Representative Andrews in subsequent Congresses, was that, following the precedent of the Madison Amendment, the ERA remained a valid proposal and the ratification process was still open. Representative Andrews further asserted that the action of Congress in extending the ERA deadline in 1978 provided a precedent by which \"subsequent sessions of Congress may adjust time limits placed in proposing clauses by their predecessors. These adjustments may include extensions of time, reductions, or elimination of the deadline altogether.\" The influence of the Madison Amendment is examined at greater length later in this report. The year 2012 marked the 30 th anniversary of the expiration of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment's extended ratification deadline. During that period, new analyses emerged that examined the question of whether the amendment proposed in 1972 remains constitutionally viable. As noted later in this report, one of the most influential developments opening new lines of analysis occurred when the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, originally proposed in 1789 as part of a package that included the Bill of Rights, was taken up in the states after more than two centuries and ultimately ratified in 1992. This action, and Congress's subsequent acknowledgment of the amendment's viability, bear directly on the issue of the current status of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and are examined later in this report. In the 112 th Congress, for the first time since the proposed ERA's deadline expired, resolutions were introduced in both the House and Senate that sought specifically to (1) repeal, or eliminate entirely, the deadlines set in 1972 and 1978; (2) reopen the proposed ERA for state ratification at the then-current count of 35 states; and (3) extend the period for state ratification indefinitely. Current legislation proposing the three state/two state strategy in the 115 th Congress, S.J.Res. 5 and H.J.Res. 53 were discussed earlier in this report, under \"Most Recent Developments.\" Contemporary Viability of the Equal Rights Amendment Supporters of the ERA, and particularly the three-state strategy\u2014now, arguably, the one-state strategy, assuming the validity of ratifications by Nevada and Illinois\u2014identify a number of sources that they claim support their contention that the proposed Equal Rights Amendment remains constitutionally viable. Other scholars and observers, however, have raised concerns about, or objections to, these assertions. Article V: Congressional Authority over the Amendment Process Proponents of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment cite the exceptionally broad authority over the constitutional amendment process granted to Congress by Article V of the Constitution as a principal argument for their case. The article's language states that \"[t]he Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution ... which ... shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States or by Conventions in three fourths thereof....\" While the Constitution is economical with words when spelling out the authority extended to the three branches of the federal government, it does speak specifically when it places limits on these powers. In this instance, the founders placed no time limits or other conditions on congressional authority to propose amendments, so long as they are approved by the requisite two-thirds majority of Senators and Representatives present and voting. In a 1992 opinion for the Counsel to the President concerning ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, Acting Assistant Attorney General Timothy Flanigan took note of the absence of time limits in Article V, and drew a comparison with their presence in other parts of the Constitution: ... [t]he rest of the Constitution strengthens the presumption that when time periods are part of a constitutional rule, they are specified. For example, Representatives are elected every second year ... and a census must be taken within every ten year period following the first census, which was required to be taken within three years of the first meeting of Congress..... Neither House of Congress may adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other ... and the President has ten days (Sundays excepted) within which to sign or veto a bill that has been presented to him.... The Twentieth Amendment refers to certain specific dates, January 3 rd and 20 th . Again, if the Framers had intended there to be a time limit for the ratification process, we would expect that they would have so provided in Article V. Further, Article V empowers Congress to specify either of two modes of ratification: by the state legislatures, or by ad hoc state conventions. Neither the President nor the federal judiciary is allocated any obvious constitutional role in the amendment process. To those who might suggest the Constitutional Convention did not intend to grant such wide authority to Congress, ERA supporters can counter by noting that the founders provided a second mode of amendment, through a convention summoned by Congress at the request of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. The suggestion here is that the founders deliberately provided Congress with plenary authority over the amendment process, while simultaneously checking it through the super-majority requirement, and balancing it with the Article V Convention alternative. In the case of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, it has been inferred by ERA supporters that since neither ratification deadlines nor contemporaneity requirements for amendments appear anywhere in Article V, Congress is free to propose, alter, or terminate such ratification provisions at its discretion. Advocates of congressional authority over the amendment process might also note the fact that Congress has acted on several occasions in the course of, or after, the ratification process by the states to assert its preeminent authority under Article V in determining ratification procedures. For instance, on July 21, 1868, Congress passed a resolution that declared the Fourteenth Amendment to have been duly ratified and directed Secretary of State William Seward to promulgate it as such. Congress had previously received a message from the Secretary reporting that 28 of 37 states then in the Union had ratified the amendment, but that 2 of the 28 ratifying states had subsequently passed resolutions purporting to rescind their ratifications, and the legislatures of 3 others had approved the amendment only after previously rejecting earlier ratification resolutions. Congress considered these issues but proceeded to declare the ratification process complete. Congress similarly exercised its authority over the process less than two years later when it confirmed the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by resolution passed on March 30, 1870. Congress exercised its authority over the amendment process again in 1992 when it declared the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, the so-called \"Madison Amendment,\" to have been ratified, an event examined in the next section of this report. Opponents of ERA extension, while not questioning the plenary authority of Congress over the amending process, raise questions on general grounds of constitutional restraint and fair play. Some reject it on fundamental principle; Grover Rees III, writing in T he T exas Law Review , asserted that ... extension is unconstitutional insofar as it rests on the unsubstantiated assumption that states which ratified the ERA with a seven-year time limit also would have ratified with a longer time limit, and insofar as it attempts to force those states into an artificial consensus regardless of their actual intentions. ERA supporter Mary Frances Berry noted a similar argument raised by the amendment's opponents: ... some scholars pointed out that legally an offer and agreed-upon terms is required before any contract is valid. ERA ratification, according to this view, was a contract. Therefore, states could not be regarded as contracting not in the agreed upon terms. The agreed upon terms included a seven-year time limit. When seven years passed, all pre-existing ratifications expired. Writing in Constitutional Commentary , authors Brannon P. Denning and John R. Vile offered additional criticisms of efforts to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, noting that ample time had been provided for ratification between 1972 and 1982. They further suggested that elimination of ratification deadlines would reopen the question of purported state rescissions of acts of ratification; that progress in women's equality in law and society may have \"seemed to render ERA superfluous\"; and that allowing the proposed amendment \"a third bite at the apple would suggest that no amendment to the U.S. Constitution ever proposed ... could ever be regarded as rejected.\" The Madison Amendment (the Twenty-Seventh Amendment): A Dormant Proposal Revived and Ratified Supporters of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment cite another source in support of their argument for the proposed amendment's viability: the Twenty-Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, also known as the Madison Amendment, which originated during the first year of government under the Constitution, but fell into obscurity, and became the object of renewed public interest only in the late 20 th century. In 1789, Congress proposed a group of 12 amendments to the states for ratification. Articles III through XII of the proposals became the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. They were ratified quickly, and were declared adopted on December 15, 1791. Articles I and II, however, were not ratified along with the Bill of Rights; Article II, which required that no change in Members' pay could take effect until after an election for the House of Representatives had taken place, was ratified by six states between 1789 and 1791 (the ratification threshold was 10 states in 1789), after which it was largely forgotten. After nearly two centuries, the Madison Amendment was rediscovered in 1978, when the Wyoming legislature was informed that as no deadline for ratification had been established, the measure was arguably still viable. Seizing on the opportunity to signal its disapproval of a March 3, 1978, vote by Congress to increase compensation for Representatives and Senators, the legislature passed a resolution approving the proposed amendment. In its resolution of ratification, the legislature cited the congressional vote to increase Member compensation, noting that: ... the percentage increase in direct compensation and benefits [to Members of Congress] was at such a high level, as to set a bad example to the general population at a time when there is a prospect of a renewal of double-digit inflation; and ... increases in compensation and benefits to most citizens of the United States are far behind these increases to their elected Representatives.... \" The Wyoming legislature's action went almost unreported, however, until 1983, when Gregory D. Watson, a University of Texas undergraduate student, studied the amendment and concluded that it was still viable and eligible for ratification. Watson began a one-person campaign, circulating letters that drew attention to the proposal to state legislatures across the country. This grassroots effort developed into a nationwide movement, leading ultimately to 31 additional state ratifications of the amendment between 1983 and 1992. In 1991, as the number of state ratifications of the Madison Amendment neared the requisite threshold of 38, Representative John Boehner of Ohio introduced H.Con.Res. 194 in the 102 nd Congress. The resolution noted that, \"this amendment to the Constitution was proposed without a deadline for ratification and is therefore still pending before the States.\" The resolution went on to state \"the sense of the Congress that at least 3 of the remaining 15 States should ratify the proposed 2 nd amendment to the Constitution, which would delay the effect of any law which varies the compensation of Members of Congress until after the next election of Representatives.\" Although no further action was taken on the resolution, its findings anticipated Congress's response to the amendment. On May 7, 1992, the Michigan and New Jersey legislatures both voted to ratify the \"Madison Amendment,\" becoming the 38 th and 39 th states to approve it. As required by law, the Archivist of the United States certified the ratification on May 18, and the following day an announcement that the amendment had become part of the Constitution was published in the Federal Register . Although the Archivist was specifically authorized by the U.S. Code to publish the act of adoption and issue a certificate declaring the amendment to be adopted, many in Congress believed that, in light of the unusual circumstances surrounding the ratification, positive action by both houses was necessary to confirm the Madison Amendment's legitimacy. In response, the House adopted H.Con.Res. 320 on May 20, and the Senate adopted S.Con.Res. 120 and S.Res. 298 on the same day. All three resolutions declared the amendment to be duly ratified and part of the Constitution. By providing a recent example of a proposed amendment that had been inactive for more than a century, the Twenty-Seventh Amendment suggests to ERA supporters an attainable model for renewed consideration of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Ratification of the Madison Amendment: A Model for the Proposed Equal Rights Amendment? The example of the Madison Amendment contributed to the emergence of a body of advocacy scholarship that asserts the proposed Equal Rights Amendment has never lost its constitutional viability. One of the earliest expressions of this viewpoint was offered in an article that appeared in the William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law in 1997. The authors reasoned that adoption of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment challenged many of the assumptions about ratification generated during the 20 th century. Acceptance of the Madison Amendment by the Archivist and the Administrator of General Services, as advised by the Justice Department and ultimately validated by Congress, was said to confirm that there is no requirement that ratifications of proposed amendments must be roughly contemporaneous. The authors went on to examine the history of the seven-year time limit, concluding after a review of legal scholarship on the subject that this device was a matter of procedure, rather than of substance (i.e., part of the body of the amendment itself). As such it was \"separate from the amendment itself, and therefore, it can be treated as flexible.\" By extending the original ERA deadline, Congress based its action on the broad authority over the amendment process conferred on it by Article V. Finally, the authors asserted, relying on the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, that \"even if the seven-year limit was a reasonable legislative procedure, a ratification after the time limit expired can still be reviewed and accepted by the current Congress.... \" In their view, even if one Congress failed to extend or remove the ratification deadline, states could still ratify, and a later Congress could ultimately validate their ratifications.  Other observers question the value of the Madison Amendment as precedent. Writing in Constitutional Commentary , Denning and Vile asserted that the Twenty-Seventh Amendment presented a poor model for ERA supporters. Examining the amendment's origins, they suggested that \"the courts and most members of Congress have tended to treat the 27 th as a 'demi-amendment,' lacking the full authority of the 26 that preceded it.\" Reviewing what they characterized as unfavorable interpretations of the Madison Amendment in various legal cases, the authors asked whether what they referred to as the \"jury rigged ratification of the ERA might result in its similar evisceration by the judiciary that will be called upon to interpret it.\" Similarly, a commentary in National Law Journal asserted that, by blocking its own cost of living salary increases, Congress itself has also persistently failed to observe the Madison Amendment's requirements that \"[n]o law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.\" On the other hand, supporters of the proposed ERA might claim that such criticism of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment refers more to what they might characterize as the flawed application of the amendment, rather than the intrinsic integrity of the amendment itself. Constitutional scholar Michael Stokes Paulsen further questioned use of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment as an example in the case of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. He returned to the contemporaneity issue, suggesting that the amending process ... should be occasions , not long, drawn-out processes. To permit ratification over a period of two centuries is to erode, if not erase the ideal of overwhelming popular agreement.... There is no assurance that the Twenty-seventh Amendment ever commanded, at any one time , popular assent corresponding to the support of two-thirds of the members of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the state legislatures. (Emphases in the original.) It could be further argued by opponents of proposed Equal Rights Amendment extension that, whatever the precedent set by Congress in declaring the Twenty-Seventh Amendment to have been regularly adopted, there is no precedent for Congress promulgating an amendment based on state ratifications adopted after two ratification deadlines have expired. The Role of the Supreme Court Decisions in Dillon v. Gloss and Coleman v. Miller By some measures, the action of the Archivist of the United States in announcing ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, followed by congressional confirmation of its viability, superseded a body of constitutional principle that had prevailed since the 1920s and 1930s. This body of theory and political consideration arguably originated with the Supreme Court's 1921 decision in Dillon v. Gloss , the case in which the Court first enunciated the principle that conditions of ratification for proposed constitutional amendments could be determined by Congress, and that the conditions should be roughly contemporaneous. The Court concluded that, relying on the broad grant of authority contained in Article V, Congress had the power, \"keeping within reasonable limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification.... \"  At the same time, the Court noted that nothing in the nation's founding documents touched on the question of time limits for ratification of a duly proposed constitutional amendment, and asked whether ratification would be valid at any time ... within a few years, a century or even a longer period, or that it must be had within some reasonable period which Congress is left free to define? Neither the debates in the federal convention which framed the Constitution nor those in the state conventions which ratified it shed any light on the questions. Ultimately, however, the Court concluded that proposal of an amendment by Congress and ratification in the states are both steps in a single process, and that amendments ... are to be considered and disposed of presently.... [A] ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people and is to be effective when had in three-fourths of the states, there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently contemporaneous in that number of states to reflect the will of the people in all sections at relatively the same period, which of course ratification scattered through a long series of years would not do. The need for contemporaneity was also discussed by the Court with regard to the congressional apportionment amendment and the Madison Amendment, both of which were pending in 1921. The Court maintained that the ratification of these amendments so long after they were first proposed would be \"untenable.\" Some scholars dispute the Court's position in Dillon , however; Mason Kalfus, writing in The University of Chicago Law Review , claimed that reference to the contemporaneity doctrine is to be found neither in the text of Article V nor in the deliberations of the Philadelphia Convention. In Coleman v. Miller , the Supreme Court explicitly held that Congress had the sole power to determine whether an amendment is sufficiently contemporaneous, and thus valid, or whether, \"the amendment ha[s] lost its vitality through the lapse of time.\" In Coleman , the High Court refined its holdings in Dillon , ruling that when it proposes a constitutional amendment: Congress may fix a reasonable time for ratification; there was no provision in Article V that suggested a proposed amendment would be open for ratification forever; since constitutional amendments were deemed to be prompted by some type of necessity, they should be dealt with \"presently\"; it could be reasonably implied that ratification by the states under Article V should be sufficiently contemporaneous so as to reflect a nationwide consensus of public approval in relatively the same period of time; and ratification of a proposed amendment must occur within some reasonable time after proposal. The Court additionally ruled, however, that if Congress were not to specify a reasonable time period for ratification of a proposed amendment, it would not be the responsibility of the Court to decide what constitutes such a period. The Court viewed such questions as essentially political and, hence, nonjusticiable, believing that the questions were committed to, and must be decided by, Congress in exercise of its constitutional authority to propose an amendment or to specify the ratification procedures for an amendment.  This \"political question\" interpretation of the contemporaneity issue is arguably an additional element supporting the fundamental constitutional doctrine of continued viability claimed by ERA advocates. Another observer suggests, however, that the constitutional foundation of the Supreme Court's ruling in Coleman v. Miller , and hence the political question doctrine, may have been affected by the contemporary political situation. According to this theory, the Court in 1939 may have been influenced by, and overreacted to, the negative opinion generated by its political struggles with President Franklin Roosevelt over the constitutionality of New Deal legislation: \"A later court, bruised by its politically unpopular New Deal rulings, retreated somewhat from a dogmatic defense of ratification time limits (as enunciated in Dillon v. Gloss ).\" Michael Stokes Paulsen also questioned the Supreme Court's decision in Coleman v. Miller , suggesting that the \"political question\" doctrine could be interpreted to assert a degree of unchecked congressional authority over the ratification process that is arguably anti-constitutional. Ancillary Issues A range of subsidiary issues could also come under Congress's purview should it consider revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment or a signal to the states that it would consider additional ratifications beyond the expired ratification deadline in the congressional resolutions. Origins of the Seven-Year Ratification Deadline One historical issue related to consideration of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment concerns the background of the seven-year deadline for ratification that originated with the Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition). The amendment was proposed in 1917, proceeded rapidly through the state ratification process, and was declared to be adopted in 1919. During Senate consideration of the proposal, Senator and, later, President Warren Harding of Ohio is claimed to have originated the idea of a ratification deadline for the amendment as a political expedient, one that would \"permit him and others to vote for the amendment, thus avoiding the wrath of the 'Drys' (prohibition advocates), yet ensure that it would fail of ratification.\" As it happened, the law of unintended consequences intervened, as \"[s]tate ratification proceeded at a pace that surprised even the Anti-Saloon League, not to mention the calculating Warren Harding.\" Proposed on December 18, 1917, the amendment was declared to have been adopted just 13 months later, on January 29, 1919. ERA supporters might cite this explanation of the origins of the seven-year ratification deadline in addition to their central assertions of the amendment's viability. They could claim that, far from being an immutable historical element in the amendment process, bearing with it the wisdom of the founders, the ratification time limit is actually the product of a failed political maneuver, and is, moreover, of comparatively recent origin. Opponents of extension might argue, however, that, whatever its origins, the seven-year ratification deadline has become a standard element of nearly all subsequent proposed amendments. They might further note that if ratification deadlines were purely political, Congress would not have continued to incorporate them in nine subsequent proposed amendments. In their judgment, these time limits not only ensure that proposed constitutional amendments enjoy both broad and contemporaneous support in the states, but they also arguably constitute an important element in the checks and balances attendant to the amendment process. Rescission In addition to this question, the constitutional issue of rescission would almost certainly recur in a contemporary revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. As noted earlier in this report, five states enacted resolutions purporting to rescind their previously adopted ratifications of the proposed amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho ruled in 1981 that states had the option to rescind their instruments of ratification any time in the process prior to the promulgation or certification of the proposed amendment, a decision that was controversial at the time. The Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from the decision, but after the extended ERA ratification deadline expired on June 30, 1982, the High Court in its autumn term vacated the lower court decision and remanded the decision to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the case.  It may be noted by ERA supporters, however, that since the Supreme Court ruled in Coleman v. Miller that Congress has plenary power in providing for the ratification process, it may be inferred from this holding that Congress also possesses dispositive authority over the question as to the validity of rescission. Moreover, they might also note that its1868 action directing Secretary of State William Seward to declare the Fourteenth Amendment to be ratified, notwithstanding two state rescissions, further confirms Congress's broad authority over the amendment process. Speculation on potential future court action on this question is beyond the scope of this report, but rescission arguably remains a potentially viable constitutional issue that could arise in response to a revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Congressional Promulgation of Amendments Some observers have noted that, while Congress passed resolutions declaring the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-Seventh Amendments to be valid, congressional promulgation of amendments that have been duly ratified is not necessary, and has no specific constitutional foundation. In his 1992 Memorandum for the Counsel to the President concerning the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, Acting Assistant Attorney General Timothy Flanigan, wrote that Article V clearly delimits Congress's role in the amendment process. It authorizes Congress to propose amendments and specify their mode of ratification, and requires Congress, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the States, to call a convention for the proposing of amendments. Nothing in Article V suggests that Congress has any further role. Indeed, the language of Article V strongly suggests the opposite: it provides that, once proposed, amendments \"shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by\" three-fourths of the States. (Emphasis original in the memorandum, but not in Article V.) The same viewpoint has been advanced by constitutional scholar Walter Dellinger. Addressing the question shortly after the Twenty-Seventh Amendment was declared to have been ratified, he noted An amendment is valid when ratified. There is no further step. The text requires no additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification by the final state. The creation of a \"third step\"\u2014promulgation by Congress\u2014has no foundation in the text of the Constitution. Supporters of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, however, might refer again to the Supreme Court's ruling in Coleman v. Miller . If plenary authority over the amendment process rests with Congress, advocates might ask, does it also presumably extend to other issues that arise, including provision for such routine procedures as promulgation of an amendment? The Proposed District of Columbia Voting Rights (Congressional Representation) Amendment\u2014Congress Places a Ratification Deadline in the Body of the Amendment Congress has proposed one constitutional amendment to the states since the proposed Equal Rights Amendment began the ratification process in 1972, the District of Columbia Voting Rights (Congressional Representation) Amendment. For this amendment, Congress returned to the earlier practice of placing a deadline for ratification directly in the body of the proposal itself. According to contemporary accounts, this decision was influenced by the nearly concurrent congressional debate over the ERA deadline extension. The District of Columbia is a unique jurisdiction, part of the Union, but not a state, and subject to \"exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever ... by Congress.\" Congress has exercised its authority over the nation's capital with varying degrees of attention and control, and through a succession of different governing bodies, beginning in 1800. By the 1950s, the long-disenfranchised citizens of Washington, DC, began to acquire certain rights. The Twenty-Third Amendment, ratified in 1961, established their right to vote in presidential elections. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson used his reorganization authority to establish an appointed mayor and a city council, also presidentially appointed. In 1970, Congress provided by law for a non-voting District of Columbia Delegate to Congress, who was seated in the House of Representatives. In 1973, President Richard Nixon signed legislation that established an elected mayor and council, while reserving ultimate authority over legislation to Congress. After more than a decade of change, proponents asserted that voting representation in Congress proportionate to that of a state would be an important step in the progress toward full self-government by the District of Columbia. In 1977, Representative Don Edwards of California, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, introduced H.J.Res. 554 (95 th Congress). The resolution, as introduced, comprised the following text: Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states within seven years of the date of its submission by the Congress: Article\u2014 Section 1. For purpose of representation in the Congress, election of the President, and Article V of this Constitution, the District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall be treated as though it were a state. Section 2. The exercise of the rights and powers conferred under this article shall be by the people of the District constituting the seat of government, and as shall be provided by the Congress. Section 3. The twenty-third article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. Extensive hearings were held in the subcommittee in 1977, and on February 15, 1978, the full Judiciary Committee reported the measure to the House. The committee, however, adopted an amendment offered by Representative M. Caldwell Butler of Virginia that incorporated the seven-year ratification deadline directly in the body of the resolution, rather than in the preamble. Congressional Quarterly reported that this provision ... was intended to ensure that the deadline could not be extended by a simple majority vote of Congress. The Justice Department has said in the case of the Equal Rights Amendment that Congress could extend the deadline for ratification by a simple majority vote because the time limit was contained in the resolving clause rather than in the body of that amendment. Similarly, writing in Fordham Urban Law Journal during the same period, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah noted that: Section 4 of the D.C. Amendment requires that ratification of the necessary three-fourths of the states must occur within seven years of the date of its submission to the states. The inclusion of this provision within the body of the resolution will avoid a similar controversy to that which has arisen with respect to the time limit for ratification of the proposed \"Equal Rights Amendment.\" During consideration of H.J.Res. 554 in the full House, language setting the ratification deadline was deleted from the authorizing resolution, and the Butler amendment was incorporated in the body of the proposal by voice vote as a new section: Section 4. This article shall be inoperative, unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States within seven years from the date of its submission. The amendment passed the House on March 2, 1978, by a margin of 289 to 127, 11 votes more than the two-thirds constitutional requirement. The Senate took up the House-passed resolution on August 16, 1978. During four days of debate, it rejected a wide range of amendments, voting to adopt H.J.Res. 554 on August 22 by a margin of 67 to 32, one vote more than the constitutional requirement. The District of Columbia Congressional Representation Amendment expired on August 2, 1985, seven years after it was proposed by Congress. It was ultimately ratified by 16 states, 22 short of the constitutionally mandated requirement that it be approved by three-fourths, or 38, of the states. Concluding Observations The arguments and constitutional principles relied on by ERA supporters to justify the revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment include, but may not be limited to, the following:  Article V, they assert, grants exceptionally broad discretion and authority over the constitutional amendment process to Congress. In their interpretation, the example of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment suggests that there is no requirement of contemporaneity in the ratification process for proposed constitutional changes. ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court's decision in Coleman v. Miller gives Congress wide discretion in setting conditions for the ratification process. Far from being sacrosanct and an element in the founders' \"original intent,\" the seven-year deadline for amendments has its origins in a political maneuver by opponents of the Eighteenth Amendment authorizing Prohibition. The decision of one Congress in setting a deadline for ratification of an amendment does not constrain a later Congress from rescinding the deadline and reviving or acceding to the ratification of a proposed amendment. Against these statements of support may be weighed the cautions of other observers who may argue as follows: The Twenty-Seventh Amendment is a questionable model for efforts to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment; unlike the proposed amendment, it was not encumbered by two expired ratification deadlines. Moreover, it is argued that Congress has generally ignored its provisions since ratification. Even though the proposed Equal Rights Amendment received an extension, supporters were unable to gain approval by three-fourths of the states. Opponents suggest that a \"third bite of the apple\" is arguably unfair and, if not unconstitutional, at least contrary to the founders' intentions. Revivification opponents caution ERA supporters against an overly broad interpretation of Coleman v. Miller , which, they argue, may have been be a politically influenced decision . Congress implicitly recognized its misjudgment on the ratification deadline for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment when it incorporated such a requirement in the text of the proposed District of Columbia Voting Rights (Congressional Representation) Amendment. The rescission issue was not conclusively decided in the 1980s and remains potentially open to congressional or judicial action if the proposed Equal Rights Amendment is reopened for further ratifications. Congress could revisit the contending points raised by different analysts if it gives active consideration to legislation that would seek specifically to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, or to accept the additional state ratifications. In recent years, some supporters of the proposed ERA have embraced the three-state strategy, which maintains that Congress has the authority to effectively repeal the ratification deadlines provided in H.J. Res. 208, 92 nd Congress and H.J.Res. 638 , 95 th Congress. In the 115 th Congress, S.J.Res. 5 and H.J.Res. 53 incorporate this approach, which could be more accurately described as a \"one-state strategy\" following ratification by Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. Alternatively, Congress could propose a \"fresh start\" equal rights amendment; such proposals have been introduced regularly since the original ERA time limit expired in 1982. This approach might avoid the controversies that have been associated with repeal of the deadlines for the 1972 ERA, but starting over would present a fresh constitutional amendment with the stringent requirements provided in Article V: approval by two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of the states. It would, however, be possible to draft the proposal without a time limit, as is the case with S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res. 33 in the 115 th Congress. If approved by Congress in this form, the proposed amendment would, as was the case with the Madison Amendment, remain current, viable, and thus eligible for ratification, for an indefinite period.\n",

      "Introduction On July 20, 1923, the National Woman's Party (NWP) met in Seneca Falls, New York, to commemorate the 75 th anniversary of the historic Seneca Falls Convention and celebrate the 1920 ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, by which women won the right to vote. At the meeting, NWP leader Alice Paul announced her next project would be to develop and promote a new constitutional amendment, guaranteeing equal rights and equality under the law in the United States to women and men. Paul, a prominent suffragist, noted the recent ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, which established the right of women to vote.",
      " She characterized an \"equal rights\" amendment as the next logical step for the women's movement. The proposed amendment was first introduced six months later, in December 1923, in the 68 th Congress. Originally named \"the Lucretia Mott Amendment,\" in honor of the prominent 19 th century abolitionist, women's rights activist, and social reformer, the draft amendment stated that, \"men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\"  Nearly half a century passed before the Mott Amendment, as amended and ultimately renamed the Alice Paul Amendment, was approved by Congress and proposed to the states for ratification in 1972.",
      " In common with the Eighteenth and Twentieth through Twenty-Sixth Amendments, the proposed ERA included a seven-year deadline for ratification; in this case the deadline was included in the proposing clause, or preamble, that preceded the text of the amendment. After considerable early progress in the states, ratifications slowed, and the process ultimately stalled at 35 states in 1977, 3 short of the 38 approvals (three-fourths of the states) required by the Constitution. As the 1979 deadline approached, however, ERA supporters capitalized on the fact that the seven-year time limit was incorporated in the amendment's proposing clause,",
      " rather than in the body of the amendment. Concluding that the amendment itself was, therefore, not time-limited, Congress extended the ratification period by 38 months, through 1982. No further states added their approval during the extension, however, and the proposed ERA appeared to expire in 1982. Since the proposed ERA's extended ratification period expired in 1982, Senators and Representatives have continued to introduce new versions of the amendment, beginning in the 97 th Congress. More recently, new analyses emerged that led ERA supporters to assert that the amendment remains viable, and that the period for its ratification could be extended indefinitely by congressional action.",
      " Resolutions embracing this thesis have been introduced beginning in the 112 th Congress. Their stated purpose is that of \"[r]emoving the deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.\" If enacted, these measures would eliminate the 1979 and 1982 deadlines; reopen the proposed ERA for state ratification at the present count of 37 states; and extend the period for state ratification indefinitely. This report examines the legislative history of the various proposals that ultimately emerged as the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. It identifies and provides an analysis of current legislative proposals and reviews contemporary factors that may bear on its present and future viability. Most Recent Developments 115th Congress Proposals As the 115 th Congress convened,",
      " resolutions were introduced in both the House and Senate that embraced two approaches to the Equal Rights Amendment. These include \"fresh start\" proposals that proposed a new constitutional amendment, separate from the amendment proposed by Congress in 1972 (H.J. Res. 208, 92 nd Congress), and proposals designed to reopen the ratification process by removing the deadline included in the resolution proposing the original ERA.  Fresh Start Proposals Perhaps the most basic means of restarting an equal rights amendment would be by introduction of a new joint resolution, a \"fresh start.\" In 1982, even as the extended ratification deadline for the proposed ERA approached,",
      " resolutions proposing a new equal rights amendment were introduced in the 97 th Congress. New versions of the ERA have continued to be introduced in the House and Senate in each succeeding Congress. All have shared language identical or similar to the original proposed by Congress in 1982. Two fresh start amendments have been introduced to date in the 115 th Congress, as detailed below. S.J.Res. 6 The first fresh start ERA proposal to be offered in the 115 th Congress was S.J.Res. 6, introduced by Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey on January 20, 2017. To date, Senator Menendez has been joined by 15 cosponsors.",
      " Senator Menendez's proposal incorporates the language of the original ERA, as proposed in the 92 nd Congress: Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Section 2. \u00a0 The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Section 3. This article shall take effect 2 years after the date of ratification. S.J.Res. 6 has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. H.J.Res. 33 H.J.Res. 33 was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York on January 24,",
      " 2017. To date, Representative Maloney has been joined by 169 cosponsors. This measure is also a fresh start resolution, proposing a new ERA: Section 1. Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Section 2. Congress and the several States shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification. This version of the amendment includes Section 1 language that differs from the version of the ERA proposed by Congress in 1972.",
      " The new wording appeared initially in H.J.Res. 56 in the 113 th Congress. Specifically, Section 1 was amended by the addition of the following clause at its beginning: \"Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.\" In a press release issued at the time, Representative Maloney described this as a... new and improved Equal Rights Amendment.... Today's ERA would prohibit gender discrimination and for the first time, would explicitly mandate equal rights for women.... This ERA is different... it's designed for the 21 st Century. This ERA expressly puts women in the Constitution for the first time. It may also be noted that this language recalls the wording of the first version of the E R A,",
      " as drafted by suffragist Alice Paul in 1923 and introduced in the 68 th Congress in 1923: Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.  Further, the resolution expands enforcement authority for the amendment \"by appropriate legislation,\" extending it from Congress to include \"the several States.\" H.J.Res. 33 has been referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary. Discussion  As joint resolutions proposing an amendment to the Constitution, S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res.",
      " 33 would require approval in identical form by two-thirds of the Members present and voting in both chambers of Congress. Unlike a standard joint resolution that has the force of law, the President's approval is not necessary for joint resolutions that propose amendments. Both resolutions prescribe that the proposed amendment would be submitted to the legislatures of the states for ratification. Neither S.J.Res. 6 nor H.J.Res. 33 includes a time limit for ratification, either in their preambles, or in the body of the amendment. While a ratification deadline has been included in either the preamble or the text of the 18 th and 20 th through 26 th Amendments,",
      " it is a tradition dating to the early 20 th century, rather than a constitutional requirement. If Congress were to propose either of these resolutions to the states as a constitutional amendment, they would arguably be eligible for ratification indefinitely. In not setting a ratification deadline, these measures thus avoid the expiration issues associated with the original proposed Equal Rights Amendment. They also arguably embrace the assumption under which the 27 th Amendment was ratified in 1992, some 203 years after Congress sent it to the states for approval: proposed amendments remain constitutionally valid and eligible for ratification unless a deadline is specifically prescribed when the amendment is proposed. Opponents,",
      " however, might argue that the seven-year ratification deadline first included in the 18 th Amendment should not be lightly discarded. The inclusion of a \"sunset\" provision on proposed amendments, they might argue, is necessary to ensure that a contemporaneous majority of the people, and through them the state legislatures, favors the measure. This issue is examined at greater length later in this report.  Removing the ERA Ratification Deadline: The \"Three-State Strategy\" Two resolutions introduced in the 115 th Congress, one each in the House and Senate, are designed to reopen the ratification process for H.J. Res. 208, the Equal Rights Amendment proposed by the 92 nd Congress in 1972,",
      " and extend it indefinitely by removing the deadline set in the preamble to the proposed ERA. Both these measures are based on the \"three-state\" argument that (1) Congress has the constitutional authority to propose, alter, or terminate any limits on the ratification of amendments pending before the states; (2) all existing ratifications remain in effect and viable; and (3) rescissions of ratification passed by some states are invalid. The three-state argument is examined in detail later in this report. S.J.Res. 5 This resolution, designed to reopen the ERA ratification process, was introduced by Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland on January 17,",
      " 2017. To date, Senator Cardin has been joined by 36 cosponsors. The purpose of the resolution, as stated in its title is \"[r]emoving the deadline for ratification of the equal rights amendment.\" The text of the resolution states: [t]hat notwithstanding any time limit contained in House Joint Resolution 208, 92d Congress, as agreed to in the Senate on March 22, 1972, the article of amendment proposed to the States in that joint resolution shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution whenever ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States.",
      " S.J.Res. 5 has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee. H.J.Res. 53 This resolution was introduced by Representative Jackie Speier of California on January 31, 2017. To date, Representative Speier has been joined by 166 co-sponsors. The text of H.J.Res. 53 is identical to that of S.J.Res. 5. H.J.Res. 53 has been referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice of the House Committee on the Judiciary. Discussion Many ERA proponents claim that because the amendment as originally proposed by Congress in 1972 did not include a ratification deadline within the amendment text,",
      " it remains potentially viable and eligible for ratification indefinitely. They maintain that Congress possesses the authority both to remove the original 1979 ratification deadline and its 1982 extension, and to restart the ratification clock at the then-current 36-state level, with or without a future ratification deadline. In support, they assert that Article V of the Constitution gives Congress uniquely broad authority over the amendment process. They further cite the Supreme Court's decisions in Dillon v. Glo ss and Coleman v. Miller in support of their position. They also note the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh \"Madison\" Amendment, which was ratified in 1992,",
      " 203 years after Congress proposed it to the states. These issues are examined more fully later in this report. Recent Activity in the State Legislatures: Nevada and Illinois  Although the ratification deadline for the proposed ERA expired in 1982, its proponents have continued to press for action in the legislatures of states that either failed to ratify it, or had previously rejected the amendment. Recent notable developments in the states include action by Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018 to ratify the amendment. Also in 2018, however, proposals to ratify the ERA failed to reach the floor of state legislatures in both Arizona and Virginia,",
      " although supporters in the North Carolina Legislature assert the amendment may come to a vote in that state's legislature during the current session. Nevada and Illinois Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment The most widely-publicized recent ERA developments in the states occurred in March 2017, and May 2018, when Nevada and Illinois ratified the proposed amendment. Their actions raised the number of state ratifications to 37. On March 22, 2017, the Nevada Legislature completed action on a resolution approving the ERA as proposed by H.J.Res. 208 in the 92 nd Congress. With this action, Nevada became the 36 th state to ratify the ERA,",
      " and the first state to do so since 1977. The ratification measure, introduced on February 17 as Senate Joint Resolution 2, (SJR2), passed the Nevada Senate on March 1 and the Nevada House of Representatives on March 20. The Senate's concurrence with a House amendment on March 22 completed the ratification process. The choice of dates had historical significance: H.J.Res. 208 was proposed by Congress on March 22, 1972, exactly 45 years earlier. Press accounts of the action noted that the ratification marked a reversal of earlier actions in Nevada. Efforts to secure ERA ratification in the legislature failed three times in the 1970s and failed once when placed on the ballot as an advisory ballot issue in 1978.",
      " With Nevada's ratification, the three-state strategy arguably changed to a \"two-state strategy,\" and the legislature's action was reported as \"being read by [ERA] supporters as an encouraging sign,\" while the Eagle Forum, an advocacy group historically opposed to ERA, restated its criticism of the amendment, noting the deadline for ratification had been passed in 1982. On May 30, 2018, the Illinois legislature completed action on a resolution approving the ERA as proposed by H.J.Res. 208 in the 92 nd Congress. With this action Illinois became the 37 th state to ratify the amendment. The ratification measure,",
      " introduced as SJRCA (Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 0004) on February 7, 2018, was adopted by the Senate as originally introduced on April 11 and in its final form by the Senate and House of Representatives on May 30. The governor's approval was not required. Contemporary Public Attitudes toward the Equal Rights Amendment Public opinion polls showed support through the 1990s for an equal rights amendment. The first recorded survey on support for the proposal was a CBS News telephone poll conducted in September 1970, in which 56% of respondents approved of an equal rights amendment. Favorable attitudes remained steady in the 1970s and throughout the subsequent ratification period,",
      " during which time levels of support as reported by the Gallup Poll never dropped below 57%. A later ERA-specific survey conducted by CBS News in 1999 reported that 74% of respondents supported the proposed ERA, while 10% were opposed. The ERA's expiration as a pending constitutional amendment was eventually followed by corresponding fall-off in related polling; there is little evidence of related activity by major survey research organizations after 1999, a development that is arguably due to the fact that the ERA was presumed to be a closed issue.  More recently, in 2017, the Harris Survey conducted a poll on women's status in American society.",
      " While it did not include a specific question concerning the ERA, the Harris Survey included the following query: \"There has been much talk recently about changing women's status in society today. On the whole, do you favor or oppose most of the efforts to strengthen and change women's status in society?\" Sixty-six percent of respondents favored strengthening and changing women's status in society, 7% were opposed, and 27% were not sure.  An Equal Rights Amendment: Legislative and Ratification History, 1923-1972 Despite the efforts of women's rights advocates in every Congress, nearly 50 years passed between the time when the Mott Amendment was first introduced in 1923 and the Equal Rights Amendment was approved by Congress and proposed to the states in 1972.",
      " Five Decades of Effort: Building Support for an Equal Rights Amendment in Congress, 1923-1970 The first proposal for an equal rights amendment, drafted by Alice Paul, was introduced in the 68 th Congress in 1923. In its original form, the text of the amendment read as follows: Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Although Alice Paul characterized the then-Lucretia Mott Amendment as a logical and necessary next step in the campaign for women's rights following the Nineteenth Amendment,",
      " the proposal made little progress in Congress over the course of more than two decades. During the years following its first introduction, an equal rights amendment was the subject of hearings in either the House or Senate in almost every Congress. According to one study, the proposal was the subject of committee action, primarily hearings, on 32 occasions between 1923 and 1946, but it came to the floor for the first time\u2014in the Senate\u2014only in the latter year. During this period, however, the proposal continued to evolve. In 1943, for instance, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a version of an equal rights amendment incorporating revised language that remained unchanged until 1971:",
      " Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex. Congress and the several states shall have power, within their respective jurisdictions, to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Throughout this period, amendment proponents faced opposition from traditionalists, organized labor, and some leaders of the women's movement. According to one study of the amendment's long pendency in Congress, \"[t]he most persistent and most compelling trouble that crippled prospects for an ERA from its introduction in 1923 until a year after Congress initially passed it on to the states was opposition from most of organized labor during a period of ascending labor strength.\" A principal objection raised by organized labor and women's organizations that opposed the amendment was concern that the ERA might lead to the loss of protective legislation for women,",
      " particularly with respect to wages, hours, and working conditions. One historian notes that: Through the years of the New Deal and the Truman administration, however, protective legislation for women held a firm place in organized labor's list of policy favorites. Since an ERA threatened protective laws, it and its supporters qualified as the enemy. The nature of opposition from women's groups was illustrated by a 1946 statement issued by 10 prominent figures, including former Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, which asserted that an equal rights amendment would \"make it possible to wipe out the legislation which has been enacted in many states for the special needs of women in industry.\" These attitudes toward the proposal persisted,",
      " even as women in great numbers entered the civilian workforce and the uniformed services during the four years of U.S. involvement in World War II (1941-1945), taking jobs in government, industry, and the service sector that had previously been filled largely by men. Congressional support for an equal rights amendment grew slowly in the late 1940s, but a proposal eventually came to the Senate floor, where it was the subject of debate and a vote in July 1946. Although the 39-35 vote to approve fell short of the two-thirds of Senators present and voting required by the Constitution, it was a symbolic first step.",
      " The so-called Hayden rider, named for its author, Senator Carl Hayden of Arizona, was perhaps emblematic of the arguments ERA advocates faced during the early post-war era. First introduced during the Senate's 1950 debate, this proposal stated that: The provisions of this article shall not be construed to impair any rights, benefits, or exemptions conferred by law upon persons of the female sex. Although the rider's ostensible purpose was to safeguard protective legislation, one source suggested an ulterior motive: \"Hayden deliberately added the riders in order to divide the amendment's supporters, and these tactics delayed serious consideration of the unamended version of the Equal Rights Amendment.\" Whatever the rider's intent,",
      " it was not welcomed by ERA supporters, and was opposed on the floor by Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, at that time the only woman Senator.  The Senate ultimately passed an equal rights amendment resolution that included the Hayden rider twice in the 1950s. In the 81 st Congress, S.J. Res. 25, introduced by Senator Guy Gillette of Iowa and numerous co-sponsors, was approved by a vote of 63-19 on January 25, 1950, a margin that comfortably surpassed the two-thirds of Members present and voting required by the Constitution. An amendment came before the Senate again in the 83 rd Congress,",
      " when Senator John M. Butler of Maryland and co-sponsors introduced S.J. Res. 49. The resolution, as amended by the Hayden rider, passed by a vote of 73-11 on July 16, 1953. Over the next 16 years, the Senate considered various equal rights amendment resolutions in committee in almost every session, but no proposal was considered on the floor during this period. By 1964, however, the Hayden rider had lost support in the Senate as perceptions of the equal rights amendment concept continued to evolve. In the 88 th Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee effectively removed it from future consideration when it stated in its report:",
      "  Your committee has considered carefully the amendment which was added to this proposal on the floor of the Senate.... Its effect was to preserve \"rights, benefits, or exemptions\" conferred by law upon persons of the female sex. This qualification is not acceptable to women who want equal rights under the law. It is under the guise of so-called \"rights\" or \"benefits\" that women have been treated unequally and denied opportunities which are available to men. Between 1948 and 1970, however, the House of Representatives took no action on an equal rights amendment. Throughout this period, Representative Emanuel Celler of New York had blocked consideration of the amendment in the Judiciary Committee,",
      " which he chaired from 1949 to 1953 and again from 1955 to 1973. A Member of the House since 1923, Chairman Celler had been a champion of New Deal social legislation, immigration reform, civil rights legislation, and related measures throughout his career, but his strong connections with organized labor, which, as noted earlier, opposed an equal rights amendment during this period, may have influenced his attitudes toward the proposal. Congress Approves and Proposes the Equal Rights Amendment, 1970-1972 Although proposals for an equal rights constitutional amendment continued to be introduced in every Congress, there was no floor consideration of any proposal by either chamber for almost two decades following the Senate's 1953 action.",
      " By the early 1970s, however, the concept had gained increasing visibility as one of the signature issues of the emerging women's movement in the United States. As one eyewitness participant later recounted: The 1960s brought a revival of the women's rights movement and more insistence on changed social and legal rights and responsibilities. The fact of women's involvement in the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement and their changed role in the economy created a social context in which many women became active supporters of enhanced legislation for themselves. By the time the concept of an equal rights amendment emerged as a national issue, it had also won popular support,",
      " as measured by public opinion polling. As noted earlier in this report, the first recorded survey on support for the proposal was a CBS News telephone poll conducted in September 1970, in which 56% of respondents favored an equal rights amendment. Favorable attitudes remained consistent during the 1970s and throughout the subsequent ratification period. Labor opposition also began to fade, and in April 1970, one of the nation's largest and most influential unions, the United Auto Workers, voted to endorse the concept of an equal rights amendment. In actions that perhaps reflected changing public attitudes, Congress had also moved during the 1960s on several related fronts to address women's equality issues.",
      " The Equal Pay Act of 1963 \"prohibited discrimination on account of sex in payment of wages,\" while the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin [emphasis added]. Although it remained pending, but unacted upon in Congress, proposals for an equal rights amendment had gained support in other areas. The Republican Party had endorsed an earlier version of the amendment in its presidential platform as early as 1940, followed by the Democratic Party in 1944. Both parties continued to include endorsements in their subsequent quadrennial platforms, and, by 1970,",
      " Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon were all on record as having endorsed an equal rights amendment. First Vote in the House, 91st Congress\u20141970 Representative Martha Griffiths of Michigan is widely credited with breaking the legislative stalemate that had blocked congressional action on a series of equal rights amendment proposals for more than two decades. Against the background of incremental change outside Congress, Representative Griffiths moved to end the impasse in House consideration of the amendment. On January 16, 1969, she introduced H.J. Res. 264, proposing an equal rights amendment, in the House of Representatives. The resolution was referred to the Judiciary Committee where,",
      " as had been expected, no further action was taken. On June 11, 1970, however, Representative Griffiths took the unusual step of filing a discharge petition to bring the proposed amendment to the floor. A discharge petition \"allows a measure to come to the floor for consideration, even if the committee of referral does not report it and the leadership does not schedule it.\" In order for a House committee to be discharged from further consideration of a measure, a majority of Representatives (218, if there are no vacancies) must sign the petition. As reported at the time, the use of the discharge petition had seldom been invoked successfully, having gained the necessary support only 24 times since the procedure had been established by the House of Representatives in 1910,",
      " and Representative Griffiths' filing in 1970. By June 20, Representative Griffiths announced that she had obtained the necessary 218 Member signatures for the petition. Although the Judiciary Committee had neither scheduled hearings nor issued a report, the resolution was brought to the House floor on August 10. The House approved the motion to discharge by a vote of 332 to 22, and approved the amendment itself by a vote of 334 to 26.  The Senate had begun to act on a resolution proposing an equal rights amendment in the 91 st Congress in 1970, before the amendment came to the House floor. In May,",
      " the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments held hearings on S.J.Res. 61, the Senate version of an amendment. These hearings were followed by hearings in the full committee in September, and consideration on the Senate floor in early October. Floor debate was dominated by consideration and adoption of two amendments that would have (1) exempted women from compulsory military service, and (2) permitted non-denominational prayer in public schools; and a final amendment that provided alternative language for the resolution. Thus encumbered, the Senate resolution was unacceptable to ERA supporters, but, in any event, the Senate adjourned on October 14 without a vote on the resolution as amended,",
      " and failed to bring it to the floor for final action in the subsequent lame-duck session. Passage and Proposal by Congress, 92nd Congress\u20141971-1972 In the 92 nd Congress, Representative Griffiths began the process anew in the House of Representatives when she introduced H.J.Res. 208, proposing an equal rights amendment. Chairman Celler continued to oppose it, but no longer blocked committee action. After subcommittee and full committee hearings, the House Judiciary Committee reported an amendment on July 14, but the resolution as reported included amendments concerning citizenship, labor standards, and the exemption of women from selective service that were unacceptable to ERA supporters.",
      " When H.J.Res. 208 came to the floor in early October, however, the House stripped out the committee amendments, and, on October 12, it approved the resolution by a bipartisan vote of 354 to 24. The Senate took up the House-passed amendment during the second session of the 92 nd Congress, in March 1972. On March 14, the Judiciary Committee reported a clean version of H.J. Res. 208 after rejecting several amendments, including one adopted by the Subcommittee on the Constitution, and several others offered in the full committee. The resolution was called up on March 15, and immediately set aside.",
      " The Senate began debate on the amendment on March 17, with Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana, a longtime ERA supporter, as floor manager. On the same day, President Richard Nixon released a letter to Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania reaffirming his endorsement of the Equal Rights Amendment. After two days in which the Members debated the proposal, Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina offered a series of amendments that, among other things, would have exempted women from compulsory military service and service in combat units in the U.S. Armed Forces, and preserved existing gender-specific state and federal legislation that extended special exemptions or protections to women. Over the course of two days,",
      " Senator Ervin's amendments were serially considered and rejected, generally by wide margins. On March 22, the Senate approved the House version of the amendment, H.J. Res. 208, by a vote of 84 to 8, with strong bipartisan support. The text of H.J. Res. 208\u2014the Equal Rights Amendment as proposed by the 92 nd Congress\u2014follows: House Joint Resolution 208 Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relative to equal rights for men and women. Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), That  The following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States,",
      " which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years of its submission by the Congress: \"Section 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex. \"Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. \"Section 3. This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.\" The action of the two chambers in approving H.J. Res. 208 by two-thirds majorities of Members present and voting (91.",
      "3% in the Senate and 93.4% in the House) had the effect of formally proposing the amendment to the states for ratification. Congress Sets a Seven-Year Ratification Deadline When it proposed the Equal Rights Amendment, Congress stipulated in the preamble of the joint resolution that the ERA was to be ratified by the constitutionally requisite number of state legislatures (38 then as now) within seven years of the time it was proposed, in order to become a valid part of the Constitution. A time limit for ratification was first instituted with the Eighteenth Amendment, proposed in 1917, and, with the exception of the Nineteenth Amendment and the Child Labor Amendment,",
      " all subsequent proposed amendments have included a ratification deadline of seven years. With respect to the Child Labor Amendment, Congress did not incorporate a ratification deadline when it proposed the amendment in 1924. It was ultimately ratified by 28 states through 1937, 8 short of the 36 required by the Constitution at that time, the Union then comprising 48 states. Although the amendment arguably remains technically viable because it lacked a deadline when proposed, the Supreme Court in 1941 upheld federal authority to regulate child labor as incorporated in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (52 Stat. 1060) in the case of United States v.",
      " Darby Lumber Company (312 U.S. 100 (1941)). In this case, the Court reversed its earlier decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart (24 U.S. 251 (1918)), which ruled that the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916 (39 Stat. 675) was unconstitutional. The amendment is thus widely regarded as having been rendered moot by the Court's 1941 decision. In the case of the Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-First, and Twenty-Second Amendments, the \"sunset\" ratification provision was incorporated in the body of the amendment itself. For subsequent amendments,",
      " however, Congress determined that inclusion of the time limit within its body \"cluttered up\" the proposal. Consequently, all but one of the subsequently proposed amendments \u2014the Twenty-Third, Twenty-Fourth, Twenty-Fifth and Twenty-Sixth, and the ERA\u2014placed the limit in the preamble or authorizing resolution, rather than in the body of the amendment itself. This decision, seemingly uncontroversial at the time, was later to have profound implications for the question of extending the ratification window for the ERA. Ratification Efforts in the States States initially responded quickly once Congress proposed the Equal Rights Amendment for their consideration.",
      " Hawaii was the first state to ratify, on March 22, 1972, the same day the Senate completed action on H.J. Res. 208. By the end of 1972, 22 states had ratified the amendment, and it seemed well on its way to adoption. Opposition to the amendment, however, began to coalesce around organizations like \"STOP ERA,\" which revived many of the arguments addressed during congressional debate. Opponents also broadly asserted that ratification of the amendment would set aside existing state and local laws providing workplace and other protections for women and would lead to other, unanticipated negative social and economic effects.",
      " In 1976, ERA supporters established a counter-organization, \"ERAmerica,\" as an umbrella association to coordinate the efforts of pro-amendment groups and serve as a high-profile national advocate for the amendment. Opposition to the proposed Equal Rights Amendment continued to gain strength, although, as noted earlier in this report, public approval of the amendment never dropped below 54% during the ratification period. Following the first 22 state approvals, 8 additional states ratified in 1973, 3 more in 1974, and 1 each in 1975 and 1977, for an ultimate total of 35, 3 short of the constitutional requirement of 38 state ratifications.",
      " At the same time, however, ERA opponents in the states promoted measures in a number of legislatures to repeal or rescind their previous ratifications. Although the constitutionality of such actions has long been questioned, by 1979, five states had passed rescission measures. The question of rescission will be addressed in detail later in this report. Ratification Is Extended in 1978, but Expires in 1982 By the late 1970s, the ratification process had clearly stalled, and the deadline for ratification as specified in the preamble to H.J. Res. 208 was approaching. Reacting to the impending \"sunset\"",
      " date of March 22, 1979, ERA supporters developed a novel strategy to extend the deadline by congressional resolution. The vehicle chosen by congressional supporters was a House joint resolution, H.J.Res. 638, introduced in the 95 th Congress on October 26, 1977, by Representative Elizabeth Holtzman of New York and others. In its original form, the resolution proposed to extend the deadline an additional seven years, thus doubling the original ratification period.  During hearings in the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, legal scholars debated questions on the authority of Congress to extend the deadline; whether an extension vote should be by a simple majority or a supermajority of two-thirds of the Members present and voting;",
      " and if state rescissions of their ratifications were lawful. The full Judiciary Committee also addressed these issues during its deliberations in 1978. Continuing controversy in the committee and opposition to extending the ratification period a full seven years led to a compromise amendment to the resolution that reduced the proposed extension to three years, three months, and eight days. ERA supporters accepted the shorter period as necessary to assure committee approval of the extension. Two other changes, one that would have recognized the right of states to rescind their ratifications, and a second requiring passage of the extension in the full House by a two-thirds super majority, were both rejected by the committee when it reported the resolution to the House on July 30.",
      " The full House debated the resolution during summer 1978, rejecting an amendment that proposed to recognize states' efforts to rescind their instruments of ratification. Another amendment rejected on the floor would have required votes on the ERA deadline extension to pass by the same two-thirds vote necessary for original actions proposing constitutional amendments. The House adopted the resolution by a vote of 233 to 189 on August 15, 1978. The Senate took up H.J.Res. 638 in October; during its deliberations it rejected amendments similar to those offered in the House and joined the House in adopting the resolution, in this case by a vote of 60 to 36 on October 6.",
      " In an unusual expression of support, President Jimmy Carter signed the joint resolution on October 20, even though the procedure of proposing an amendment to the states is solely a congressional prerogative under the Constitution. During the extended ratification period, ERA supporters sought unsuccessfully to secure the three necessary ratifications for the amendment, while opponents pursued rescission in the states with similarly unsuccessful results. A Gallup Poll reported in August 1981 that 63% of respondents supported the amendment, a higher percentage than in any previous survey, but, as one observer noted, \"The positive poll results were really negative, because additional ratifications needed to come from the states in which support was identified as weakest.\" On June 30,",
      " 1982, the Equal Rights Amendment deadline expired with the number of state ratifications at 35, not counting rescissions. Rescission: A Legal Challenge to the Ratification Process As noted earlier, while ratification of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment was pending, a number of states passed resolutions that sought to rescind their earlier ratifications. By the time the amendment's extended ratification deadline passed in 1982, the legislatures of more than 17 states had considered rescission, and 5 passed these resolutions. Throughout the period, however, legal opinion as to the constitutionality of rescission remained divided. On May 9,",
      " 1979, the state of Idaho, joined by the state of Arizona and individual members of the Washington legislature, brought legal action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, asserting that states did have the right to rescind their instruments of ratification. The plaintiffs further asked that the extension enacted by Congress be declared null and void. On December 23, 1981, District Court Judge Marion Callister ruled (1) that Congress had exceeded its power by extending the deadline from March 22, 1979, to June 30, 1982; and (2) that states had the authority to rescind their instruments of ratification,",
      " provided they took this action before an amendment was declared to be an operative part of the Constitution. The National Organization for Women (NOW), the largest ERA advocacy organization, and the General Services Administration (GSA) appealed this decision directly to the Supreme Court, which, on January 25, 1982, consolidated four appeals and agreed to hear the cases. In its order, the High Court also stayed the judgment of the Idaho District Court. On June 30, as noted earlier, the extended ratification deadline expired, so that when the Supreme Court convened for its term on October 4, it dismissed the appeals as moot, and vacated the district court decision.",
      " Renewed Legislative and Constitutional Proposals, 1982 to the Present Interest in the proposed Equal Rights Amendment did not end when its extended ratification deadline expired on June 30, 1982. Since that time, there have been regular efforts to introduce the concept as a \"fresh start\" in Congress, while additional approaches have emerged that would revive H.J. Res. 208, the amendment as originally proposed by the 92 nd Congress. \"Fresh Start\" Proposals One potential means of restarting an equal rights amendment would be by introduction of a new joint resolution, a \"fresh start.\" Even as the June 30, 1982,",
      " extended ratification deadline approached, resolutions proposing an equal rights amendment were introduced in the 97 th Congress. New versions of an ERA have continued to be introduced in the House and Senate in each succeeding Congress. For many years, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts customarily introduced an equal rights amendment early in the first session of a newly convened Congress; since the 111 th Congress, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey has introduced Senate fresh start proposals. In the House of Representatives, Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York introduced a fresh start equal rights amendment in the 105 th and all succeeding Congresses. Fresh start amendments introduced in the 115 th Congress,",
      " S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res. 33, were discussed earlier in this report, under \"Most Recent Developments.\" \"Three-State\" Proposals In addition to \"fresh start\" proposals, alternative approaches to the ratification question have also emerged over the years. In 1994, Representative Robert E. Andrews of New Jersey introduced H.Res. 432 in the 103 rd Congress. His proposal sought to require the House of Representatives to \"take any legislative action necessary to verify the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment as part of the Constitution when the legislatures of an additional 3 states ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.\" This resolution was a response to the three-state strategy proposed by a pro-",
      "ERA volunteer organization \"ERA Summit\" in the 1990s, which was called following adoption of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, the Madison Amendment, in 1992. The rationale for H.Res. 432, and a succession of identical resolutions offered by Representative Andrews in subsequent Congresses, was that, following the precedent of the Madison Amendment, the ERA remained a valid proposal and the ratification process was still open. Representative Andrews further asserted that the action of Congress in extending the ERA deadline in 1978 provided a precedent by which \"subsequent sessions of Congress may adjust time limits placed in proposing clauses by their predecessors. These adjustments may include extensions of time,",
      " reductions, or elimination of the deadline altogether.\" The influence of the Madison Amendment is examined at greater length later in this report. The year 2012 marked the 30 th anniversary of the expiration of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment's extended ratification deadline. During that period, new analyses emerged that examined the question of whether the amendment proposed in 1972 remains constitutionally viable. As noted later in this report, one of the most influential developments opening new lines of analysis occurred when the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, originally proposed in 1789 as part of a package that included the Bill of Rights, was taken up in the states after more than two centuries and ultimately ratified in 1992.",
      " This action, and Congress's subsequent acknowledgment of the amendment's viability, bear directly on the issue of the current status of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and are examined later in this report. In the 112 th Congress, for the first time since the proposed ERA's deadline expired, resolutions were introduced in both the House and Senate that sought specifically to (1) repeal, or eliminate entirely, the deadlines set in 1972 and 1978; (2) reopen the proposed ERA for state ratification at the then-current count of 35 states; and (3) extend the period for state ratification indefinitely. Current legislation proposing the three state/two state strategy in the 115 th Congress,",
      " S.J.Res. 5 and H.J.Res. 53 were discussed earlier in this report, under \"Most Recent Developments.\" Contemporary Viability of the Equal Rights Amendment Supporters of the ERA, and particularly the three-state strategy\u2014now, arguably, the one-state strategy, assuming the validity of ratifications by Nevada and Illinois\u2014identify a number of sources that they claim support their contention that the proposed Equal Rights Amendment remains constitutionally viable. Other scholars and observers, however, have raised concerns about, or objections to, these assertions. Article V: Congressional Authority over the Amendment Process Proponents of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment cite the exceptionally broad authority over the constitutional amendment process granted to Congress by Article V of the Constitution as a principal argument for their case.",
      " The article's language states that \"[t]he Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution... which... shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States or by Conventions in three fourths thereof....\" While the Constitution is economical with words when spelling out the authority extended to the three branches of the federal government, it does speak specifically when it places limits on these powers. In this instance, the founders placed no time limits or other conditions on congressional authority to propose amendments, so long as they are approved by the requisite two-thirds majority of Senators and Representatives present and voting.",
      " In a 1992 opinion for the Counsel to the President concerning ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, Acting Assistant Attorney General Timothy Flanigan took note of the absence of time limits in Article V, and drew a comparison with their presence in other parts of the Constitution:... [t]he rest of the Constitution strengthens the presumption that when time periods are part of a constitutional rule, they are specified. For example, Representatives are elected every second year... and a census must be taken within every ten year period following the first census, which was required to be taken within three years of the first meeting of Congress..... Neither House of Congress may adjourn for more than three days without the consent of the other... and the President has ten days (Sundays excepted)",
      " within which to sign or veto a bill that has been presented to him.... The Twentieth Amendment refers to certain specific dates, January 3 rd and 20 th. Again, if the Framers had intended there to be a time limit for the ratification process, we would expect that they would have so provided in Article V. Further, Article V empowers Congress to specify either of two modes of ratification: by the state legislatures, or by ad hoc state conventions. Neither the President nor the federal judiciary is allocated any obvious constitutional role in the amendment process. To those who might suggest the Constitutional Convention did not intend to grant such wide authority to Congress,",
      " ERA supporters can counter by noting that the founders provided a second mode of amendment, through a convention summoned by Congress at the request of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. The suggestion here is that the founders deliberately provided Congress with plenary authority over the amendment process, while simultaneously checking it through the super-majority requirement, and balancing it with the Article V Convention alternative. In the case of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, it has been inferred by ERA supporters that since neither ratification deadlines nor contemporaneity requirements for amendments appear anywhere in Article V, Congress is free to propose, alter, or terminate such ratification provisions at its discretion.",
      " Advocates of congressional authority over the amendment process might also note the fact that Congress has acted on several occasions in the course of, or after, the ratification process by the states to assert its preeminent authority under Article V in determining ratification procedures. For instance, on July 21, 1868, Congress passed a resolution that declared the Fourteenth Amendment to have been duly ratified and directed Secretary of State William Seward to promulgate it as such. Congress had previously received a message from the Secretary reporting that 28 of 37 states then in the Union had ratified the amendment, but that 2 of the 28 ratifying states had subsequently passed resolutions purporting to rescind their ratifications,",
      " and the legislatures of 3 others had approved the amendment only after previously rejecting earlier ratification resolutions. Congress considered these issues but proceeded to declare the ratification process complete. Congress similarly exercised its authority over the process less than two years later when it confirmed the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment by resolution passed on March 30, 1870. Congress exercised its authority over the amendment process again in 1992 when it declared the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, the so-called \"Madison Amendment,\" to have been ratified, an event examined in the next section of this report. Opponents of ERA extension, while not questioning the plenary authority of Congress over the amending process,",
      " raise questions on general grounds of constitutional restraint and fair play. Some reject it on fundamental principle; Grover Rees III, writing in T he T exas Law Review, asserted that... extension is unconstitutional insofar as it rests on the unsubstantiated assumption that states which ratified the ERA with a seven-year time limit also would have ratified with a longer time limit, and insofar as it attempts to force those states into an artificial consensus regardless of their actual intentions. ERA supporter Mary Frances Berry noted a similar argument raised by the amendment's opponents:... some scholars pointed out that legally an offer and agreed-upon terms is required before any contract is valid.",
      " ERA ratification, according to this view, was a contract. Therefore, states could not be regarded as contracting not in the agreed upon terms. The agreed upon terms included a seven-year time limit. When seven years passed, all pre-existing ratifications expired. Writing in Constitutional Commentary, authors Brannon P. Denning and John R. Vile offered additional criticisms of efforts to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, noting that ample time had been provided for ratification between 1972 and 1982. They further suggested that elimination of ratification deadlines would reopen the question of purported state rescissions of acts of ratification; that progress in women's equality in law and society may have \"seemed to render ERA superfluous\"; and that allowing the proposed amendment \"a third bite at the apple would suggest that no amendment to the U.S.",
      " Constitution ever proposed... could ever be regarded as rejected.\" The Madison Amendment (the Twenty-Seventh Amendment): A Dormant Proposal Revived and Ratified Supporters of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment cite another source in support of their argument for the proposed amendment's viability: the Twenty-Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, also known as the Madison Amendment, which originated during the first year of government under the Constitution, but fell into obscurity, and became the object of renewed public interest only in the late 20 th century. In 1789, Congress proposed a group of 12 amendments to the states for ratification. Articles III through XII of the proposals became the Bill of Rights,",
      " the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. They were ratified quickly, and were declared adopted on December 15, 1791. Articles I and II, however, were not ratified along with the Bill of Rights; Article II, which required that no change in Members' pay could take effect until after an election for the House of Representatives had taken place, was ratified by six states between 1789 and 1791 (the ratification threshold was 10 states in 1789), after which it was largely forgotten. After nearly two centuries, the Madison Amendment was rediscovered in 1978, when the Wyoming legislature was informed that as no deadline for ratification had been established,",
      " the measure was arguably still viable. Seizing on the opportunity to signal its disapproval of a March 3, 1978, vote by Congress to increase compensation for Representatives and Senators, the legislature passed a resolution approving the proposed amendment. In its resolution of ratification, the legislature cited the congressional vote to increase Member compensation, noting that:... the percentage increase in direct compensation and benefits [to Members of Congress] was at such a high level, as to set a bad example to the general population at a time when there is a prospect of a renewal of double-digit inflation; and... increases in compensation and benefits to most citizens of the United States are far behind these increases to their elected Representatives.... \" The Wyoming legislature's action went almost unreported,",
      " however, until 1983, when Gregory D. Watson, a University of Texas undergraduate student, studied the amendment and concluded that it was still viable and eligible for ratification. Watson began a one-person campaign, circulating letters that drew attention to the proposal to state legislatures across the country. This grassroots effort developed into a nationwide movement, leading ultimately to 31 additional state ratifications of the amendment between 1983 and 1992. In 1991, as the number of state ratifications of the Madison Amendment neared the requisite threshold of 38, Representative John Boehner of Ohio introduced H.Con.Res. 194 in the 102 nd Congress.",
      " The resolution noted that, \"this amendment to the Constitution was proposed without a deadline for ratification and is therefore still pending before the States.\" The resolution went on to state \"the sense of the Congress that at least 3 of the remaining 15 States should ratify the proposed 2 nd amendment to the Constitution, which would delay the effect of any law which varies the compensation of Members of Congress until after the next election of Representatives.\" Although no further action was taken on the resolution, its findings anticipated Congress's response to the amendment. On May 7, 1992, the Michigan and New Jersey legislatures both voted to ratify the \"Madison Amendment,\" becoming the 38 th and 39 th states to approve it.",
      " As required by law, the Archivist of the United States certified the ratification on May 18, and the following day an announcement that the amendment had become part of the Constitution was published in the Federal Register. Although the Archivist was specifically authorized by the U.S. Code to publish the act of adoption and issue a certificate declaring the amendment to be adopted, many in Congress believed that, in light of the unusual circumstances surrounding the ratification, positive action by both houses was necessary to confirm the Madison Amendment's legitimacy. In response, the House adopted H.Con.Res. 320 on May 20, and the Senate adopted S.Con.Res.",
      " 120 and S.Res. 298 on the same day. All three resolutions declared the amendment to be duly ratified and part of the Constitution. By providing a recent example of a proposed amendment that had been inactive for more than a century, the Twenty-Seventh Amendment suggests to ERA supporters an attainable model for renewed consideration of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. Ratification of the Madison Amendment: A Model for the Proposed Equal Rights Amendment? The example of the Madison Amendment contributed to the emergence of a body of advocacy scholarship that asserts the proposed Equal Rights Amendment has never lost its constitutional viability. One of the earliest expressions of this viewpoint was offered in an article that appeared in the William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law in 1997.",
      " The authors reasoned that adoption of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment challenged many of the assumptions about ratification generated during the 20 th century. Acceptance of the Madison Amendment by the Archivist and the Administrator of General Services, as advised by the Justice Department and ultimately validated by Congress, was said to confirm that there is no requirement that ratifications of proposed amendments must be roughly contemporaneous. The authors went on to examine the history of the seven-year time limit, concluding after a review of legal scholarship on the subject that this device was a matter of procedure, rather than of substance (i.e., part of the body of the amendment itself). As such it was \"separate from the amendment itself,",
      " and therefore, it can be treated as flexible.\" By extending the original ERA deadline, Congress based its action on the broad authority over the amendment process conferred on it by Article V. Finally, the authors asserted, relying on the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, that \"even if the seven-year limit was a reasonable legislative procedure, a ratification after the time limit expired can still be reviewed and accepted by the current Congress.... \" In their view, even if one Congress failed to extend or remove the ratification deadline, states could still ratify, and a later Congress could ultimately validate their ratifications.  Other observers question the value of the Madison Amendment as precedent.",
      " Writing in Constitutional Commentary, Denning and Vile asserted that the Twenty-Seventh Amendment presented a poor model for ERA supporters. Examining the amendment's origins, they suggested that \"the courts and most members of Congress have tended to treat the 27 th as a 'demi-amendment,' lacking the full authority of the 26 that preceded it.\" Reviewing what they characterized as unfavorable interpretations of the Madison Amendment in various legal cases, the authors asked whether what they referred to as the \"jury rigged ratification of the ERA might result in its similar evisceration by the judiciary that will be called upon to interpret it.\" Similarly,",
      " a commentary in National Law Journal asserted that, by blocking its own cost of living salary increases, Congress itself has also persistently failed to observe the Madison Amendment's requirements that \"[n]o law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.\" On the other hand, supporters of the proposed ERA might claim that such criticism of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment refers more to what they might characterize as the flawed application of the amendment, rather than the intrinsic integrity of the amendment itself. Constitutional scholar Michael Stokes Paulsen further questioned use of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment as an example in the case of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.",
      " He returned to the contemporaneity issue, suggesting that the amending process... should be occasions, not long, drawn-out processes. To permit ratification over a period of two centuries is to erode, if not erase the ideal of overwhelming popular agreement.... There is no assurance that the Twenty-seventh Amendment ever commanded, at any one time, popular assent corresponding to the support of two-thirds of the members of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the state legislatures. (Emphases in the original.) It could be further argued by opponents of proposed Equal Rights Amendment extension that, whatever the precedent set by Congress in declaring the Twenty-Seventh Amendment to have been regularly adopted,",
      " there is no precedent for Congress promulgating an amendment based on state ratifications adopted after two ratification deadlines have expired. The Role of the Supreme Court Decisions in Dillon v. Gloss and Coleman v. Miller By some measures, the action of the Archivist of the United States in announcing ratification of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, followed by congressional confirmation of its viability, superseded a body of constitutional principle that had prevailed since the 1920s and 1930s. This body of theory and political consideration arguably originated with the Supreme Court's 1921 decision in Dillon v. Gloss, the case in which the Court first enunciated the principle that conditions of ratification for proposed constitutional amendments could be determined by Congress,",
      " and that the conditions should be roughly contemporaneous. The Court concluded that, relying on the broad grant of authority contained in Article V, Congress had the power, \"keeping within reasonable limits, to fix a definite period for the ratification.... \"  At the same time, the Court noted that nothing in the nation's founding documents touched on the question of time limits for ratification of a duly proposed constitutional amendment, and asked whether ratification would be valid at any time... within a few years, a century or even a longer period, or that it must be had within some reasonable period which Congress is left free to define? Neither the debates in the federal convention which framed the Constitution nor those in the state conventions which ratified it shed any light on the questions.",
      " Ultimately, however, the Court concluded that proposal of an amendment by Congress and ratification in the states are both steps in a single process, and that amendments... are to be considered and disposed of presently.... [A] ratification is but the expression of the approbation of the people and is to be effective when had in three-fourths of the states, there is a fair implication that it must be sufficiently contemporaneous in that number of states to reflect the will of the people in all sections at relatively the same period, which of course ratification scattered through a long series of years would not do. The need for contemporaneity was also discussed by the Court with regard to the congressional apportionment amendment and the Madison Amendment,",
      " both of which were pending in 1921. The Court maintained that the ratification of these amendments so long after they were first proposed would be \"untenable.\" Some scholars dispute the Court's position in Dillon, however; Mason Kalfus, writing in The University of Chicago Law Review, claimed that reference to the contemporaneity doctrine is to be found neither in the text of Article V nor in the deliberations of the Philadelphia Convention. In Coleman v. Miller, the Supreme Court explicitly held that Congress had the sole power to determine whether an amendment is sufficiently contemporaneous, and thus valid, or whether, \"the amendment ha[s]",
      " lost its vitality through the lapse of time.\" In Coleman, the High Court refined its holdings in Dillon, ruling that when it proposes a constitutional amendment: Congress may fix a reasonable time for ratification; there was no provision in Article V that suggested a proposed amendment would be open for ratification forever; since constitutional amendments were deemed to be prompted by some type of necessity, they should be dealt with \"presently\"; it could be reasonably implied that ratification by the states under Article V should be sufficiently contemporaneous so as to reflect a nationwide consensus of public approval in relatively the same period of time; and ratification of a proposed amendment must occur within some reasonable time after proposal.",
      " The Court additionally ruled, however, that if Congress were not to specify a reasonable time period for ratification of a proposed amendment, it would not be the responsibility of the Court to decide what constitutes such a period. The Court viewed such questions as essentially political and, hence, nonjusticiable, believing that the questions were committed to, and must be decided by, Congress in exercise of its constitutional authority to propose an amendment or to specify the ratification procedures for an amendment.  This \"political question\" interpretation of the contemporaneity issue is arguably an additional element supporting the fundamental constitutional doctrine of continued viability claimed by ERA advocates. Another observer suggests,",
      " however, that the constitutional foundation of the Supreme Court's ruling in Coleman v. Miller, and hence the political question doctrine, may have been affected by the contemporary political situation. According to this theory, the Court in 1939 may have been influenced by, and overreacted to, the negative opinion generated by its political struggles with President Franklin Roosevelt over the constitutionality of New Deal legislation: \"A later court, bruised by its politically unpopular New Deal rulings, retreated somewhat from a dogmatic defense of ratification time limits (as enunciated in Dillon v. Gloss ).\" Michael Stokes Paulsen also questioned the Supreme Court's decision in Coleman v.",
      " Miller, suggesting that the \"political question\" doctrine could be interpreted to assert a degree of unchecked congressional authority over the ratification process that is arguably anti-constitutional. Ancillary Issues A range of subsidiary issues could also come under Congress's purview should it consider revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment or a signal to the states that it would consider additional ratifications beyond the expired ratification deadline in the congressional resolutions. Origins of the Seven-Year Ratification Deadline One historical issue related to consideration of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment concerns the background of the seven-year deadline for ratification that originated with the Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition). The amendment was proposed in 1917,",
      " proceeded rapidly through the state ratification process, and was declared to be adopted in 1919. During Senate consideration of the proposal, Senator and, later, President Warren Harding of Ohio is claimed to have originated the idea of a ratification deadline for the amendment as a political expedient, one that would \"permit him and others to vote for the amendment, thus avoiding the wrath of the 'Drys' (prohibition advocates), yet ensure that it would fail of ratification.\" As it happened, the law of unintended consequences intervened, as \"[s]tate ratification proceeded at a pace that surprised even the Anti-Saloon League,",
      " not to mention the calculating Warren Harding.\" Proposed on December 18, 1917, the amendment was declared to have been adopted just 13 months later, on January 29, 1919. ERA supporters might cite this explanation of the origins of the seven-year ratification deadline in addition to their central assertions of the amendment's viability. They could claim that, far from being an immutable historical element in the amendment process, bearing with it the wisdom of the founders, the ratification time limit is actually the product of a failed political maneuver, and is, moreover, of comparatively recent origin. Opponents of extension might argue, however,",
      " that, whatever its origins, the seven-year ratification deadline has become a standard element of nearly all subsequent proposed amendments. They might further note that if ratification deadlines were purely political, Congress would not have continued to incorporate them in nine subsequent proposed amendments. In their judgment, these time limits not only ensure that proposed constitutional amendments enjoy both broad and contemporaneous support in the states, but they also arguably constitute an important element in the checks and balances attendant to the amendment process. Rescission In addition to this question, the constitutional issue of rescission would almost certainly recur in a contemporary revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment. As noted earlier in this report,",
      " five states enacted resolutions purporting to rescind their previously adopted ratifications of the proposed amendment. The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho ruled in 1981 that states had the option to rescind their instruments of ratification any time in the process prior to the promulgation or certification of the proposed amendment, a decision that was controversial at the time. The Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from the decision, but after the extended ERA ratification deadline expired on June 30, 1982, the High Court in its autumn term vacated the lower court decision and remanded the decision to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the case.",
      "  It may be noted by ERA supporters, however, that since the Supreme Court ruled in Coleman v. Miller that Congress has plenary power in providing for the ratification process, it may be inferred from this holding that Congress also possesses dispositive authority over the question as to the validity of rescission. Moreover, they might also note that its1868 action directing Secretary of State William Seward to declare the Fourteenth Amendment to be ratified, notwithstanding two state rescissions, further confirms Congress's broad authority over the amendment process. Speculation on potential future court action on this question is beyond the scope of this report, but rescission arguably remains a potentially viable constitutional issue that could arise in response to a revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.",
      " Congressional Promulgation of Amendments Some observers have noted that, while Congress passed resolutions declaring the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Twenty-Seventh Amendments to be valid, congressional promulgation of amendments that have been duly ratified is not necessary, and has no specific constitutional foundation. In his 1992 Memorandum for the Counsel to the President concerning the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, Acting Assistant Attorney General Timothy Flanigan, wrote that Article V clearly delimits Congress's role in the amendment process. It authorizes Congress to propose amendments and specify their mode of ratification, and requires Congress, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the States,",
      " to call a convention for the proposing of amendments. Nothing in Article V suggests that Congress has any further role. Indeed, the language of Article V strongly suggests the opposite: it provides that, once proposed, amendments \"shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by\" three-fourths of the States. (Emphasis original in the memorandum, but not in Article V.) The same viewpoint has been advanced by constitutional scholar Walter Dellinger. Addressing the question shortly after the Twenty-Seventh Amendment was declared to have been ratified, he noted An amendment is valid when ratified. There is no further step.",
      " The text requires no additional action by Congress or anyone else after ratification by the final state. The creation of a \"third step\"\u2014promulgation by Congress\u2014has no foundation in the text of the Constitution. Supporters of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, however, might refer again to the Supreme Court's ruling in Coleman v. Miller. If plenary authority over the amendment process rests with Congress, advocates might ask, does it also presumably extend to other issues that arise, including provision for such routine procedures as promulgation of an amendment? The Proposed District of Columbia Voting Rights (Congressional Representation) Amendment\u2014Congress Places a Ratification Deadline in the Body of the Amendment Congress has proposed one constitutional amendment to the states since the proposed Equal Rights Amendment began the ratification process in 1972,",
      " the District of Columbia Voting Rights (Congressional Representation) Amendment. For this amendment, Congress returned to the earlier practice of placing a deadline for ratification directly in the body of the proposal itself. According to contemporary accounts, this decision was influenced by the nearly concurrent congressional debate over the ERA deadline extension. The District of Columbia is a unique jurisdiction, part of the Union, but not a state, and subject to \"exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever... by Congress.\" Congress has exercised its authority over the nation's capital with varying degrees of attention and control, and through a succession of different governing bodies, beginning in 1800. By the 1950s,",
      " the long-disenfranchised citizens of Washington, DC, began to acquire certain rights. The Twenty-Third Amendment, ratified in 1961, established their right to vote in presidential elections. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson used his reorganization authority to establish an appointed mayor and a city council, also presidentially appointed. In 1970, Congress provided by law for a non-voting District of Columbia Delegate to Congress, who was seated in the House of Representatives. In 1973, President Richard Nixon signed legislation that established an elected mayor and council, while reserving ultimate authority over legislation to Congress. After more than a decade of change,",
      " proponents asserted that voting representation in Congress proportionate to that of a state would be an important step in the progress toward full self-government by the District of Columbia. In 1977, Representative Don Edwards of California, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, introduced H.J.Res. 554 (95 th Congress). The resolution, as introduced, comprised the following text: Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states within seven years of the date of its submission by the Congress:",
      " Article\u2014 Section 1. For purpose of representation in the Congress, election of the President, and Article V of this Constitution, the District constituting the seat of government of the United States shall be treated as though it were a state. Section 2. The exercise of the rights and powers conferred under this article shall be by the people of the District constituting the seat of government, and as shall be provided by the Congress. Section 3. The twenty-third article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed. Extensive hearings were held in the subcommittee in 1977, and on February 15, 1978,",
      " the full Judiciary Committee reported the measure to the House. The committee, however, adopted an amendment offered by Representative M. Caldwell Butler of Virginia that incorporated the seven-year ratification deadline directly in the body of the resolution, rather than in the preamble. Congressional Quarterly reported that this provision... was intended to ensure that the deadline could not be extended by a simple majority vote of Congress. The Justice Department has said in the case of the Equal Rights Amendment that Congress could extend the deadline for ratification by a simple majority vote because the time limit was contained in the resolving clause rather than in the body of that amendment. Similarly, writing in Fordham Urban Law Journal during the same period,",
      " Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah noted that: Section 4 of the D.C. Amendment requires that ratification of the necessary three-fourths of the states must occur within seven years of the date of its submission to the states. The inclusion of this provision within the body of the resolution will avoid a similar controversy to that which has arisen with respect to the time limit for ratification of the proposed \"Equal Rights Amendment.\" During consideration of H.J.Res. 554 in the full House, language setting the ratification deadline was deleted from the authorizing resolution, and the Butler amendment was incorporated in the body of the proposal by voice vote as a new section:",
      " Section 4. This article shall be inoperative, unless it shall have been ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of three-fourths of the States within seven years from the date of its submission. The amendment passed the House on March 2, 1978, by a margin of 289 to 127, 11 votes more than the two-thirds constitutional requirement. The Senate took up the House-passed resolution on August 16, 1978. During four days of debate, it rejected a wide range of amendments, voting to adopt H.J.Res. 554 on August 22 by a margin of 67 to 32,",
      " one vote more than the constitutional requirement. The District of Columbia Congressional Representation Amendment expired on August 2, 1985, seven years after it was proposed by Congress. It was ultimately ratified by 16 states, 22 short of the constitutionally mandated requirement that it be approved by three-fourths, or 38, of the states. Concluding Observations The arguments and constitutional principles relied on by ERA supporters to justify the revival of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment include, but may not be limited to, the following:  Article V, they assert, grants exceptionally broad discretion and authority over the constitutional amendment process to Congress. In their interpretation,",
      " the example of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment suggests that there is no requirement of contemporaneity in the ratification process for proposed constitutional changes. ERA proponents claim that the Supreme Court's decision in Coleman v. Miller gives Congress wide discretion in setting conditions for the ratification process. Far from being sacrosanct and an element in the founders' \"original intent,\" the seven-year deadline for amendments has its origins in a political maneuver by opponents of the Eighteenth Amendment authorizing Prohibition. The decision of one Congress in setting a deadline for ratification of an amendment does not constrain a later Congress from rescinding the deadline and reviving or acceding to the ratification of a proposed amendment.",
      " Against these statements of support may be weighed the cautions of other observers who may argue as follows: The Twenty-Seventh Amendment is a questionable model for efforts to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment; unlike the proposed amendment, it was not encumbered by two expired ratification deadlines. Moreover, it is argued that Congress has generally ignored its provisions since ratification. Even though the proposed Equal Rights Amendment received an extension, supporters were unable to gain approval by three-fourths of the states. Opponents suggest that a \"third bite of the apple\" is arguably unfair and, if not unconstitutional, at least contrary to the founders' intentions. Revivification opponents caution ERA supporters against an overly broad interpretation of Coleman v.",
      " Miller, which, they argue, may have been be a politically influenced decision. Congress implicitly recognized its misjudgment on the ratification deadline for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment when it incorporated such a requirement in the text of the proposed District of Columbia Voting Rights (Congressional Representation) Amendment. The rescission issue was not conclusively decided in the 1980s and remains potentially open to congressional or judicial action if the proposed Equal Rights Amendment is reopened for further ratifications. Congress could revisit the contending points raised by different analysts if it gives active consideration to legislation that would seek specifically to revive the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, or to accept the additional state ratifications.",
      " In recent years, some supporters of the proposed ERA have embraced the three-state strategy, which maintains that Congress has the authority to effectively repeal the ratification deadlines provided in H.J. Res. 208, 92 nd Congress and H.J.Res. 638, 95 th Congress. In the 115 th Congress, S.J.Res. 5 and H.J.Res. 53 incorporate this approach, which could be more accurately described as a \"one-state strategy\" following ratification by Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. Alternatively, Congress could propose a \"fresh start\" equal rights amendment; such proposals have been introduced regularly since the original ERA time limit expired in 1982.",
      " This approach might avoid the controversies that have been associated with repeal of the deadlines for the 1972 ERA, but starting over would present a fresh constitutional amendment with the stringent requirements provided in Article V: approval by two-thirds majorities in both houses of Congress, and ratification by three-fourths of the states. It would, however, be possible to draft the proposal without a time limit, as is the case with S.J.Res. 6 and H.J.Res. 33 in the 115 th Congress. If approved by Congress in this form, the proposed amendment would, as was the case with the Madison Amendment, remain current,",
      " viable, and thus eligible for ratification, for an indefinite period.\n"
    ],
    "answer": "The proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (ERA), which declares that \"equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex,\" was approved by Congress for ratification by the states in 1972. The proposal included a seven-year deadline for ratification. Between 1972 and 1977, 35 state legislatures, of the 38 required by the Constitution, voted to ratify the ERA. Despite a congressional extension of the deadline from 1979 to 1982, no additional states approved the amendment during the extended period, at which time the amendment was widely considered to have expired. Since 1982, Senators and Representatives who support the amendment have continued to introduce new versions of the ERA, generally referred to as \"fresh start\" amendments. In addition, some Members of Congress have also introduced resolutions designed to reopen ratification for the ERA as proposed in 1972, restarting the process where it ended in 1982. This was known as the \"three-state strategy,\" for the number of additional ratifications then needed to complete the process, until Nevada and Illinois ratified the amendment in March 2017 and May 2018, respectively, becoming the 36th and 37th states to do so. The ERA supporters' intention here is to repeal or remove the deadlines set for the proposed ERA, reactivate support for the amendment, and complete the ratification process by gaining approval from the one additional state needed to meet the constitutional requirement, assuming the Nevada and Illinois ratifications are valid. As the 115th Congress convened, resolutions were introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate that embraced both approaches. H.J.Res. 33, introduced by Representative Carolyn Maloney, and S.J.Res. 6, introduced by Senator Robert Menendez, propose \"fresh start\" equal rights amendments. H.J.Res. 53, introduced by Representative Jackie Speier, and S.J.Res. 5, introduced by Senator Benjamin Cardin, would remove the deadline for ratification of the ERA proposed by Congress in 1972. First introduced in Congress in 1923, the ERA proposed to the states in 1972 by the 92nd Congress included the customary seven-year ratification time limit. Although through 1977 the ERA was approved by 35 states, various controversies brought the ratification process to a halt as the deadline approached. In 1978, Congress extended the deadline through 1982. Opponents claimed this violated the spirit, if not the letter of the amendment process; supporters insisted the amendment needed more time for state consideration. Further, they justified extension because the deadline was placed not in the amendment, but in its preamble. Despite the extension, no further states ratified during the extension period, and the amendment was presumed to have expired in 1982. During this period, the ratification question was further complicated when five state legislatures passed resolutions rescinding their earlier ratifications. The Supreme Court agreed to hear cases on the rescission question, but the ERA's ratification time limit expired before they could be argued, and the Court dismissed the cases as moot. Many ERA proponents claim that because the amendment did not include a ratification deadline within the amendment text, it remains potentially viable and eligible for ratification indefinitely. They maintain that Congress possesses the authority both to repeal the original 1979 ratification deadline and its 1982 extension, and to restart the ratification clock at the current 37-state level\u2014including the Nevada and Illinois ratifications\u2014with or without a future ratification deadline. In support, they assert that Article V of the Constitution gives Congress broad authority over the amendment process. They further cite the Supreme Court's decisions in Dillon v. Gloss and Coleman v. Miller in support of their position. They also note the precedent of the Twenty-Seventh \"Madison\" Amendment, which was ratified in 1992, 203 years after Congress proposed it to the states. Opponents of reopening the amendment process may argue that attempting to revive the ERA would be politically divisive, and that providing it with a \"third bite of the apple\" would be contrary to the spirit and perhaps the letter of Article V and Congress's earlier intentions. They might also reject the example of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which, unlike the proposed ERA, never had a ratification time limit. Further, they might claim that efforts to revive the ERA ignore the possibility that state ratifications may have expired with the 1982 deadline, and that amendment proponents fail to consider the issue of state rescission, which has never been specifically decided in any U.S. court. The \"fresh start\" approach provides an alternative means to revive the ERA. It consists of starting over by introducing a new amendment, similar or identical to, but distinct from, the original. A fresh start would avoid potential controversies associated with reopening the ratification process, but would face the stringent constitutional requirements of two-thirds support in both chambers of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states.\n",

    "context": "Update as of September 12, 2013 The Syrian government's apparent acceptance of a Russian proposal for Syria to acknowledge its chemical weapons and place them under international control has recast the ongoing debates over how to respond to an August 21 chemical weapons attack and bring an end to the Syrian civil war. Other parties including Senator Richard Lugar had proposed a U.S.-Russian-facilitated disarmament initiative prior to the announcement. On September 10, Syrian officials signaled their willingness \"to disclose the locations of chemical weapons, to stop producing them, and to reveal these locations to representatives of Russia, other states, and the United Nations\" with the goal of \"ending our possession of all chemical weapons.\" On September 12, in an interview on Russian television, President Asad reportedly said that \"Syria is placing its chemical weapons under international control because of Russia. The U.S. threats did not influence the decision.\" President Asad also stated that his government will be sending documents \"in the next few days\" to the United Nations for joining the international convention that bans the use of chemical munitions. Speaking in a national address on September 10, President Barack Obama said: ... over the last few days, we've seen some encouraging signs, in part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin. The Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons. The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons and even said they'd join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use. It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments, but this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad's strongest allies. I have therefore asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path. I'm sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin. I've spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies -- France and the United Kingdom -- and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons and to ultimately destroy them under international control. President Obama and senior members of his Administration continue to seek authorization from Congress for a limited use of military force against the Asad regime while exploring the potential for the establishment of international control over Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and related elements of its chemical weapons program.  The governments of China, the United Kingdom, and France have responded favorably to the proposal, and, as of September 11, Russia had rejected a French plan for a binding United Nations Security Council resolution that could be enforced with military action. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are scheduled to meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on September 12 to discuss the proposal further. Some Syrian rebel leaders have rejected the proposal and characterized it as a delaying tactic while maintaining their calls for international assistance and punishment of the Syrian government.  Overview and Summary of Recent Developments On August 30, the Obama Administration presented intelligence analysis stating with \"high confidence\" that the Syrian government was responsible for an August 21 chemical weapons attack against civilians in rebel-held areas of the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government continues to categorically deny any responsibility for any chemical weapons attack.  President Obama called the Syrian government's reported use of chemical weapons \"an assault on human dignity\"\u00a0that \"presents a serious danger to our national security.\" He further requested that Congress authorize the use of force for military operations \"against Syrian regime targets\" to \"hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out.\" According to the President, such military operations would be \"limited in duration and scope\" and \"would not put boots on the ground.\"  In the wake of the Russian disarmament proposal, President Obama requested that lawmakers pause in their formal consideration of proposed legislation to authorize the use of force in Syria. Nevertheless, debate continues among Members of Congress about the pros and cons of proposed authorization approaches as well as the disarmament proposal now under discussion. President Obama has stated his view that \"the credible threat of U.S. military action\" contributed to the emergence of the disarmament initiative, and has underscored that he has \"ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.\" A draft resolution authorizing the use of force submitted to Congress by the White House would authorize the President: to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria in order to \u2013 (1) prevent or deter the use or proliferation (including the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors), within, to or from Syria, of any weapons of mass destruction, including chemical or biological weapons or components of or materials used in such weapons; or (2) protect the United States and its allies and partners against the threat posed by such weapons. Lawmakers in the Senate and House are considering alternative authorization proposals, amid concerns that the Administration's proposed text may not sufficiently limit the scope or duration of any potential military response. Others reportedly are drafting proposals that would reflect the disarmament proposal under consideration and could seek to make an authorization for the use of U.S. military force contingent on the satisfaction of criteria related to the enforcement of a disarmament agreement.  On September 4, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee debated and adopted an alternative resolution authorizing the use of military force for specific purposes, including to deter further use of chemical weapons and to prevent the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors within Syria of any weapons of mass destruction. The provision would limit the deployment of U.S. forces on the ground for \"combat operations\" but may not constrain the deployment of U.S. forces in Syria for other purposes. As of September 11, the House had not formally considered an alternative authorization proposal, although some Members had circulated draft proposals or introduced measures that would restrict the availability of funds for U.S. military operations or support for opposition groups in Syria.  In Syria, the brutal civil war continues, even as Syrian government forces were reported to be taking measures to prepare for potential U.S.-led military operations against them. President Bashar al Asad has stated that the United States and others accusing it of carrying out chemical weapons strikes have not presented any evidence to support their allegations, and he has warned that external military intervention in Syria's civil war risks igniting a regional conflict. U.S. military officials have confirmed that the Syrian government has taken steps to prepare for potential attacks, but as of September 10, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey testified that \"The indications are, today, that [Syria's chemical weapons capability] does remain under the firm control of the regime.\" Syrian officials have requested that the United Nations Security Council act to prevent aggression against Syria.  Iran's Supreme Leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, has said that a U.S. attack on Syria would be a \"disaster for the region.\" There have been similar statements from other senior Iranian leaders, but these leaders have not threatened that Iran itself would conduct any retaliation. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commander Major General Mohammed Ali Jafari has stated that, \"The U.S. imagination about limited military intervention in Syria is merely an illusion, as reactions will be coming from beyond Syria's borders.\" Russian and Chinese officials remain opposed to the U.S. proposal for punitive military strikes, while the Arab League has modified its original position insisting on United Nations Security Council action to call for the Security Council and the international community to \"take the deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime for which the Syrian regime bears responsibility.\" The Arab League has welcomed the Russian disarmament proposal, but Arab League Secretary General Nabil al Arabi has emphasized that the group remains focused on punishment for the August 21 incident and international action to bring an end to the civil war.  United Kingdom leaders stated prior to the Russian proposal that they have no intention of seeking new authorization from Parliament to participate in any international military operation following Parliament's rejection of a measure to do so. French government officials have proposed measures to implement the Russian proposal and presented supporting intelligence on September 2 to French legislators concerning what they describe as \"the massive use of chemical agents\" by Syrian government forces. U.S. military assets remain in place in the vicinity of Syria. As of September 2, five guided missile destroyers were reported to be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: the USS Stout , USS Gravely , USS Mahan , USS Barry , and USS Ramage . The USS San Antonio , carrying forces from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and unspecified attack submarines also were reported to be nearby. The USS Kearsarge and the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group were reported to be deploying westward toward the Red Sea. In announcing his decision that punitive military action was required on August 31, President Obama stated, \"I'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that, so far, has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Asad accountable.\" President Obama also said, \"I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization.\" Assessment The war in Syria and the debate over possible punitive U.S. military action against the Asad regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons pose a uniquely challenging series of questions for policy makers. The overarching questions remain how to define, prioritize, and secure the core interests of the United States with regard to Syria's complex civil war. The immediate questions are whether and how best to respond to the apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria and how such a response might affect U.S. interests and standing regionally and globally. In weighing these questions, many Members of Congress and Administration officials are seeking both to protect concrete U.S. national security interests and to preserve abstract international security principles that may serve those interests.  A mass casualty chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21 was the latest and most deadly of a string of reported instances where Syrian forces allegedly have used chemical weapons despite President Obama's prior statement that the transfer or use of chemical weapons is \"a red line\" that would \"change his calculus.\" The President and senior members of his Administration have argued that the United States has a national security interest in ensuring that \"when countries break international norms on chemical weapons they are held accountable.\" Administration officials and some observers believe that by failing to respond after setting out a so-called \"red line,\" the United States would risk not only undermining any international norms against the use of such weapons but would risk undermining its own credibility.  By his own account, President Obama believes that extensive, sustained U.S. military intervention to shape the outcome of Syria's civil conflict is undesirable. Instead, the Obama Administration has worked with Congress to increase U.S. assistance to non-radical elements of the opposition. In response to previous instances of alleged chemical weapons use, the Administration reportedly notified Congress in July 2012 of its intent to begin covert U.S. arming of select groups. On August 31, the President stated his conclusion that the United States should respond to alleged Syrian chemical weapons use with limited militarily strikes.  Administration officials have cited a number of reasons for their skepticism of direct military involvement to shift the balance of power in the underlying conflict, including fears of exacerbating the violence; inviting greater regional spillover or intervention; or opening a power vacuum that could benefit extremists. Other foreign policy priorities also have influenced the Administration's position, such as a desire to maintain limited international consensus on Iran's nuclear program and concern that sectarian and strategic competition in Syria could ignite a regional conflict and threaten U.S. allies and security interests. While condemning Asad as a thug and a murderer and aiding some of his adversaries, U.S. officials have continued to stress the need for a negotiated political solution to the conflict in the hopes of keeping the Syrian state intact, securing its chemical weapon stockpiles and borders, and combating extremist groups now active there.  Some critics have argued that the potential risks that even a limited military response could pose to these objectives outweigh the potential benefits to the United States of reasserting an international standard or being seen to have reliably followed through on a commitment to act. These arguments suggest that if a military strike makes the political solution desired by U.S. officials less likely, then the destabilizing conflict could continue or worsen. Similarly, this line of argument suggests that if military operations were to dramatically degrade remaining state authority\u2014whether intentionally or unintentionally\u2014then undesired outcomes with regard to terrorism, proliferation, or mass atrocities could occur. Still other critics of the Administration, including some Members of Congress, charge that U.S. hesitation to intervene militarily to protect Syrian civilians and/or help oust the Asad government has unnecessarily prolonged the fighting. Over time, these critics argue, the costs of inaction have grown intolerably as the humanitarian situation has deteriorated, violent extremist groups have seized the initiative, and Syria's neighbors, including several U.S. partners, have been overwhelmed by refugees and threatened with violence. Others have argued that by failing to halt the fighting in Syria, the United States and others are exacerbating already volatile Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions throughout Middle East, thus posing risks to other strategically important countries. Finally, some critics argue that U.S. global credibility is being diminished by Asad's reluctance to step down or end abuses of civilians despite U.S. demands. The Russian disarmament proposal and Syria's reported acceptance of its basic terms have introduced even further complication to these debates. At present debate centers on the parameters of the proposal, the feasibility of implementation, the risks and rewards it poses relative to U.S. regional security and nonproliferation goals, and its implications for U.S. international leadership. Syrian opposition leaders' rejection of the proposal and their calls for punitive action and assistance in their struggle against the Asad regime may complicate U.S. relations with opposition groups moving forward. Reconciling immediate U.S. goals with regard to the August 21 incident, medium-term U.S. goals with regard to the conflict and Syria, and overarching goals related to weapons of mass destruction may prove challenging. Sorting through these competing perspectives and prescriptions now falls to Members of Congress as they consider the President's proposed course of action, his request that Congress authorize the use of force, the feasibility of international disarmament proposals for Syria, and the future of U.S. policy with regard to the conflict in Syria and its regional consequences. Summary of U.S. Intelligence on August 21 Incident  An unclassified summary of the U.S. intelligence community's assessment released by the White House concludes, among other things, that:  The United States Government assesses with high confidence that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013. A preliminary U.S. government assessment determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children. The U.S. intelligence community has intelligence that leads it to assess that Syrian chemical weapons personnel\u2014including personnel assessed to be associated with the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), the entity responsible for Syria's chemical weapons program\u2014were preparing chemical munitions prior to the attack. The U.S. intelligence community assesses that the opposition has not used chemical weapons and the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on August 21 is highly unlikely. Satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred\u2014including Kafr Batna, Jawbar, 'Ayn Tarma, Darayya, and Mu'addamiyah (see Figure 1 above). On September 1, Secretary of State John Kerry further stated that tests of blood and hair samples from Syrian first responders obtained by the United States indicated exposure to the nerve agent sarin.  United Nations weapons inspectors have departed Syria, and U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon has requested that the team \"expedite the mission's analysis of the samples and information it had obtained without jeopardizing the scientific timelines required for accurate analysis, and to report the results to him as soon as possible.\" Conflict Update  The August 21 incident occurred as the popular-uprising-turned-armed-rebellion in Syria is in its third year and has devolved into a bloody struggle of attrition between the government and a diverse array of opposition militias. Over the course of Syria's civil war, momentum has shifted between government and rebel forces. Support provided by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters appears to have helped the Asad regime wrest the initiative from the opposition near the city of Homs and to launch counteroffensives on the outskirts of the capital. The August 21 attack appears to have been part of a fierce and ongoing Syrian military bombardment of rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus.  Various opposition forces control areas of northwestern, eastern, and southern Syria (see Figure 2 below). In areas near the northern city of Aleppo, diverse rebel forces have announced limited tactical successes in recent weeks, including the fall of a key military air base. According to close observers of the conflict, some extremist militia groups are seeking to assert political and social control over some areas in which they operate, while they and others among the range of \"extraordinarily fractured\" militia groups continue to battle regime forces for contested areas. Reportedly, the Supreme Military Council (SMC), to which the United States has provided aid, \"is still far from a functioning rebel leadership.\" European press reporting contends that offensives by rebels in northern Syria and by foreign trained rebels in the vicinity of Damascus have caused serious alarm among regime leaders since mid-August. United Nations officials cite estimates that over 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict. As many as 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced inside the country and more than 2 million Syrian refugees are in neighboring countries. The Syrian conflict and the humanitarian crisis it has created have deepened the economic and political challenges facing the region and exacerbated sectarian tensions and violence, particularly in Iraq and Lebanon. To date, the United States has provided over $1 billion in humanitarian aid in Syria and neighboring countries, with U.N. appeals seeking over $4 billion in assistance. President Obama called for Syrian President Bashar al Asad's resignation in August 2011, but, as noted above, the Obama Administration has rejected calls for more direct U.S. intervention in Syria. Nevertheless, the intensifying regional costs of the Syrian crisis and reports of chemical weapons use by Syrian government forces have placed increasing pressure on the Obama Administration to respond. Secretary Kerry has signaled that the Administration may seek to further augment U.S. support to some opposition elements in parallel with any limited military operations focused on chemical weapons. In the 113 th Congress, some Members have introduced proposed legislation that would authorize expanded assistance to the opposition. H.R. 1327 , the Free Syria Act of 2013, would, among other things, authorize the President, under certain conditions and with various reporting and certification requirements, to supply nonlethal and/or lethal support to Syrian opposition groups. S. 960 , the Syria Transition Support Act of 2013, would, among other things, authorize the President, notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts assistance to Syria, to provide assistance, including defense articles, defense services, and training to vetted opposition forces. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved S. 960 as amended by a 15-3 vote in May 2013. Proposed Authorizations for the Use of Military Force Current debate focuses on the possible ramifications of an authorization for the use of military force with regard to Syria. Key subjects of debate include the purposes of any such authorization; potential location and targets of military force; the type of force that may be employed, including whether or not U.S. ground forces are authorized; the potential duration of military operations; and the resources available for such operations. Historical Perspective Legal scholars have continually compared and contrasted congressional authorizations of the use of force over time, and generally categorize them in terms of their relative limits on or permissiveness of executive authority and action. According to one study: The primary differences between limited and broad authorizations are as follows: In limited authorizations, Congress restricts the resources and methods of force that the President can employ, sometimes expressly restricts targets, identifies relatively narrow purposes for the use of force, and sometimes imposes time limits or procedural restrictions. In broad authorizations, Congress imposes few if any limits on resources or methods, does not restrict targets other than to identify an enemy, invokes relatively broad purposes, and generally imposes few if any timing or procedural restrictions. Some argue, however, that provisions attempting to circumscribe the President's ability to conduct military operations improperly interfere with the President's commander-in-chief powers under Article II of the Constitution. Past cases suggest that limits on appropriations may provide the most direct and effective means of asserting congressional control over military operations. For CRS analysis of these questions, see \" War Powers \" below and CRS Report R41989, Congressional Authority to Limit Military Operations , by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RL31133, Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications , by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. Current Proposals and the Situation in Syria For a side-by-side comparison of three proposed resolutions to authorize the use of military force in Syria with commentary, see the Appendix . The following analysis is based on texts available as of September 6, 2013. As described above, a draft resolution authorizing the use of force submitted to Congress by the White House would authorize the President: to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria in order to \u2013 (1) prevent or deter the use or proliferation (including the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors), within, to or from Syria, of any weapons of mass destruction, including chemical or biological weapons or components of or materials used in such weapons; or (2) protect the United States and its allies and partners against the threat posed by such weapons. Alternate proposals are under consideration in both the Senate and House of Representatives. On September 4, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee debated and adopted, by a vote of 10-7 (with one \"present\") a resolution ( S.J.Res. 21 ) to authorize the President, subject to required certifications, to:  use the Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines to be necessary and appropriate in a limited and specified manner against legitimate military targets in Syria, only to\u2014 (1) respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction by the Government of Syria in the conflict in Syria;  (2) deter Syria's use of such weapons in order to protect the national security interests of the United States and to protect United States allies and partners against the use of such weapons;  (3) degrade Syria's capacity to use such weapons in the future; and  (4) prevent the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors within Syria of any weapons of mass destruction. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposal states that it does not \"authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Syria for the purpose of combat operations.\" The resolution does not define \"combat operations.\" It remains unclear whether the resolution as reported by the committee would authorize members of the U.S. Armed Forces to operate on the ground in Syria in non-combatant (i.e., advisory, logistical, intelligence, or other enabling) roles to carry out the purposes specified in the resolution. As reported, the resolution includes a sunset clause of 60 days for the authorization, with provision for one 30-day extension. Representatives Chris Van Hollen and Gerald Connolly have circulated a draft authorization for the use of military force that would authorize the President \"to use the United States Armed Forces to prevent and deter the further use of chemical weapons in Syria or by Syria against any other group or country.\" The authorization would expire \"upon the conclusion of each military action conducted by the United States Armed Forces beginning after the initial military action conducted by the United States Armed Forces\" unless the President certifies to Congress in writing that the President finds \"with high confidence\" that Syria has used chemical weapons subsequent to the conclusion of \"the immediately preceding military action conducted by the United States Armed Forces.\" As of September 4, the draft proposal does not define \"military action.\" The authorization would expire completely after 60 days. With regard to Syria, matters for possible consideration may include whether or not allies of the Syrian government, such as Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, or other non-state actors who may gain access to chemical or biological weapons or components, are intended as potential targets of U.S. military action and if so, what the implications of conflict with those actors might be. The costs and duration of any potential operation may be relevant, as well as the potential for retaliatory action by the Syrian government and its supporters that could threaten allies to whom the United States has made various security commitments, including Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.  Secretary of State Kerry also has discussed some hypothetical contingencies, including the prospect that U.S. forces may be required to act to secure Syria's stockpiles of chemical weapons. The Administration has not indicated in recent testimony whether such actions may require U.S. \"boots on the ground.\" In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he said,  in the event Syria imploded, for instance, or in the event there was a threat of a chemical weapons cache falling into the hands of al-Nusra or someone else, and it was clearly in the interests of our allies and all of us -- the British, the French and others -- to prevent those weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of the worst elements, I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country. Congress also may wish to assess criteria for measuring the success of any specific planned action and how such action fits within broader U.S. regional and international policy goals; for example if limited strikes fail to deter or prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons in Syria, will the United States pursue continued or wider military action? Similarly, if the Syrian government refrains from further use of chemical weapons but continues indiscriminate attacks on rebel held areas using conventional weaponry, will a limited U.S. military action be deemed successful? What effect might strikes on Syrian military targets have on the current dynamics of the Syrian civil war and how might rebel groups, whether moderate or extremist, potentially exploit U.S. military action? Issues for Congress Chemical Weapons Issues18 On the night of August 21, an alleged chemical weapons attack killed hundreds in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Damascus. If confirmed, this would be the largest number of casualties from a chemical weapons attack in this conflict to date. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France have issued statements saying that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in the attack. The White House released a detailed intelligence assessment on August 30. As with past cases of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria this year, the Syrian government denied that it had conducted the attack and blamed opposition groups. Most experts observing the victims of the attack say that symptoms are consistent with the use of the nerve agent sarin, a type of chemical weapon in Syria's large arsenal.  The August 30, 2013, White House statement said that the U.S. intelligence community assesses that the Asad regime used a nerve agent in a \"large-scale coordinated rocket and artillery attack,\" which killed approximately 1,429 people. It also said that the opposition has not used chemical weapons. The U.S. government assesses that the Asad regime has used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year. These assessments say that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons \"primarily to gain the upper hand or break a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold strategically valuable territory.\"  President Obama and other world leaders have said that the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population would be met with consequences, which could include the use of military force. In statements reacting to alleged chemical weapons incidents in Syria, U.S. officials have referred to several distinct reasons why the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government raises fundamental concerns for the United States:  the unacceptability of any use of chemical weapons, given the large international consensus that views chemical weapons as having inherently malicious qualities; the targeting of a civilian population, especially in large numbers, regardless of the weapons employed; the potential for the proliferation of chemical weapons to other parties, such as those hostile to the United States; and the potential ramifications of escalated or expanded violence in Syria, including the loss of control of chemical weapons and/or their use on neighboring countries and U.S. interests in the region. These concerns are reflective of major trends in national security strategy from the past decade, including intervention on humanitarian grounds, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, and the upholding of international nonproliferation norms. What is the status of the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors report on Syria? A team of United Nations (U.N.) chemical weapons inspectors went to Syria to examine several sites where attacks were alleged to occur. The inspectors collected samples from the sites, including the site of the August 21 attack, and those samples are being studied. The team's mandate is not to assess who used the weapons, but rather to determine to the extent possible whether or not chemical weapons were used and what type. According to the U.N., the inspectors are to \"collect as many facts as possible and assess the nature of the extent of any attack using chemical weapons and its consequences.\" The determination of what chemical agents were used could also be used to draw conclusions on the source of the agents (i.e., weaponized sarin versus organo-phosphates from fertilizer or other chemicals). The inspectors were invited to Syria by the Syrian government, but they only arrived in the country on August 18\u2014just before the apparent August 21 attack\u2014after months of negotiating terms of access for the inspections. Press reports say the team will issue its report next week. Was it too late for U.N. investigators to collect evidence? Media reports have noted that the Syrian military continued to bomb the site of the August 21 attack with conventional weapons. While some physical evidence may have been destroyed at the site, blood and tissue samples from the victims themselves would help the inspectors determine what chemical agent was used. An August 27 United Kingdom joint intelligence committee assessment says, \"There is no immediate time limit over which environmental or physiological samples would have degraded beyond usefulness. However, the longer it takes inspectors to gain access to the affected sites, the more difficult it will be to establish the chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The U.N. inspectors were reportedly given access to the site and to victims of the attack. What evidence is used to determine CW use? White House statements have described the types of information that has gone into the intelligence assessments about the April 2013 use of sarin. Both the June and August 2013 intelligence assessments have said these sources of information included reporting about Syrian military attack planning and execution, descriptions of attacks, physiological symptoms consistent with exposure to chemical weapons agents, and analysis of physiological samples from multiple victims. Congress may wish to ask the Administration for information on the credibility of this evidence.  What countries have chemical weapons? What international norms exist against their use? The U.S. intelligence community cites Iran, North Korea, and Syria as having active chemical weapons programs. For decades, there has been a strong norm against the use of chemical weapons. For the past 25 years, no chemical weapons have been used in civil or cross-border warfare. Most countries that have had chemical weapons arsenals in the past have destroyed these weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), or are in the process of destroying them. The CWC addresses the destruction of existing stocks, prevention of proliferation to new states, and assistance to countries that are victims of an attack, but does not prescribe consequences for CW use. Syria is not a party to the CWC. When were chemical weapons last used on civilians? The Iraqi government used chemical weapons in an attack on Kurdish civilians in the town of Halabja, northern Iraq, on March 16, 1988, killing an estimated 5,000 people. This is considered the largest chemical attack against a civilian population since German atrocities during World War II. The United States did not respond militarily to the attack. Iraq also systematically used chemical weapons against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s without a U.S. or international military response.  What has the Obama Administration said about the importance of the August 21 case? As has been widely reported in the press and in public statements, the Obama Administration has emphasized that it believes this particular use of chemical weapons may necessitate a response of some kind. Echoing a similar statement he made in August 2012, President Obama stated in an interview on August 28, 2013, that \"I have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria, but we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable.\" The Administration has confirmed the use of the nerve agent sarin in incidents earlier this year; however, the August 21 attack killed civilians on a larger scale than in past incidents. The Administration has stated that it aims to deter future use of these weapons by Syria and others, as well as to prevent these weapons from being diverted to terrorists or used against U.S. interests or allies in the region. The Administration has also emphasized the norm against the use of chemical weapons. Secretary Kerry said in a speech on August 26 that \"all peoples and all nations who believe in the cause of our common humanity must stand up to assure that there is accountability for the use of chemical weapons so that it never happens again.\" These views were reiterated in more extensive remarks by the Secretary on August 30, discussed above. However, although media speculation about possible military action abounds, U.S. officials have not directly provided specifics on what kind of response might take place and how that response could prevent future use of chemical weapons in Syria or elsewhere.  Could the United States destroy Syria's chemical weapons stocks through military action? What would be needed to secure chemical weapons sites during an intervention? While it is possible that military strikes could render chemical weapons agents unusable, according to many observers, there would be considerable risk to nearby civilian populations if Syrian chemical weapons facilities were attacked in a military strike from the air. This is because nerve agents could be dispersed into the air in the course of any strike against these facilities. One major concern of the United States is the risk that chemical weapons would fall into the hands of terrorist groups if the Syrian military lost control of or diverted them. The scale of the CW stocks in Syria would present a great challenge for physical security. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in a July letter to Congress that \"[t]housands of special operations forces and other ground forces would be needed to assault and secure critical sites.\" The operation would result in the \"control of some, but not all chemical weapons\" and \"would also help prevent their further proliferation into the hands of extremist groups,\" the letter said. U.S. military efforts to date have focused on bolstering security near Syria's borders with neighboring countries such as Jordan and Turkey, perhaps partly to help deter any transfer of chemical weapons out of Syria. What international legal instruments ban chemical weapons use? Chemical weapons have been banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) since 1997. The CWC bans the development, production, transfer, stockpiling, and use of chemical and toxin weapons, mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons production facilities, and seeks to control the production and international transfer of the key chemical components of these weapons. The 189 member states may ask for assistance and protection if they are attacked with chemical weapons. The following countries are not parties to the CWC: Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea, South Sudan, and Syria.  The 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare bans the use of chemical or biological agents in warfare against other states, but does not address the use of these weapons in internal conflicts. Syria did sign the Geneva Protocol. How would the international community take control of and destroy the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile? The Syrian government has reportedly accepted a proposal by Russia that it turn over all its chemical weapons to international control. The United Nations Security Council may discuss proposals to accomplish this goal. President Obama said on September 10 that any deal would have to ensure \"verifiable and enforceable destruction.\" Key issues would be verification, access, and security of international personnel. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is the international agency that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons once a state has joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. Because Syria is not yet a party to that convention, it would either have to join the CWC or a separate disarmament mechanism may be set up directly by the U.N. Security Council, as happened with Iraq in 1991 (U.N. Security Council Resolution 687). This would most likely use the OPCW as an implementing organization for verification and dismantlement.  The United Nations and the OPCW have had experience successfully monitoring the destruction of chemical weapons in several countries. In most cases, the country would first declare its stocks and production facilities, and then destroy the weapons under international supervision. The inspectors would verify that the amounts declared were then destroyed. In the case of Syria, as with Iraq in the 1990s, the U.N. Security Council may also mandate that Syria give access to sites that have not been declared but are suspected of holding chemical weapons. However, because Syria is in the midst of civil war, there are many risk factors that have not been present in other cases. First, a top priority is securing the chemical weapons stocks themselves. Second, the inspectors would be at great physical risk without a ceasefire in place. The conflict also would limit access of inspectors to sites of suspicion. Third, destruction of chemical weapons is a time-consuming, expensive process with great need for safety precautions. Therefore, the initial stage may focus on securing the chemical weapons at predetermined locations or shipped out of the country for storage awaiting destruction. It is not clear who would be guarding this centralized storage locations if they were inside Syria.  In addition, due to the fear that the Assad regime is using the chemical weapons destruction proposal as a way to stave off military strikes, the United States and others may choose to set deadlines for certain steps.  What did the French government propose to the U.N. Security Council? On September 10, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced France's intention to present a U.N. Security Council Resolution that would call on the Asad government to dismantle its chemical weapons program. Fabius said the resolution would be proposed under the auspices of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which would allow member states to use all possible means, including military action, to enforce it. Among other things, the resolution would (1) condemn the August 21 chemical weapons attack and punish the perpetrators of the attack in the international justice system; (2) demand that the Asad government's chemical weapons program be placed under international control and be dismantled, with mechanisms for inspection and monitoring; and (3) provide for \"extremely serious\" consequences for Syrian violation of its obligations under this agreement. Press reports say that the draft resolution France has presented to the U.N. Security Council would give Syria 15 days to issue a full declaration of its chemical weapons and facilities and open those facilities immediately to international inspectors. CRS has not independently verified the proposed draft text. The version described in press reports would also authorize measures under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter if Syria does not comply. It would appear that the U.N. Secretary General would retain the lead role in inspecting chemical facilities in coordination with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. This may be to avoid a possible delay while Syria took the necessary legal steps to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which requires member states to declare and destroy their chemical weapons. As noted above, Russian officials reportedly have rejected elements of the French proposal and discussions are ongoing concerning the way forward. War Powers26 Any deployment of U.S. Armed Forces into the territory, airspace, or waters of Syria implicates generally the war powers vested in Congress under the Constitution, the foremost of which is the authority to declare war. What are the roles and responsibilities of Congress and the President pursuant to the provisions of the War Powers Resolution? The War Powers Resolution, as amended (WPR; P.L. 93-148 ), is intended to provide a process for congressional-executive branch cooperation and the assertion of congressional oversight and authority related to involving U.S. Armed Forces in armed conflict. The WPR requires the President to consult with Congress prior to introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or situations in which hostilities are imminent, and to report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate within 48 hours of: introducing U.S. Armed Forces into current or imminent hostilities; deploying combat-equipped U.S. Armed Forces into a foreign country's territory, airspace, or waters; or increasing substantially the number of U.S. Armed Forces already located in a foreign country. Such report is required to include the reasons necessitating such actions, the President's authority to undertake such actions, and the estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or other involvement. Authority to use force, according to the WPR, is not to be inferred from other provisions of law or treaties unless those instruments specifically authorize the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces that has occurred in each circumstance. The WPR states that unless Congress enacts a declaration of war or statutory authorization for the use of force, or Congress cannot convene due to an attack on the United States, the President must withdraw U.S. Armed Forces 60 days after introducing them into current or imminent hostilities. The 60-day period begins the day the President was required to report to Congress on such introduction of U.S. Armed Forces. The President may extend the period by 30 days to safely withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities. Each President since the WPR's enactment has refused to concede that this withdrawal requirement is appropriate under the Constitution, presumably given its possible interference with the President's powers as commander-in-chief under Article II. The WPR provides for expedited consideration of legislative proposals to either authorize continuing the involvement of U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities through joint resolution, or to require a withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces at any time after introduction of such forces through a concurrent resolution. The use of the concurrent resolution to require U.S. Armed Forces withdrawal is considered to be an example of a \"legislative veto,\" a mechanism that has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court when included in other legislation. What are some possible considerations if Congress takes up authorization for the use of military force against Syria? A congressional declaration of war against Syria is seen as unlikely, given historical practice since World War II. If Congress considers a proposal to statutorily authorize the use of force against Syria, it might consider provisions to specify the purpose of such authorization and the objectives of the use of military force, and to place limits on the scope and duration of such authorization. It is asserted generally that statutory authorizations place the President in a stronger position legally and politically to prosecute armed conflict.  Congress has included provisions limiting the use of funds for the military in defense authorization and appropriation acts, and could include them in an authorization for use of force in Syria. H.J.Res. 58 , introduced on September 9, 2013, would state that:  No funds available to any United States Government department or agency may be used for the use of force in, or directed at, Syria by the United States Armed Forces unless a subsequent Act of Congress specifically authorizes such use of force or there is an attack or imminent attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or the United States Armed Forces. Some argue, however, that any provisions attempting to circumscribe the President's ability to conduct military operations would improperly interfere with the President's commander-in-chief powers under Article II of the Constitution. In any case, if Congress does not otherwise act to limit appropriations that can be used to continue such military operations, constricting provisions in an authorization to use force will likely fail to limit the President's ability to continue any commenced military operations in Syria.  Cost and Budgetary Resources for Intervention27 Since the President's September 10, 2013, speech on Syria, congressional concerns have broadened to include the potential costs and funding sources that would be tapped to carry out either various U.S. military actions in Syria or to secure Syria's chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles and eliminate its CW capabilities. Speaker of the House John Boehner, for example, raised the question of whether the Administration plans to submit a supplemental appropriations request to Congress if \"the scope and duration of the potential military strikes exceed the initial planning\" in an August 28, 2013, letter to President Obama.  In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 3, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry said that President Obama is asking for authorization \"to degrade and deter Bashar al Asad's capacity to use chemical weapons,\" with no American boots on the ground; Secretary Hagel characterized the operation as \"limited in duration and scope . . . [and] tailored to respond to the use of chemical weapons.\" Details about specific military plans have not been made publicly available so estimating the cost is speculative at this point with some potential benchmarks based on the bombing of Libya in March 2011. In response to a question about whether members of the Arab League supporting U.S. operations would \"offset any of the costs,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said that some of the Arab countries have offered to \"bear costs and to assist . . . and to [possibly] carry that cost.\" In recent days, some observers have suggested that the cost of securing and destroying Syria's chemical weapons stocks and possibly deliver options could be substantial but there is considerable uncertainty about both the potential cost and the sharing of those costs.  The cost of any military intervention or to secure chemical weapons stocks could range widely depending on the type and length of U.S. military actions or role in providing force protection in chemical disarmament efforts, the participation and cost-sharing by U.S. allies, and Syrian and Syrian-allied responses. Funding sources could also vary depending not only on the amount required, but also the timing. Congressional participation in decision making on costs depends on whether the Administration (1) taps currently available funding for FY2013, which appears unlikely now; (2) uses appropriations provided in FY2014 if actions take place after October 1, 2013; or (3) requests reprogrammings of existing funds or supplemental appropriations. The availability of funds may also be affected by the timing as well as the scope of costs since it is now close to the last month of the FY2013, and the Department of Defense is closely tracking funds so as to implement required sequestration cuts.  What are the range and factors that would affect the potential cost of U.S. military intervention in Syria? In a July 19, 2013, response to a letter from Senators Levin and Inhofe, chair and ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined the costs of various military options but did not recommend any particular option since this is a presidential decision. According to his letter, costs could range from $500 million initially to train, advise, and assist opposition forces in a safe area outside Syria to \"as much as a billion dollars per month over the course of a year\" (up to $12 billion) to use military force to establish either a no-fly zone that would prevent the regime from using its military aircraft or a buffer zone to protect border areas next to Turkey or Jordan.  General Dempsey estimated the cost could be \"billions\" to conduct a major military campaign that appears to more extensive than the limited strike that the Administration was considering. He described that option as using \"lethal force to strike targets that enable the regime to conduct military operations, proliferate advanced weapons, and defend itself,\" by destroying military forces and units, air defense, military facilities, or headquarters. This range of options shows that the factors affecting cost include the scope of military operations (e.g., the numbers and types of forces used), and the length of the operation, which may, in turn, depend on Syrian and allied responses, as well as any participation or cost-sharing by allies.  In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on September 4, 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that DOD provided a range of costs based on different options and that the current option (of a limited strike) \"would [cost] in the tens of millions of dollars, that kind of range.\" On September 4, 2013, two days later, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert suggested that the naval costs of the Syrian operation are \"not extraordinary at this point,\" partly because many of the ships involved were already forward-deployed so that their costs would already be covered in the budget but that lengthening the deployment of the Nimitz carrier and replenishing Tomahawk missiles used, which cost about $1.5 million each, could add costs.  Some observers have questioned whether these informal estimates that costs of a strike would be minimal costs are realistic. The resolution authorizing the use of force in Syria, as revised and reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requires that the President report to Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations and the House Foreign Affairs on both the status of the operation, and the \"financial costs of operations to date ten days after initiation of military operations and every 20 days thereafter until completion.\" What are the range and factors that would affect the potential cost of disarming Syria's chemical weapons capability? In the July 19, 2013, letter, General Dempsey also estimated that destroying portions of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles could require more than $1 billion a month because \"hundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines, and other enablers\" and \"thousands of special operations forces and other ground forces\" would be needed to secure critical sites. This estimate may have reflected a DOD study conducted and reported to the White House in late 2012, according to press reports, that estimated that a military effort to seize Syrian weapons stocks would require \"upwards of 75,000 troops.\" Recent press reports have repeated this 75,000 figure as suggesting that the costs of securing Syrian weapons stocks would be substantial.  This estimate of 75,000 U.S. troops does not appear to be an apt analogy because it assumes forcible entry by the United States. That scenario is very different from the international effort currently in the early stages of negotiation that is exploring a chemical disarmament effort that would be conducted with Syrian agreement under international auspices. The potential U.S. cost of such an effort would depend on Syria's agreement about who would participate in such an effort, which would provide force protection for inspectors, potential cost-sharing of inspection costs that could be conducted by a combination of government and contractor personnel, and the extent and length of the effort. While the potential costs of chemical disarmament could well be greater than a limited military strike, it is not possible at this stage to estimate those costs. What funding sources are available for U.S. military intervention in Syria? With the end of FY2013 fast approaching, it is unlikely that FY2013 funds will be tapped for either a limited military strike, temporarily off-the-table, or a chemical disarmament effort, a fact recently noted by Secretary of Defense Hagel. Funding sources would likely be FY2014 funds, reprogramming of available funds, or supplemental appropriations if expenses to conduct military intervention or chemically disarm Syria proved to be substantial. These options would be available for either a limited military strike or a chemical disarmament effort though the scope and timing of a chemical disarmament effort are unknown at this time.  According to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, the United States now has \"moved assets in place,\" including four DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers in the Mediterranean, that could meet \"whatever [military] option the president wishes to take.\" To the extent that DOD relies on U.S. military assets now or planned to be in-place to conduct military operations, the cost of deploying those ships (military personnel, fuel, spare parts) is presumably funded with FY2013 DOD appropriations for Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) that were provided in the FY2013 Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L. 113-6 ). The deployment of the four destroyers to the Mediterranean in preparation for Syrian operations appears to be part of the Navy's planned peacetime presence mission, and for that reason would be funded within the Navy's base budget for regular activities rather than Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) or Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which pays for incremental war costs primarily for the Afghan war.  Brief U.S. military operations to establish a no-fly zone conducted in Libya in 2011 relied almost exclusively on existing appropriations. DOD's estimated costs were about $800 million, including offsets or savings from lower peacetime flying hours during operations. The Administration also estimated that the short-lived Libyan operation would not have significant operational impacts on the Afghan or Iraq wars. The Administration did not request supplemental appropriations for Libyan operations, relying instead on available funds and existing inventories of munitions. There is no restriction that prevents the President from using available funds to conduct wartime operations. DOD transferred OCO funds originally appropriated for another purpose to replenish the inventory of missiles expended in that operation at a later date after receiving approval from the four congressional defense committees. However, possible U.S. military intervention in Syria could be significantly different from the 2011 Libyan operation. If the scope of operations and costs proved to be larger than the Libyan operation, the Department of Defense could face some difficulties in accommodating costs within its existing budget or by shifting funds among activities\u2014particularly in view of sequestration, which was not applicable in 2011. This could also be complicated because there is uncertainty about the enactment of FY2014 appropriations. If Congress enacts a Continuing Resolution for FY2014, that funding would be available for Syrian military operations by \"cash flowing,\" a term sometimes often used by budget officials that means using currently available funds that may have been intended for either peacetime or Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) operations.  If the cost of military intervention in Syria proved to be larger than anticipated, DOD could shift funds from less urgent programs or activities by using reprogramming authority provided in DOD's annual authorization and appropriations acts. Moving funds from one appropriations account to another or, in some cases, from one type of activity to another requires the written approval of the four congressional defense committees. If the costs of the operation expanded further, the Administration might need to request supplemental appropriations, which would require full congressional approval. How might Congress limit funding for either a limited strike or a chemical disarmament effort? In addition to voting on any supplemental appropriations should they prove necessary, Congress can and has placed restrictions on the use of funds in any appropriations bill. Such restrictions can prohibit obligating (putting on contract or paying civilians) or expending (spending or outlays) funds and can be included in any appropriations act.  Past statutory language has included funding restrictions that apply: to all or only specific types of military operations (e.g., combat), or particular types of activities; after a particular date or passage of time, or are contingent on certain events taking place (e.g., negotiation of a cease-fire) or a presidential determination. Finally, funding prohibitions can be applied to the funds in a particular bill, all previous bills, or any appropriation act. Restrictions can also be placed in authorization acts.  Most recently, Representative Ted Poe introduced a resolution, H.J.Res. 58 , that states that No funds available to any United States Government department or agency may be used for the use of force in, or directed at, Syria by the United States Armed Forces unless a subsequent Act of Congress specifically authorizes such use of force or there is an attack or imminent attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or the United States Armed Forces. This amendment prohibiting the use of funds for a military actions would apply broadly\u2014to all enacted appropriations acts, past or FY2014 when enacted, with an exception should a congressional authorization be passed or in the case of a direct attack on the United States.  While the recently proposed Manchin-Heitkamp resolution ( S.J.Res. 22 ) does not directly include a funding restriction, it states that it is U.S. policy that the United States can consider using \"all elements of national power,\" (presumably referring to military action) only if the Syrian government does not sign and comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention within 45 days. This follows the pattern of prohibitions that are contingent on certain conditions and the passage of time.  How might the cost of Syrian military intervention or chemical disarmament efforts be affected by ongoing sequestration cuts in FY2013 or in FY2014 if sequestration again occurs?  Since current ship deployments in the Mediterranean are largely following current plans (with minor adjustments in schedule), ongoing sequestration cuts would not necessarily have an effect on the option of a limited military strike. In addition, the Administration's and DOD's policy has been to minimize effects on DOD's core readiness-related activities such as those deployments. The President also exempted military personnel accounts from sequestration for both FY2013 and FY2014.  The services have focused ongoing sequestration cuts on lower priority Operation & Maintenance (O&M) activities such as travel, conferences, non-training flying hours, facility upgrades, Information Technology, and depot maintenance. Although the services initially reduced some training activities to meet sequestration cuts, many of these cuts were later reversed as savings became available in other areas. At the same time, some Members of Congress and DOD spokesmen have raised concerns about readiness in later years from the current sequestration or from later cuts to the DOD budget in FY2014, which could be exacerbated by a lengthy Syrian intervention.  If Congress were to enact supplemental appropriations to cover the cost of Syrian military intervention or chemical disarmament efforts, and designated that funding as emergency, those monies would not be subject to the budget caps in the Budget Control Act (BCA). On the other hand, if Congress does not meet BCA caps, FY2014 sequestration cuts would be levied by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in early January 2014 and funds for any operations involving Syria would be part of the budgetary resources subject to those cuts. As in the case of Afghan war costs, however, DOD could choose to shield those costs from cuts by levying higher reductions on other operational activities. Military Planning48 As of September 6, U.S. military planning information is, in unclassified sources, largely speculative. Congress may, as the situation warrants, consider the following questions regarding its role in relation to U.S. and allied military plans: Which strategic objectives are proposed military operations designed to secure? How are the proposed operations tailored to meet those specific objectives? What targets would U.S. or allied military forces strike in Syria? Why? What would constitute success and how would that success advance broader U.S. policy objectives in Syria, in the region, and internationally? What would constitute failure and how might that affect U.S. objectives? Should an authorization for the use of military force be limited in terms of purpose, territory, potential targets, potential means, potential cost, or potential duration? Why or why not? Does the Administration believe that the draft authorization submitted to Congress would allow it to conduct military operations outside of Syria? Against non-state actors in Syria or elsewhere? Against the military forces of governments other than Syria? What U.S. forces and capabilities are currently able to engage targets in Syria? What potential coalition forces and capabilities are available? Which countries are willing to take part in military strikes? Which countries are willing to allow their territory, waters, and airspace to be used to facilitate proposed operations? With what conditions? How do the current prospects for international support impact the U.S. military mission in terms of risk, cost, feasibility, and likely duration? What force might the Syrian government bring to bear to resist or respond to a military operation against it? How might Syrian allies such as Russia, Iran, and non-state actors like Hezbollah respond to any U.S. military intervention? How might extremist groups seek to take advantage of any U.S. operations? How might opposition groups receiving U.S. support benefit or be put at risk by U.S. military operations? What are the \"known unknowns\" with regard to a potential U.S. military response to the alleged use of chemical weapons? Who are the most capable armed groups operating in Syria? What are their long-term political goals? Should proposed military operations be conducted in conjunction with an increase in direct support to armed or unarmed opposition groups? Why or why not? How can the United States best limit opportunities for violent extremist groups to take advantage of any proposed military strike? What threats to U.S. security and regional security might follow from these groups in the event of regime change? What have leaders in Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar told the Administration regarding their individual views of the August 21 incident and the proposed U.S. response? How does the Administration envision assisting other countries in mitigating the impact of any potential retaliation or provocation? If the U.S. conducts military strike operations in Syria, what are the next steps that military forces would take? Is the U.S. military in a position to sustain military operations in the region? Given the impact of sequestration on U.S. military operations and maintenance, as well as the continued deployment of military assets in support of operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, are U.S. forces fully prepared to undertake both planned and contingent military operations in Syria? Would the possible dedication of already constrained U.S. military and/or DOD-contracted commercial airlift and sealift to a Syrian contingency operation have an adverse impact on U.S. retrograde operations currently underway in Afghanistan? What are some military options reportedly under consideration?49 Several media reports indicate that the United States is considering a military strike against Syria in response to the regime's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians on August 21. Numerous accounts suggest that the strategic goal of such a punitive strike would be to deter future chemical weapons use and degrade the Assad regime's capabilities to carry out future attacks. Some analysts question whether limited strikes can successfully accomplish the strategic objective of deterrence. For example, Chris Harmer, a senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, has argued that \"the Assad regime has shown an incredible capacity to endure pain and I don't think we have the stomach to deploy enough punitive action that would serve as a deterrent.\"  A report by the RAND Corporation outlined five broad possible missions for a Syrian attack using airpower. They included negating Syrian airpower; neutralizing Syrian air defenses; defending \"safe areas\" within Syria; enabling opposition forces to defeat the regime; and preventing the use of Syrian chemical weapons. These missions are in many ways complementary. The United States has developed munitions specifically designed to neutralize chemical weapons. Called \"agent defeat munitions,\" these devices use a large, high-temperature fireball to incinerate chemical agents. CRS has not yet been able to determine the number of such munitions currently in U.S. inventory. However, their potential use may be complicated by several factors:  First, the current generation of agent defeat munitions is believed to be deliverable only by aircraft, not cruise missiles; whether the United States would engage in air strikes without first suppressing Syrian air defenses is questionable. Second, due to their limited range of effects, agent defeat munitions require a precise knowledge of where the chemical weapons are stored. Syria is believed to have dispersed its chemical stocks in recent days. Third, a direct attack on chemical stocks raises the possibility of a collateral release of chemical agent. However, degrading Syria's capability to employ chemical weapons would not necessarily require strikes on the chemical stockpiles themselves. Potential U.S. attacks against the command and control network used to direct chemical use; the missiles, rocket launchers, and aircraft potentially used to deliver such weapons; and Syrian military command centers could all \"degrade\" Syria's CW capabilities without risking collateral release of chemical agents. \"Deterring\" further chemical use by Syria is a more complicated prospect, as it depends on understanding what could affect the Syrian command's calculations of gain vs. loss when considering whether to again employ chemical weapons. However, some strike options are viable and offer significant deterrent value. For example, a strike designed to degrade or disrupt Syria's air defense network could leave Syria exposed, with its leaders conscious of the potential for severe retaliation following any further CW use. Similarly, an attack to destroy the Syrian air force would reduce Syria's ability to deliver some types of chemical weapons, while also inhibiting its ability to defend against air attacks and to prosecute the civil war from the air. The Institute for the Study of War planned a notional strike to \"significantly degrade\" the Syrian air force. While not necessarily the U.S. plan, it gives a rough idea of the munitions required for such a strike. The plan required 133 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM), 24 Joint Stand-Off Weapons, and 24 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles. The Tomahawks could be launched from surface ships or submarines in the Mediterranean; the other weapons would be delivered by aircraft. The benefit of using so-called \"stand-off weapons\" such as a TLAM fired from a destroyer is that the firing vessel can be stationed beyond the range of Syrian anti-ship missiles. U.S. aircraft, such as the B-2 and B-52 bombers, also can carry air-launched cruise missiles.  Other proposed military options, such as establishing no-fly zones inside or outside Syria, may require a more extensive and longer-term U.S. commitment. According to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey, \"Lethal force would be required to defend the zones against air, missile, and ground attacks.... This would necessitate the establishment of a limited no-fly zone, with its associated resource requirements. Thousands of U.S. ground forces would be needed, even if positioned outside Syria, to support those physically defending the zones.\"  Operationally, Congress may wish to scrutinize the U.S. military's evaluation of the situation in evaluating a potential no-fly zone. In evaluating the situation, one may consider the nature and density of adversary air defenses, the quantity and quality of adversary air assets, geography, and availability of \"friendly\" assets. In evaluating adversaries, one may consider their strategy and tactics, their possible responses, their concept of operations, and their rules of engagement. If the United States and others were to conduct manned aerial strikes against Syria, the United States may employ its F-16 aircraft stationed in Jordan. Additionally, the Air Force's 39 th Air Base Wing is based at Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, and U.S. military action against Syria could originate from there, though it might require prior approval from Turkey's parliament. The United States may also have access to the British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus, where additional British military aircraft have been reportedly been deployed in recent days. If France were to take part in military action against Syria, it has access to an air base in the United Arab Emirates. U.S. Aid to the Opposition Arming the Syrian Opposition56  Secretary of Defense Hagel in a September 3, 2013, hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that the Administration is currently taking steps to provide arms to Syrian rebels under covert action authorities. On September 4, in a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"we have seen the president take steps in response to the initial attacks of chemical weapons to increase lethal aid to the opposition. That is now known.\" The statute concerning covert action thus shapes both how the Administration can intervene in Syria under those authorities and the way in which the Administration engages with Congress and the public about any intervention. What are the limits and extent of covert action authorities with respect to Syria? Covert action is defined in statute as \"an activity or activities of the United States Government to influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States Government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\" Section 503 of the National Security Act of 1947 authorizes the President to conduct covert action if that action is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States and is important to the national security of the United States. The statute requires the President to write a \"finding\" that specifies the identifiable foreign policy objectives. The President must provide the finding to the congressional intelligence committees as soon as possible and before the initiation of the covert action. The President is not required to provide the finding to Members who are not on the intelligence committees.  The \"apparent or acknowledged\" language in the statute may limit what the Administration is willing to say publicly about its aid to the Syria opposition. The language also provides a vague limitation on the extent to which covert action authorities can be utilized to broaden support for the opposition or to take additional action in Syria beyond aid to the opposition. During past covert actions in other countries, the role of the U.S. government has sometimes become apparent or acknowledged in the course of public debate. This has not always proven to be a limiting factor regarding whether covert action authorities are applicable. Nonetheless, the broader the U.S. actions and the more those actions require an Administration to make a case to the American public, the more difficult it may become to justify activities under these authorities. What organizations may conduct covert action? Although covert action is generally the domain of the Central Intelligence Agency, the statute does not identify specific departments or agencies that may conduct covert action. Executive Order 12333, concerning United States Intelligence Activities, notes that, \"No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, P.L. 93-148 ) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.\" Non-Lethal Aid to the Opposition and Economic Sanctions against the Regime61 The Administration's decision and the means otherwise available to provide material support to Syria's opposition\u2014in the form of humanitarian goods and services, non-lethal aid, or military assistance\u2014face obstacles from a robust U.S. economic sanctions regime maintained against Syria for decades. These sanctions were triggered by the Syrian government's support of international terrorism, poor human rights record, and weapons proliferation.  Considering the economic sanctions, can the United States currently provide foreign aid to the Syrian opposition? Laws authorizing U.S. foreign aid programs are constructed generally to provide assistance state-to-state, and Syria is explicitly prohibited from eligibility under current appropriations. The U.S. growing interest in supporting Syrian opposition forces is further complicated by international obligations that require the United States to control exports and identify end-users to meet standards relating to terrorism, regional stability, and weapons proliferation. The President, however, has authority, notwithstanding the restrictions, to provide humanitarian aid, fund emergency response efforts in neighboring states, contribute to multinational programs that are engaged in the international response to Syria's crisis, and reprogram assistance from other programs to those that address disasters or unanticipated events. Specific laws that the President can draw upon include: Section 2(c) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601(c)) authorizes the President to respond to \"unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs\" if he determines it is important to U.S. national interests to do so. Section 451 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2261) authorizes the President to draw upon up to $25 million in foreign aid in a fiscal year to respond to \"unanticipated contingencies....\" Current foreign operations appropriations (at Section 7034(f) of P.L. 112-74 , as continued and amended by P.L. 113-6 ) raises the Section 451 limit to $100 million for FY2013. Section 552(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)) authorizes the President to provide peacekeeping operations funds (up to $15 million in funds and up to $425 million in commodities and services in a fiscal year) to respond to any \"unforeseen emergency\" if he finds it \"important to the national interests\" to do so. Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2364) authorizes the President to provide assistance \"without regard\" to any other restriction in that Act or other foreign aid- or military aid-related laws if he finds it \"important to the security interests of the United States\" to do so. He may make up to $250 million available, but not more than $50 million to one country, in a given fiscal year. In addition, section 202(a) of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1722(a)) authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development to \"provide agricultural commodities to meet emergency food needs through governments and public or private agencies including intergovernmental organizations such as the World Food Program and other multilateral organizations....\" How has the Obama Administration been able to provide aid to Syria in recent years?63 Most U.S. foreign aid going to Syria is for humanitarian assistance. In FY2013, the United States is providing over $1 billion of humanitarian assistance and more than $250 million in non-humanitarian aid to the people of Syria to support the opposition. According to the Department of State, transfer authority for Overseas Contingency Operations provided within appropriations laws, and Section 451 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which authorizes the President to use up to $25 million in one fiscal year for unanticipated contingencies, has been and continues to be crucial for providing both humanitarian and non-humanitarian aid to Syria since 2011. Current foreign operations appropriations (at Section 7034(f) of P.L. 112-74 , as continued and amended by P.L. 113-6 ) raises the Section 451 limit to $100 million for FY2013. The Obama Administration has acknowledged the funding challenges that the Syria crisis presents and worked with Congress to increase the balances in global humanitarian assistance accounts in the FY2013 final appropriations bill to better meet Syria related needs. However, the Administration has not identified specific additional Syria assistance funding requests in its FY2014 appropriations budget and all indications suggest that the Administration intends to continue to fund Syria opposition assistance efforts on an ad hoc basis by presenting reprogramming requests and emergency contingency notifications to Congress.  The Administration did request $580 million for a new Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund (MENA IF) that would have provided a multiyear source of funding to respond to contingencies in Arab countries, including Syria, as needed. However, the House Appropriations Committee has declined to include funds for the Incentive Fund in its markup of H.R. 2855 . Senate appropriators similarly declined to provide funds and authorities for MENA IF as requested by the Administration and has proposed a $575 million Complex Foreign Crises Fund to meet region wide assistance needs in their markup of S. 1372 .  Who is involved with defining and implementing the U.S. sanctions regime? Congress enacts annual foreign operations appropriations, can amend restrictions stated in authorizations, and can enact legislation to incrementally or fully remove restrictions. The President can exercise any or all of the foreign aid authorities listed above. He also is authorized, under the National Emergencies Act (particularly 50 U.S.C. 1621) and the International Emergencies Economic Powers Act (particularly 50 U.S.C. 1702) to restrict all transactions any U.S. person or entity might enter into with Syria or designated individuals therein. The State Department oversees arms sales and transfers, visas, and U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs. The Department of Commerce issues export licenses after taking into consideration a recipient country's compliance with international standards relating to terrorism, regional stability, and proliferation. The Department of the Treasury controls financial transactions relating to trade and economic engagement, and is also guided by those international standards. U.S. Humanitarian Response64 The ongoing conflict in Syria has created one of the most pressing humanitarian crises in the world. An estimated 6.8 million people in Syria, almost one-third of the population, have been affected by the conflict, including more than 4.2 million displaced inside Syria and more than 2 million Syrians displaced as refugees with 97% fleeing to countries in the immediate surrounding region, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt, and other parts of North Africa. The situation is fluid and continues to worsen, while humanitarian needs are immense and increase daily. The United States has a critical role and voice regarding humanitarian access in Syria, the pace of humanitarian developments and contingency planning, support to neighboring countries that are hosting refugees, and burden sharing among donors. How much humanitarian assistance has the United States provided to date? The United States is the largest donor of humanitarian assistance and is part of the massive, international humanitarian operation in parts of Syria and in neighboring countries. In FY2012 and to date in FY2013, the United States has allocated more than $1 billion to meet humanitarian needs using existing funding from global humanitarian accounts and some reprogrammed funding. U.S. humanitarian policy is guided by concerns about humanitarian access and protection within Syria; the large refugee flows out of the country that strain the resources of neighboring countries (and could negatively impact the overall stability of the region); and the potential for further escalation and protraction of the humanitarian emergency. The international humanitarian response is immense and complex, but struggles to keep pace with urgent developments that have risen above anticipated needs. Access within Syria is severely constrained by violence and restrictions imposed by the Syrian government on the operations of humanitarian organizations. Two U.N. emergency appeals, which identify a total of $4.4 billion in humanitarian needs, are less than 47% funded.  What have been some of the possible humanitarian policy considerations for Congress to date? What effect might military action have on the humanitarian crisis? As U.S. policy makers and the international community deliberate over what, if any, actions they can or should take on the Syria crisis, possible humanitarian policy considerations for Congress include (1) issues related to U.S. resources and determination of priorities, including other humanitarian or foreign aid concerns and domestic needs; (2) and the potential costs and benefits of labeling or \"branding\" of humanitarian aid delivered to Syria so that recipients and possibly other actors are aware of its American origins. It is unclear what effect military action may have on the humanitarian situation in Syria and in the region. Since mid-August refugee outflows have increased in anticipation of foreign military strikes and an intensification of fighting inside Syria. International Response The United Nations Security Council66 Under the United Nations (U.N.) Charter, the U.N. Security Council is the primary mechanism for addressing issues related to the maintenance of international peace and security. Decisions of the Council are binding on member states. Adoption of resolutions is the most prevalent method for Council decision-making. The Council has 15 members\u2014five permanent (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, hereinafter \"P-5\") and 10 non-permanent (currently Argentina, Australia, Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Luxembourg, Morocco, Pakistan, Republic of Korea (South Korea), Rwanda, and Togo). Decisions on non-procedural or substantive matters require nine affirmative votes, including the concurring votes of the permanent members. Thus, a negative vote by any of the P-5 is a veto over adoption of a draft resolution. Few observers expect consensus on Syria to be reached among the P-5. Since the conflict began, both China and Russia have vetoed three draft Council resolutions addressing the conflict. The Council may meet to consider a proposal to enforce a chemical weapons disarmament agreement with Syria. What is the role of the Security Council in authorizing use of force?  Any Security Council decisions to authorize the use of force would likely be taken under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, entitled, \"Action with respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts of Aggression.\" Article 42 of this Chapter authorizes the Council to take \"action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.\" Such actions might include a variety of military operations by the forces of U.N. member states, including but not limited to demonstrations and blockades. Russia69 Russia has provided consistent diplomatic and military support to the Asad regime in Syria during the civil war. Russia recognizes the Asad regime as the currently legitimate government of Syria and asserts a sovereign right to provide arms to the regime under existing arms sales contracts. Russia also has a lease on a naval docking facility at Tartus, Syria. Russia has vetoed three U.N. Security Council (UNSC) resolutions aimed at addressing the Syrian conflict on the grounds that they would have unduly interfered with the domestically involved parties' efforts to reach a peaceful political solution to the conflict. How has Russia reacted to the potential for a military response by the United States? In an interview on September 3, 2013, President Putin made four points:  He asserted that Russia will only be convinced to support a resolution in the UNSC authorizing retaliation against Syria for chemical weapons use against civilians if the evidence is compelling beyond a shadow of a doubt, particularly since faulty data had been presented by the United States in the past as grounds for U.S. action in Iraq, he alleged. He also raised the possibility that the rebels may have gassed civilians to trigger Western action against the Asad government. He underlined that only the UNSC may approve the legitimate use of force against a sovereign state, and that the use of force outside U.N. approval is aggression. He stressed that Russia was not defending the Asad regime, but was upholding the norms and principles of international law, and warned that if illegitimate force is used against the Asad regime, there is a danger that it might again be used \"against anybody and on any pretext.\" He reiterated that Russia is supplying arms under contracts with the legitimate government of Syria, so is not violating any international laws. He admitted that some components of the S-300 surface-to-air missile system had been delivered, but the delivery of remaining components had been suspended. He stressed that Russia would not become militarily involved in the Syrian conflict. Supporting President Putin's statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry the next day reported that a Russian investigation into an alleged March 2013 chemical attack in Syria had found evidence that the rebels had used the gas against civilians and the Syrian Army, and the Ministry suggested that evidence pointed to the rebels in the case of the August 21 attack. During his testimony on September 3, 2013, before the SFRC, Secretary Kerry raised the hope that Presidents Obama and Putin would discuss Syria during the G-20 summit in Russia, and that President Putin would have a \"change of heart\" on Syria. The Secretary stated that Russia and the United States were cooperating on efforts toward a negotiated settlement of the Syria conflict. On September 4-5, 2013, the Russian government rejected U.S. and Polish government statements that the former Soviet Union and Russian sources had assisted Iraq in developing chemical weapons, with Russian presidential administration head Sergey Ivanov terming such statements \"raving nonsense,\" since Russia is against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Russian presidential press secretary on September 5 urged that the international community wait for the U.N. inspectors to issue their report on whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria. He stated that, based on this report, a further investigation could then be undertaken to determine who used them. On September 5, 2013, Deputy Defense Minister Anatoliy Antonov warned that any U.S. military action against Syria threatened tourists in the eastern Mediterranean, as well as commercial ships, and raised concerns that a U.S. missile might hit a Russian warship. He also warned that support for Syrian rebels will at least indirectly boost Syrian terrorist groups that will later expand their operations elsewhere in the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry also warned that U.S. missiles could threaten nuclear contamination if they hit a Syrian research reactor. Presidential administration head Ivanov stated on September 5 that warships being sent to the Mediterranean Sea were intended for the possible evacuation of Russian citizens from Syria. Deputy Defense Minister Antonov stressed that the deployment of more warships to the Mediterranean was aimed to cover possible contingencies that could threaten Russia's national interests, and \"to hold back other forces which are ready to unleash hostilities,\" but that Russia did not intend to become involved in conflict. The deployment includes intelligence-gathering and anti-submarine warfare vessels, a missile cruiser, a destroyer, and landing craft. Leaders of the Russian Federal Assembly (legislature) have received support from Putin for a planned delegation trip to the United States to try to convince Congress not to approve the use of military force against the Syrian government. Why did Russia block a recent draft UNSC resolution on Syria?  On August 28, Russia (and China) blocked discussion in the UNSC of a possible resolution introduced by the United Kingdom condemning the August 21 gas attack in Syria and authorizing necessary measures\u2014including military action\u2014to protect civilians, with Foreign Minister Lavrov stating that any such resolution should await the findings of the mission of U.N. inspectors. He stressed that possible military action in Syria without UNSC authorization would violate international law and vitiate efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, such as the planned Syrian government-rebel conference that was being organized by the United States and Russia prior to the gas attack. He also alleged that the chemical weapons attack may have been a provocation by the rebels, as Russia has asserted in previous cases, and warned that any Western military action could further destabilize the Middle East. China79 As one of the five veto-wielding permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, China's support or abstention is necessary for any Security Council actions related to the conflict in Syria. That would include any resolution to implement a Russian proposal that Syria put its chemical weapons under international control. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman has said that China welcomes and supports the Russian proposal, describing it as offering \"an important opportunity to ease the current tension and properly address the international community's concerns about Syria's chemical weapons.\"  China has consistently opposed outside military intervention in Syria in response to the August 21, 2013 chemical weapons attack. In a closed-door session of the Security Council on August 28, 2013, China joined Russia in blocking a resolution drafted by the U.K. government that would have authorized the use of force against the Syrian government. China has also spoken out against the possibility of the United States bypassing the United Nations and undertaking unilateral U.S. military action against the Asad regime. To do so, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said on September 12, 2013, \"goes against the international law and basic norms governing international relations and will add to turmoil in Syria and the region as a whole.\" What is Driving China's Syria Policy? China's opposition to outside military intervention in Syria is rooted in its long-standing policy of non-interference in the affairs of other sovereign nations. That policy is thought to be related to China's desire to head off any foreign intervention in its own affairs. China fears, for example, the possibility of calls for international intervention in response to future Chinese efforts to unite forcibly with Taiwan, or over China's treatment of its Tibetan and Uighur ethnic minority populations. The most notable occasion on which China strayed from the principle of non-interference was in March 2011, when China joined Russia in abstaining on a U.N. resolution authorizing military action against the Gaddafi regime in Libya, allowing the resolution to pass. Despite its abstention, just three days after the vote, Beijing criticized publicly military action authorized by the resolution. Many in China now see the Libya resolution as having been \"abused by the U.S. and NATO to pursue regime change.\" China's Syria policy also appears to be influenced by China's close relationship with Russia, with which it often coordinates on foreign policy. Unlike Russia, however, China has limited economic interests in Syria and, according to the Chinese government, only \"20-plus\" citizens in the country.  China says it has not taken sides in the Syrian civil war. According to China's Foreign Ministry, \"China has no selfish interests on the Syrian issue and has no intention to protect any party.\" China has in the past hosted visits from both Syrian government envoys and representatives of an opposition group, the Syrian National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change. A six-person delegation from another Syrian opposition group, the Syrian National Dialogue Forum, arrived in Beijing on September 10, 2013. Iran87 The Syrian regime's apparent chemical attack has created a major dilemma for Iran. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, Syria has been Iran's closest Arab ally, and, as discussed below, Iran has provided substantial resources to help the Asad regime combat the armed rebellion. Yet, perhaps in an effort to compel Iran to distance itself from the Asad regime, the international community has pointed out that Iran has long stressed that it is the foremost victim of chemical weapons use at the hands of Saddam Hussein's regime during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. United Nations investigations confirmed Iraqi chemical weapons against Iranian forces during that war, although it found that Iran has conducted some chemical attacks as well. Iran is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  What are Iran's interests in Syria? Syria under the Asad regime is a linchpin of Iranian strategy in the region\u2014Iran takes advantage of Syria's geographical location and prominence in the Arab world to pressure Israel, the United States, and Sunni Arab states allied with the United States. The Asad regime and Iran are linked by similar sectarian identities that distinguish them from Sunni Muslims: the Asads come from the Alawite community whose religious beliefs are distantly derived from Shiism, which is the overwhelmingly dominant sect in Iran. Along with geopolitical and other factors, this bond helped Iran and Syria transcend the Arab-Persian differences that would tend to divide them, as well as the contrasts between the Islamist nature of Iran's regime and Asad's secular rule. The regime of Bashar al Asad's father, Hafez al Asad, provided support to Iran during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, even though Iraq and Syria are both Arab states and were led by leaders from the Baathist movement.  Syria's value to Iran increased in the early to mid-1980s, when Lebanese Shiite clerics of the pro-Iranian Lebanese Da'wa Party began to organize in 1982 into what later was unveiled in 1985 as Hezbollah. Hezbollah identified itself as a \"resistance\" movement to Israel. Under the Asads, Syria has been the main transit point for Iranian weapons shipments to Hezbollah. Both Iran and Syria have viewed Hezbollah as leverage against Israel to try to achieve their regional and territorial aims.  Syria has also been a base for some Iran-supported Palestinian militant groups that the United States has accused of committing acts of terrorism in attempts to undermine Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts and Israel's overall security. The State Department report on terrorism for 2012, released May 30, 2013, repeated previous years' reports' assertions that Iran provides funding, weapons, and training to Hamas, Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). However, Hamas and PIJ are Sunni Muslim movements, and Hamas, in particular, has sought to distance itself from the Asad regime and\u2014to some extent\u2014Iran.  How is Iran supporting Asad? To try to prevent Asad's downfall, Iran is supporting the Syrian regime, including with funds, weapons, and fighters. Iran says it bases that aid on a long-standing defense relationship with Syria. Iran reportedly has provided the Asad regime military advisers and personnel, including members of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), the unit of the IRGC that supports pro-Iranian movements abroad, as well as an unknown number of IRGC-Ground Forces (IRGC-GF). The IRGC-GF has not previously deployed outside Iran, and its apparent deployment in Syria suggests that Iran is sparing no effort to try to keep Asad in power.  Iran has also helped in the recruitment of irregular forces and external pro-Asad groups. Iran reportedly has helped Syria set up its own popular militia forces to relieve some of the burden on the manpower-strapped Syrian army. Iran also was reportedly instrumental in persuading Hezbollah to become directly involved in the conflict and in the deployment of Iraqi Shiite militias that have come to Syria to help Asad.  There is little dispute among experts and officials that Iran also is sending substantial quantities of arms to the Asad regime. It is not known from open sources the approximate dollar value of the Iranian arms deliveries, or the exact types or quantities of arms being shipped. It has not been reported that Iran has delivered any heavy weapons to Syria such as tanks or armored personnel carriers\u2014such weapons are not especially plentiful in Iran's own arsenal. Delivery of heavy arms to Syria appears to be beyond Iran's airlift capabilities. Since the start of 2013, Iran reportedly has increased the frequency of its resupply flights to Syria to at least one per day. The flights typically overfly Iraq en route to Syria, and U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have\u2014apparently without consistent success\u2014urged Iraqi officials to interdict the flights and inspect them for arms deliveries.  Iran has also provided non-military forms of support to Asad, largely to counter threats to the regime from civil unrest and economic distress. As early in the uprising as April 14, 2011, and on several occasions since, U.S. officials have said that Iran is providing Syria with equipment to suppress crowds and to monitor and block use of the Internet. Particularly during the early periods of the Syria uprising, Iran advised the Asad regime on how to use such equipment to track down dissenters. Iran also has provided funds to try to stabilize the Syrian economy. In May 2013, Iran extended a $4 billion line of credit to the Asad regime, and is considering additional credits.  How might a U.S. Strike affect Iran? How might Iran respond? Several major questions arise with respect to Iran and U.S. policy toward Iran, should the United States strike Iran's ally Syria. One major issue is whether Iran might conduct military attacks against Israel, U.S. forces in the region, or U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf. According to official U.S. reports and assessments, Iran has the conventional weapons and missile arsenal to strike such targets, were there a decision to do so.  Most experts believe that direct Iranian retaliation is unlikely. Iran's Supreme Leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, has said that a U.S. attack on Syria would be a \"disaster for the region.\" There have been similar statements from other senior Iranian leaders but these leaders have not threatened that Iran itself would conduct any retaliation. There are no indications that Iran is positioning forces in the region to prepare for any retaliation. Iran also has a new president, Hassan Rouhani, a mid-ranking cleric, who has pledged to ease tensions with the international community\u2014a goal that would most likely be significantly set back were Iran to retaliate for any U.S. strike on Syria.  However, sources purportedly close to Iran's ally, Hezbollah (cited elsewhere in this report) have indicated that it might retaliate against Israel under certain circumstances. Additionally, Iran and Hezbollah have agents and cells in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere that could conduct future acts of terrorism as a response to a U.S. attack on Syria. Such actions might have an element of deniability that Iran perceives could prevent any immediate U.S. retaliation.  Some experts believe that a U.S. strike on Syria might not cause Iranian retaliation, but could cause Iran to break off talks with the international community over its nuclear program. Talks have been conducted, without firm conclusions, since 2003, but international negotiators have become more optimistic for the prospects of the talks since Rouhani assumed Iran's presidency on August 4, 2013. Iran has not, to date, threatened to boycott a new round of talks if and when a date for them is set.  Others argue that a U.S. refusal to respond militarily to Asad's apparent use of chemical weapons could affect Iran's nuclear calculations. According to this argument, Iran might interpret a U.S. failure to act militarily as an indication that the Obama Administration might not enforce its stated policy of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, if Iran were to undertake an effort to produce a nuclear weapon.  European and NATO Perspectives95 The 28 member states of the European Union (EU) have said that there is strong evidence that the Asad regime is responsible for a chemical attack on August 21 and have called for a \"clear and strong\" international response. There is disagreement, however, on what form such a response should take, and widespread skepticism and reluctance on the question of possible offensive military action. Collective military operations against the Asad government through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the EU therefore do not appear to be a possibility. European leaders have also emphasized the importance of working through the U.N., saying on September 7 that any further action against the Asad regime should not come before an expected preliminary U.N. report on the alleged chemical weapons attack.  According to the State Department, as of September 5, the following European countries had \"publicly and explicitly expressed support for U.S. military action,\" against Asad: Albania, Kosovo, Denmark, France, Poland, Romania, and Turkey. France appears to be the only European country considering participating in such military action, however, and has said it would not act alone. United Kingdom The UK government has been leading international pressure against the Asad regime in Syria. Alongside France, the UK has pushed for United Nations action, has been a leading voice in passing EU sanctions against the Asad regime, and successfully argued for lifting the EU arms embargo in order to assist opposition forces. Although it has not openly delivered weapons to the opposition, the UK has reportedly provided non-lethal equipment, humanitarian assistance, and some training. Following the report of chemical weapons attacks by Syrian forces on August 21, the UK's National Security Council \"decided unanimously that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime is unacceptable and that the world can not stand by in the face of that.\" The government's campaign to build a case for military action abruptly deflated, however, when the House of Commons voted on August 29 against UK participation in any prospective strikes on the Asad regime, and Prime Minister Cameron subsequently ruled it out. Prime Minister Cameron has since refuted suggestions that the government might go back to Parliament for a second vote on the use of force if circumstances in Syria change significantly, or following a vote by the U.S. Congress. Speculation about a potential second vote nevertheless continues, but as of early September, UK involvement is expected to consist primarily of intelligence support, diplomatic pressure, and increased humanitarian aid.  France100  Along with the UK, the French government has been leading international efforts to pressure the Asad regime. France was the first country to recognize the Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people.\" Officials in Paris have said there is \"no doubt\" that Asad has used chemical weapons and have said that they favor military strikes against Asad in response. France reportedly has deployed an anti-aircraft frigate and other military assets off the Syrian coast in anticipation of such an operation. Officials in Paris have indicated, however, that French military action would come only in support of a U.S.-led operation. Since President Obama's announcement that he would seek congressional approval for U.S. military action, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has faced growing public pressure to follow suit. The French parliament debated the merits of a possible intervention in early September, but has not held a vote on the issue and parliamentary approval for such action is not required. Nonetheless, in the view of some commentators, Hollande could become increasingly sensitive to public opposition to possible military intervention\u2014some opinion polls indicate that more than two-thirds of respondents in France are opposed. In what was perceived as an effort to build public and international support, on September 6, Hollande said he would not authorize military action before the release of an anticipated U.N. report on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. On September 10, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced France's intention to present a U.N. Security Council Resolution that would call on the Asad government to dismantle its chemical weapons program. Fabius said the resolution would be proposed under the auspices of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which would allow member states to use all possible means, including military action, to enforce it. Among other things, the resolution would (1) condemn the August 21 chemical weapons attack and punish the perpetrators of the attack in the international justice system; (2) demand that the Asad government's chemical weapons program be placed under international control and be dismantled, with mechanisms for inspection and monitoring; and (3) provide for \"extremely serious\" consequences of Syrian violation of its obligations under this agreement. French officials reportedly have said they are willing to amend their resolution in response to Russian concerns. Germany104 The German government has strongly condemned the Asad regime, calling its alleged use of chemical weapons a \"horrific crime against humanity ... that cannot go unpunished.\" Berlin is reportedly reluctant, however, to endorse a military response that is not authorized by the U.N. Security Council. Germany is also considered unlikely to participate in any military operation in Syria, even if under a U.N. or NATO mandate. Analysts note that the German government could be particularly sensitive to public opposition to potential offensive military action ahead of a federal election scheduled for September 22. The German government reportedly has agreed to allow 5,000 Syrian refugees to resettle in Germany by the end of the year. NATO What is NATO's role? At the request of NATO member state Turkey, since the beginning of 2013, NATO has carried out an air defense mission along Turkey's southeastern border with Syria, \"to augment Turkey's air defence capabilities in order to defend the population and territory of Turkey and contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along the Alliance's border.\" NATO officials have emphasized that the deployment of six Patriot missile batteries \"is defensive only. It will in no way support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation.\" The United States, Germany, and the Netherlands are each operating two Patriot batteries, deployed to military bases near the population centers of Gaziantep, Karamanmaras, and Adana, respectively.  Some Members of Congress, as well as Air Force General Philip Breedlove, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and Commander of U.S. European Command (in his Senate confirmation hearing), have suggested that the Patriot batteries currently under NATO command could be used to support offensive military operations against Asad, including the possible establishment of a no-fly zone or a \"humanitarian corridor\" to protect civilians. Although the allies have uniformly condemned the Asad regime, NATO has not considered establishment of a no-fly zone and key allied officials have reiterated that the Patriot deployment is defensive only. Speaking on behalf of the allies on August 28, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the use of chemical weapons, \"a clear breach of long-standing international norms and practice ... that cannot go unanswered.\" However, there does not appear to be a consensus within the alliance on endorsing possible NATO-led offensive military operations against the Asad regime. Any NATO operation would require the unanimous backing of the member states, though not all would be obliged to participate.  European Union What is the European Union's role? The EU has been a leading voice alongside the United States in international condemnation of the Asad regime and its actions in Syria's armed conflict. With a stronger U.N. response blocked by Russia and China in the Security Council, the EU has moved ahead on the basis of unanimous agreement among its member states to impose extensive sanctions designed to put pressure on the regime. Like the United States, in December 2012 the EU recognized the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. After a British and French push to lift the EU arms embargo on Syria in order to arm opposition forces, the embargo was allowed to expire in May 2013 despite strong objections from a number of other EU countries. As a result, arms exports to the opposition could be authorized on a national, case-by-case basis, with safeguards intended to prevent misuse, although the EU member states agreed to refrain from such deliveries pending a review of the situation. Similar to NATO, there is no consensus among EU member states for military operations. In any case, analysts have had no expectations that any such operations would be conducted under an EU flag. At the G20 Summit held in St. Petersburg on September 5-6, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy reportedly stated that there is no military solution to the Syria conflict. Despite efforts led by France to gain backing for potential military action, this viewpoint was subsequently conveyed as the agreed position of the 28 member states by High Representative Catherine Ashton in a statement following an EU foreign ministers meeting on September 7.  Turkey Since late 2011, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been an active opponent of the Asad regime and has outspokenly advocated for U.N.-backed intervention. It has hosted Syrian refugees and opposition figures and\u2014reportedly\u2014helped funnel assistance to armed Syrian rebel groups. Following the apparent August 21 chemical weapons attack, Erdogan has indicated that Turkey would \"take part\" in any international coalition against Syria. On August 30, Erdogan was quoted as saying that any strike on Syria should not be a \"24 hours hit-and-run. What matters is stopping the bloodshed in Syria and weakening the regime to the point where it gives up.\" Notwithstanding Erdogan's stated preference for a broader military response than what U.S. officials appear to be contemplating, the nature and scope of potential Turkish involvement is unclear. Turkey maintains one of NATO's largest militaries, but political sensitivities and potential vulnerabilities vis-\u00e0-vis bordering countries and Kurdish communities in the region could constrain its direct participation in military operations. Asked what Turkey's role might be, as reports on September 8 indicated that it was bolstering its border defenses, Erdogan was quoted as saying, \"Whether it would be as an opposing force or supplying forces to provide logistical support, all this would be determined by circumstances.\" Turkey hosts U.S. and NATO military assets in various locations throughout the country, which could be among the targets of potential Syrian or Syrian-allied retaliation for a U.S.-led attack. Members of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), though condemning the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria, have warned of the risks of military intervention and insisted that Turkish law requires parliamentary approval of any use of Turkish territory by foreign troops to attack Syria. The Turkish parliament voted in 2003 against allowing the United States to invade Iraq from its Turkish border. Arab States117 Arab countries have staked differing positions on the Syrian civil war and have backed different rebel/political groups, perpetuating the divisiveness and disorganization of the armed and unarmed Syrian opposition. Until recently, Qatar had aggressively backed the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood in exile as well as various Islamist-oriented armed groups on the ground. There are some indications that the recent leadership transition in Qatar may result in a recalibration of Doha's former embrace of Islamist activists. Saudi Arabia, which also has backed its own militias, has been less supportive of more radical elements in the Syrian political and armed opposition. Private entities in the Arab Gulf states continue to provide material and political support to extremist groups operating in Syria. Egypt, where the military has returned to power after ousting a president who had hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood, may be even less inclined than Saudi Arabia to support Sunni Islamist Syrian rebels, though it has been preoccupied with internal issues throughout the war's duration.  What is the position of the Arab League? Publicly, many Arab states are hesitant to endorse a possible Western military intervention in Syria. Nevertheless, on August 27, the Arab League, which had already suspended Syria from its membership back in 2011, issued a joint statement on the apparent August 21 chemical weapons attack, stating that it held \"the Syrian regime responsible for this heinous crime.\" The statement also called on the United Nations Security Council to \"overcome the disagreements between its members'' [so it could] ''take the necessary deterring measures against the perpetrators of this crime.\" The Arab League has modified its original position insisting on U.N. Security Council action to call for the Security Council and the international community to \"take the deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime for which the Syrian regime bears responsibility.\" Israel and Its Concern for Potential Retaliation118 An important U.S. concern regarding possible military action against Syria is potential retaliation by Syria and its allies\u2014especially Iran and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, but also possibly Gaza-based militants such as Palestine Islamic Jihad \u2014against Israel. Possible threats of retaliation against other U.S. regional allies (including Turkey, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states) are linked to these countries' involvement in aiding the Syrian opposition and potentially serving as bases for U.S.-led military operations. Even though Israel has reportedly carried out limited strikes in Syria this year to prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, retaliatory threats against it appear to stem less from its recent involvement in the conflict than from historical and geopolitical animosities and probable desires among Syria and its allies to deter the United States from acting militarily\u2014given long-standing U.S. interests in Israel's security.  At least since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, U.S. regional military planning has taken into account the possibility of attacks on Israel and the potential for any Israeli response to trigger wider regional war. In the present case, U.S. consideration of this factor is seemingly being weighed alongside concerns about possible consequences for Israel (in connection with overarching questions about defense of U.S. allies and U.S. credibility) if either the United States does not respond to the Asad regime's apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria, or any response it makes is ineffective. In September 3 hearing testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the possible use of U.S. military force in Syria, Secretary Kerry said: I can make it crystal clear to you that Israel will be less safe unless the United States takes this action. Iran and Hezbollah are two of the three biggest allies of Assad. And Iran and Hezbollah are the two single biggest enemies of Israel. So, if\u2014Iran and Hezbollah are advantaged by the United States not curbing Assad's use of chemical weapons, there is a much greater likelihood that at some point down the road, Hezbollah, who has been one of the principal reasons for a change in the situation on the ground, will have access to these weapons of mass destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said, \"Now the whole world is watching. Iran is watching and it wants to see what would be the reaction on the use of chemical weapons.\" Yet, some accounts indicate that Israeli officials \"have little desire to see [Asad] toppled,\" given what may follow, and are \"wary of creating any perception that they are meddling in either American politics or the civil war in neighboring Syria.\"  American Jewish and self-described \"pro-Israel\" organizations are participating in the public discourse on the question of U.S. intervention. According to a Washington Post article, \"groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations called for bipartisan consensus [on September 3] around the use of force.\" J Street, another organization, issued an August 29 statement on its website that read, \"As President Obama and world leaders contemplate the appropriate course of action, we are cognizant that there are no easy or clear-cut solutions.\" What threats exist from Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Gaza-based militants regarding potential retaliation against Israel in the event of a U.S.-led strike on Syria? Syrian and Iranian officials have made statements indicating that Israel would be a target of retaliation in the event of a U.S.-led attack on Syria. General Mohammad Ali Jafari, chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was quoted as saying that an attack on Syria \"means the immediate destruction of Israel.\" In an August 28 Lebanese news report, a source supposedly close to Hezbollah was cited as saying that Hezbollah would probably not retaliate against Israel in the event of a limited U.S.-led strike, but would likely retaliate in the event of a \"large-scale Western strike\" that aims to \"change the balance of power in Syria.\" A source that supposedly liaises between Hezbollah and the Syrian military was cited as saying that a potential Hezbollah retaliation against Israel for a U.S. strike would take place from the Syrian city of Homs to \"keep Lebanon out of the war.\" An Israeli military spokesman has publicly stated that although Israel is preparing for the contingency of Syrian or Syrian-allied retaliation against Israel in response to a U.S.-led strike, the probability of retaliation is low. Israeli calculations that retaliation is possible but unlikely probably owe to a presumption that Israel's adversaries do not want to risk escalating and expanding the conflict beyond its current level and scope. What damage could retaliatory rocket or missile strikes do to Israel, and how prepared is Israel to defend itself? If one or more of them chose to retaliate, Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Gaza-based militants could threaten Israeli territory\u2014as indicated by the range maps (see below)\u2014with thousands of rockets and missiles of varying ranges, accuracies, and payloads (i.e., high-explosives or possible chemical warheads in the case of Syrian SCUDs). In addition to insisting that it would respond forcefully to any attack on its territory, and calling up reserve military units, Israel maintains multiple anti-rocket and anti-missile platforms largely through U.S. assistance and/or co-production: Iron Dome, Patriot, and Arrow II. Israel claims substantial success with Iron Dome in countering rockets with ranges under about 75 km. The Patriot and Arrow II systems are designed to intercept Syrian SCUD missiles (ranges of 300-500 km). Iranian SCUDs are not capable of reaching Israel. It is unclear whether\u2014and perhaps unlikely that\u2014Patriot or Arrow II systems are capable of intercepting very short-range Hezbollah tactical missiles that could reach central and southern Israel. Reports indicate that transportable Iron Dome batteries have been deployed to various locations throughout the country, including Jerusalem. Although the U.S.-Israel cooperative platform David's Sling has supposedly been tested successfully against short-range tactical missiles (40-300 km), this system is not expected to be operational until about 2014. It is possible that some David's Sling units may have been deployed recently, but its availability to counter missiles from Hezbollah is unknown. There are no systems currently deployed in Israel that are designed to intercept Iranian medium-range ballistic missiles (1,500-2,000 km). The Arrow III, which is designed to counter such missiles, had a successful test launch in 2013, but is not expected to be operational until about 2014-2015.  Israel is preparing additional measures on the home front to absorb a possible retaliatory strike. In previous instances\u20141991 during the Gulf War, 2006 against Hezbollah, and on two occasions (2008-2009 and November 2012) against Hamas and other Palestinian militants\u2014many Israelis took cover in bomb shelters and in safe rooms that are now routinely built into their residences. According to reports, approximately 50 Israeli civilians were directly killed by missile and rocket strikes during these three conflicts combined. There are concerns, however, that the more advanced missiles likely to be used in any retaliation from Iran, Syria, or Hezbollah could produce casualties and damage of a higher magnitude. In addition, a significant portion of the population may not have ready access to bomb shelters, and logistical complications and expense could delay full distribution of gas masks, which large numbers of Israelis are seeking in the event of a chemical weapons attack. Outlook Intense current speculation centers around the potential for punitive U.S.-led military strike on Syrian government forces and the Russian government's proposed disarmament plan for Syria. Action on either of these initiatives would have major implications for the ongoing conflict in Syria and the international crisis the conflict has created. Given stated U.S. objectives and fears of a deeper power vacuum in Syria, it appears unlikely that any U.S. actions in the immediate future would attempt to eliminate the Asad regime entirely. President Obama has said \"I have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria,\" and, at present, U.S. officials hope to achieve a negotiated political settlement to establish a new government that can keep the Syrian state intact, secure its chemical weapon stockpiles, secure its borders, and prevent or combat terrorism.  The importance of the war in Syria for broader U.S. national security policy objectives may be linked more to its consequences for regional and global stability than to the details and outcome of the Syrian conflict itself. The civil war has sharpened divisions between the United States and some members of the European Union on the one hand and Russia and China on the other over competing concepts of how the international community should enforce peace and security and defend international norms. In the wake of the Libya conflict, the latter countries have continually opposed U.S. and European efforts to use the United Nations Security Council to endorse the protection of civilians in Syria. It remains to be seen whether the members of the Security Council will find a mutually acceptable formula for implementing the proposed disarmament initiative. The war also has raised concern that transnational terrorist groups modeled on Al Qaeda in Afghanistan-Pakistan may be resurgent in Syria and may gain access to advanced conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons against its opponents and civilians is not only a serious development in the Syrian conflict but a potential precedent for other countries with possible chemical, biological, or nuclear programs. How the United States and others respond in the days and weeks ahead will most likely be watched closely in countries concerned with the potential for confrontation over similar programs in Iran and North Korea. The war in Syria also has been a major dividing line within the United States over competing visions of U.S. foreign policy. Some commentators continue to assert that the American public is \"war-weary,\" and that military intervention is inadvisable when public backing for expending \"blood and treasure\" on an operation of any duration and scope is uncertain. Others suggest that U.S. global leadership is needed more than ever to steer the country and its people away from what some see as isolationist tendencies.  Appendix. Analysis of Proposed Authorizations for the Use of Military Force as of September 6, 2013 The following analysis is based on the following texts available as of September 6, 2013: Administration Draft Proposal: CNN, Text of draft legislation submitted by Obama to Congress, August 31, 2013. S.J.Res. 21 : Available online from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S.%20J.%20Res.%2021.pdf Draft Proposal from Representatives Van Hollen and Connolly: Available at: http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/165278488-House-Van-Hollen-Connolly-Syria-Resolution.pdf \n",

      "Update as of September 12, 2013 The Syrian government's apparent acceptance of a Russian proposal for Syria to acknowledge its chemical weapons and place them under international control has recast the ongoing debates over how to respond to an August 21 chemical weapons attack and bring an end to the Syrian civil war. Other parties including Senator Richard Lugar had proposed a U.S.-Russian-facilitated disarmament initiative prior to the announcement. On September 10, Syrian officials signaled their willingness \"to disclose the locations of chemical weapons, to stop producing them, and to reveal these locations to representatives of Russia, other states, and the United Nations\"",
      " with the goal of \"ending our possession of all chemical weapons.\" On September 12, in an interview on Russian television, President Asad reportedly said that \"Syria is placing its chemical weapons under international control because of Russia. The U.S. threats did not influence the decision.\" President Asad also stated that his government will be sending documents \"in the next few days\" to the United Nations for joining the international convention that bans the use of chemical munitions. Speaking in a national address on September 10, President Barack Obama said:... over the last few days, we've seen some encouraging signs, in part because of the credible threat of U.S.",
      " military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin. The Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons. The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons and even said they'd join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use. It's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments, but this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assad's strongest allies. I have therefore asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.",
      " I'm sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin. I've spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies -- France and the United Kingdom -- and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons and to ultimately destroy them under international control. President Obama and senior members of his Administration continue to seek authorization from Congress for a limited use of military force against the Asad regime while exploring the potential for the establishment of international control over Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles and related elements of its chemical weapons program.",
      "  The governments of China, the United Kingdom, and France have responded favorably to the proposal, and, as of September 11, Russia had rejected a French plan for a binding United Nations Security Council resolution that could be enforced with military action. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov are scheduled to meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on September 12 to discuss the proposal further. Some Syrian rebel leaders have rejected the proposal and characterized it as a delaying tactic while maintaining their calls for international assistance and punishment of the Syrian government.  Overview and Summary of Recent Developments On August 30, the Obama Administration presented intelligence analysis stating with \"high confidence\"",
      " that the Syrian government was responsible for an August 21 chemical weapons attack against civilians in rebel-held areas of the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government continues to categorically deny any responsibility for any chemical weapons attack.  President Obama called the Syrian government's reported use of chemical weapons \"an assault on human dignity\"\u00a0that \"presents a serious danger to our national security.\" He further requested that Congress authorize the use of force for military operations \"against Syrian regime targets\" to \"hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out.\" According to the President, such military operations would be \"limited in duration and scope\"",
      " and \"would not put boots on the ground.\"  In the wake of the Russian disarmament proposal, President Obama requested that lawmakers pause in their formal consideration of proposed legislation to authorize the use of force in Syria. Nevertheless, debate continues among Members of Congress about the pros and cons of proposed authorization approaches as well as the disarmament proposal now under discussion. President Obama has stated his view that \"the credible threat of U.S. military action\" contributed to the emergence of the disarmament initiative, and has underscored that he has \"ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.\" A draft resolution authorizing the use of force submitted to Congress by the White House would authorize the President:",
      " to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria in order to \u2013 (1) prevent or deter the use or proliferation (including the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors), within, to or from Syria, of any weapons of mass destruction, including chemical or biological weapons or components of or materials used in such weapons; or (2) protect the United States and its allies and partners against the threat posed by such weapons. Lawmakers in the Senate and House are considering alternative authorization proposals, amid concerns that the Administration's proposed text may not sufficiently limit the scope or duration of any potential military response.",
      " Others reportedly are drafting proposals that would reflect the disarmament proposal under consideration and could seek to make an authorization for the use of U.S. military force contingent on the satisfaction of criteria related to the enforcement of a disarmament agreement.  On September 4, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee debated and adopted an alternative resolution authorizing the use of military force for specific purposes, including to deter further use of chemical weapons and to prevent the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors within Syria of any weapons of mass destruction. The provision would limit the deployment of U.S. forces on the ground for \"combat operations\" but may not constrain the deployment of U.S.",
      " forces in Syria for other purposes. As of September 11, the House had not formally considered an alternative authorization proposal, although some Members had circulated draft proposals or introduced measures that would restrict the availability of funds for U.S. military operations or support for opposition groups in Syria.  In Syria, the brutal civil war continues, even as Syrian government forces were reported to be taking measures to prepare for potential U.S.-led military operations against them. President Bashar al Asad has stated that the United States and others accusing it of carrying out chemical weapons strikes have not presented any evidence to support their allegations, and he has warned that external military intervention in Syria's civil war risks igniting a regional conflict.",
      " U.S. military officials have confirmed that the Syrian government has taken steps to prepare for potential attacks, but as of September 10, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey testified that \"The indications are, today, that [Syria's chemical weapons capability] does remain under the firm control of the regime.\" Syrian officials have requested that the United Nations Security Council act to prevent aggression against Syria.  Iran's Supreme Leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamene'i, has said that a U.S. attack on Syria would be a \"disaster for the region.\" There have been similar statements from other senior Iranian leaders,",
      " but these leaders have not threatened that Iran itself would conduct any retaliation. Iranian Revolutionary Guard Commander Major General Mohammed Ali Jafari has stated that, \"The U.S. imagination about limited military intervention in Syria is merely an illusion, as reactions will be coming from beyond Syria's borders.\" Russian and Chinese officials remain opposed to the U.S. proposal for punitive military strikes, while the Arab League has modified its original position insisting on United Nations Security Council action to call for the Security Council and the international community to \"take the deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime for which the Syrian regime bears responsibility.\" The Arab League has welcomed the Russian disarmament proposal,",
      " but Arab League Secretary General Nabil al Arabi has emphasized that the group remains focused on punishment for the August 21 incident and international action to bring an end to the civil war.  United Kingdom leaders stated prior to the Russian proposal that they have no intention of seeking new authorization from Parliament to participate in any international military operation following Parliament's rejection of a measure to do so. French government officials have proposed measures to implement the Russian proposal and presented supporting intelligence on September 2 to French legislators concerning what they describe as \"the massive use of chemical agents\" by Syrian government forces. U.S. military assets remain in place in the vicinity of Syria.",
      " As of September 2, five guided missile destroyers were reported to be deployed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea: the USS Stout, USS Gravely, USS Mahan, USS Barry, and USS Ramage. The USS San Antonio, carrying forces from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, and unspecified attack submarines also were reported to be nearby. The USS Kearsarge and the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group were reported to be deploying westward toward the Red Sea. In announcing his decision that punitive military action was required on August 31, President Obama stated, \"I'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that,",
      " so far, has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Asad accountable.\" President Obama also said, \"I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization.\" Assessment The war in Syria and the debate over possible punitive U.S. military action against the Asad regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons pose a uniquely challenging series of questions for policy makers. The overarching questions remain how to define, prioritize, and secure the core interests of the United States with regard to Syria's complex civil war. The immediate questions are whether and how best to respond to the apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria and how such a response might affect U.S.",
      " interests and standing regionally and globally. In weighing these questions, many Members of Congress and Administration officials are seeking both to protect concrete U.S. national security interests and to preserve abstract international security principles that may serve those interests.  A mass casualty chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21 was the latest and most deadly of a string of reported instances where Syrian forces allegedly have used chemical weapons despite President Obama's prior statement that the transfer or use of chemical weapons is \"a red line\" that would \"change his calculus.\" The President and senior members of his Administration have argued that the United States has a national security interest in ensuring that \"when countries break international norms on chemical weapons they are held accountable.\" Administration officials and some observers believe that by failing to respond after setting out a so-called \"red line,\" the United States would risk not only undermining any international norms against the use of such weapons but would risk undermining its own credibility.",
      "  By his own account, President Obama believes that extensive, sustained U.S. military intervention to shape the outcome of Syria's civil conflict is undesirable. Instead, the Obama Administration has worked with Congress to increase U.S. assistance to non-radical elements of the opposition. In response to previous instances of alleged chemical weapons use, the Administration reportedly notified Congress in July 2012 of its intent to begin covert U.S. arming of select groups. On August 31, the President stated his conclusion that the United States should respond to alleged Syrian chemical weapons use with limited militarily strikes.  Administration officials have cited a number of reasons for their skepticism of direct military involvement to shift the balance of power in the underlying conflict,",
      " including fears of exacerbating the violence; inviting greater regional spillover or intervention; or opening a power vacuum that could benefit extremists. Other foreign policy priorities also have influenced the Administration's position, such as a desire to maintain limited international consensus on Iran's nuclear program and concern that sectarian and strategic competition in Syria could ignite a regional conflict and threaten U.S. allies and security interests. While condemning Asad as a thug and a murderer and aiding some of his adversaries, U.S. officials have continued to stress the need for a negotiated political solution to the conflict in the hopes of keeping the Syrian state intact, securing its chemical weapon stockpiles and borders,",
      " and combating extremist groups now active there.  Some critics have argued that the potential risks that even a limited military response could pose to these objectives outweigh the potential benefits to the United States of reasserting an international standard or being seen to have reliably followed through on a commitment to act. These arguments suggest that if a military strike makes the political solution desired by U.S. officials less likely, then the destabilizing conflict could continue or worsen. Similarly, this line of argument suggests that if military operations were to dramatically degrade remaining state authority\u2014whether intentionally or unintentionally\u2014then undesired outcomes with regard to terrorism, proliferation, or mass atrocities could occur.",
      " Still other critics of the Administration, including some Members of Congress, charge that U.S. hesitation to intervene militarily to protect Syrian civilians and/or help oust the Asad government has unnecessarily prolonged the fighting. Over time, these critics argue, the costs of inaction have grown intolerably as the humanitarian situation has deteriorated, violent extremist groups have seized the initiative, and Syria's neighbors, including several U.S. partners, have been overwhelmed by refugees and threatened with violence. Others have argued that by failing to halt the fighting in Syria, the United States and others are exacerbating already volatile Sunni-Shiite sectarian tensions throughout Middle East,",
      " thus posing risks to other strategically important countries. Finally, some critics argue that U.S. global credibility is being diminished by Asad's reluctance to step down or end abuses of civilians despite U.S. demands. The Russian disarmament proposal and Syria's reported acceptance of its basic terms have introduced even further complication to these debates. At present debate centers on the parameters of the proposal, the feasibility of implementation, the risks and rewards it poses relative to U.S. regional security and nonproliferation goals, and its implications for U.S. international leadership. Syrian opposition leaders' rejection of the proposal and their calls for punitive action and assistance in their struggle against the Asad regime may complicate U.S.",
      " relations with opposition groups moving forward. Reconciling immediate U.S. goals with regard to the August 21 incident, medium-term U.S. goals with regard to the conflict and Syria, and overarching goals related to weapons of mass destruction may prove challenging. Sorting through these competing perspectives and prescriptions now falls to Members of Congress as they consider the President's proposed course of action, his request that Congress authorize the use of force, the feasibility of international disarmament proposals for Syria, and the future of U.S. policy with regard to the conflict in Syria and its regional consequences. Summary of U.S. Intelligence on August 21 Incident  An unclassified summary of the U.S.",
      " intelligence community's assessment released by the White House concludes, among other things, that:  The United States Government assesses with high confidence that the Syrian government carried out a chemical weapons attack in the Damascus suburbs on August 21, 2013. A preliminary U.S. government assessment determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children. The U.S. intelligence community has intelligence that leads it to assess that Syrian chemical weapons personnel\u2014including personnel assessed to be associated with the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC), the entity responsible for Syria's chemical weapons program\u2014were preparing chemical munitions prior to the attack.",
      " The U.S. intelligence community assesses that the opposition has not used chemical weapons and the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on August 21 is highly unlikely. Satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime-controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred\u2014including Kafr Batna, Jawbar, 'Ayn Tarma, Darayya, and Mu'addamiyah (see Figure 1 above). On September 1, Secretary of State John Kerry further stated that tests of blood and hair samples from Syrian first responders obtained by the United States indicated exposure to the nerve agent sarin.  United Nations weapons inspectors have departed Syria,",
      " and U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-moon has requested that the team \"expedite the mission's analysis of the samples and information it had obtained without jeopardizing the scientific timelines required for accurate analysis, and to report the results to him as soon as possible.\" Conflict Update  The August 21 incident occurred as the popular-uprising-turned-armed-rebellion in Syria is in its third year and has devolved into a bloody struggle of attrition between the government and a diverse array of opposition militias. Over the course of Syria's civil war, momentum has shifted between government and rebel forces. Support provided by Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters appears to have helped the Asad regime wrest the initiative from the opposition near the city of Homs and to launch counteroffensives on the outskirts of the capital.",
      " The August 21 attack appears to have been part of a fierce and ongoing Syrian military bombardment of rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus.  Various opposition forces control areas of northwestern, eastern, and southern Syria (see Figure 2 below). In areas near the northern city of Aleppo, diverse rebel forces have announced limited tactical successes in recent weeks, including the fall of a key military air base. According to close observers of the conflict, some extremist militia groups are seeking to assert political and social control over some areas in which they operate, while they and others among the range of \"extraordinarily fractured\" militia groups continue to battle regime forces for contested areas.",
      " Reportedly, the Supreme Military Council (SMC), to which the United States has provided aid, \"is still far from a functioning rebel leadership.\" European press reporting contends that offensives by rebels in northern Syria and by foreign trained rebels in the vicinity of Damascus have caused serious alarm among regime leaders since mid-August. United Nations officials cite estimates that over 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict. As many as 4.25 million Syrians have been displaced inside the country and more than 2 million Syrian refugees are in neighboring countries. The Syrian conflict and the humanitarian crisis it has created have deepened the economic and political challenges facing the region and exacerbated sectarian tensions and violence,",
      " particularly in Iraq and Lebanon. To date, the United States has provided over $1 billion in humanitarian aid in Syria and neighboring countries, with U.N. appeals seeking over $4 billion in assistance. President Obama called for Syrian President Bashar al Asad's resignation in August 2011, but, as noted above, the Obama Administration has rejected calls for more direct U.S. intervention in Syria. Nevertheless, the intensifying regional costs of the Syrian crisis and reports of chemical weapons use by Syrian government forces have placed increasing pressure on the Obama Administration to respond. Secretary Kerry has signaled that the Administration may seek to further augment U.S. support to some opposition elements in parallel with any limited military operations focused on chemical weapons.",
      " In the 113 th Congress, some Members have introduced proposed legislation that would authorize expanded assistance to the opposition. H.R. 1327, the Free Syria Act of 2013, would, among other things, authorize the President, under certain conditions and with various reporting and certification requirements, to supply nonlethal and/or lethal support to Syrian opposition groups. S. 960, the Syria Transition Support Act of 2013, would, among other things, authorize the President, notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts assistance to Syria, to provide assistance, including defense articles, defense services, and training to vetted opposition forces.",
      " The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved S. 960 as amended by a 15-3 vote in May 2013. Proposed Authorizations for the Use of Military Force Current debate focuses on the possible ramifications of an authorization for the use of military force with regard to Syria. Key subjects of debate include the purposes of any such authorization; potential location and targets of military force; the type of force that may be employed, including whether or not U.S. ground forces are authorized; the potential duration of military operations; and the resources available for such operations. Historical Perspective Legal scholars have continually compared and contrasted congressional authorizations of the use of force over time,",
      " and generally categorize them in terms of their relative limits on or permissiveness of executive authority and action. According to one study: The primary differences between limited and broad authorizations are as follows: In limited authorizations, Congress restricts the resources and methods of force that the President can employ, sometimes expressly restricts targets, identifies relatively narrow purposes for the use of force, and sometimes imposes time limits or procedural restrictions. In broad authorizations, Congress imposes few if any limits on resources or methods, does not restrict targets other than to identify an enemy, invokes relatively broad purposes, and generally imposes few if any timing or procedural restrictions. Some argue,",
      " however, that provisions attempting to circumscribe the President's ability to conduct military operations improperly interfere with the President's commander-in-chief powers under Article II of the Constitution. Past cases suggest that limits on appropriations may provide the most direct and effective means of asserting congressional control over military operations. For CRS analysis of these questions, see \" War Powers \" below and CRS Report R41989, Congressional Authority to Limit Military Operations, by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RL31133, Declarations of War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force: Historical Background and Legal Implications,",
      " by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed]. Current Proposals and the Situation in Syria For a side-by-side comparison of three proposed resolutions to authorize the use of military force in Syria with commentary, see the Appendix. The following analysis is based on texts available as of September 6, 2013. As described above, a draft resolution authorizing the use of force submitted to Congress by the White House would authorize the President: to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria in order to \u2013 (1)",
      " prevent or deter the use or proliferation (including the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors), within, to or from Syria, of any weapons of mass destruction, including chemical or biological weapons or components of or materials used in such weapons; or (2) protect the United States and its allies and partners against the threat posed by such weapons. Alternate proposals are under consideration in both the Senate and House of Representatives. On September 4, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee debated and adopted, by a vote of 10-7 (with one \"present\") a resolution ( S.J.Res. 21 ) to authorize the President,",
      " subject to required certifications, to:  use the Armed Forces of the United States as the President determines to be necessary and appropriate in a limited and specified manner against legitimate military targets in Syria, only to\u2014 (1) respond to the use of weapons of mass destruction by the Government of Syria in the conflict in Syria;  (2) deter Syria's use of such weapons in order to protect the national security interests of the United States and to protect United States allies and partners against the use of such weapons;  (3) degrade Syria's capacity to use such weapons in the future; and  (4) prevent the transfer to terrorist groups or other state or non-state actors within Syria of any weapons of mass destruction.",
      " The Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposal states that it does not \"authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Syria for the purpose of combat operations.\" The resolution does not define \"combat operations.\" It remains unclear whether the resolution as reported by the committee would authorize members of the U.S. Armed Forces to operate on the ground in Syria in non-combatant (i.e., advisory, logistical, intelligence, or other enabling) roles to carry out the purposes specified in the resolution. As reported, the resolution includes a sunset clause of 60 days for the authorization, with provision for one 30-day extension. Representatives Chris Van Hollen and Gerald Connolly have circulated a draft authorization for the use of military force that would authorize the President \"to use the United States Armed Forces to prevent and deter the further use of chemical weapons in Syria or by Syria against any other group or country.\" The authorization would expire \"upon the conclusion of each military action conducted by the United States Armed Forces beginning after the initial military action conducted by the United States Armed Forces\"",
      " unless the President certifies to Congress in writing that the President finds \"with high confidence\" that Syria has used chemical weapons subsequent to the conclusion of \"the immediately preceding military action conducted by the United States Armed Forces.\" As of September 4, the draft proposal does not define \"military action.\" The authorization would expire completely after 60 days. With regard to Syria, matters for possible consideration may include whether or not allies of the Syrian government, such as Iran, Lebanese Hezbollah, or other non-state actors who may gain access to chemical or biological weapons or components, are intended as potential targets of U.S. military action and if so,",
      " what the implications of conflict with those actors might be. The costs and duration of any potential operation may be relevant, as well as the potential for retaliatory action by the Syrian government and its supporters that could threaten allies to whom the United States has made various security commitments, including Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.  Secretary of State Kerry also has discussed some hypothetical contingencies, including the prospect that U.S. forces may be required to act to secure Syria's stockpiles of chemical weapons. The Administration has not indicated in recent testimony whether such actions may require U.S. \"boots on the ground.\" In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he said,",
      "  in the event Syria imploded, for instance, or in the event there was a threat of a chemical weapons cache falling into the hands of al-Nusra or someone else, and it was clearly in the interests of our allies and all of us -- the British, the French and others -- to prevent those weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of the worst elements, I don't want to take off the table an option that might or might not be available to a president of the United States to secure our country. Congress also may wish to assess criteria for measuring the success of any specific planned action and how such action fits within broader U.S.",
      " regional and international policy goals; for example if limited strikes fail to deter or prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons in Syria, will the United States pursue continued or wider military action? Similarly, if the Syrian government refrains from further use of chemical weapons but continues indiscriminate attacks on rebel held areas using conventional weaponry, will a limited U.S. military action be deemed successful? What effect might strikes on Syrian military targets have on the current dynamics of the Syrian civil war and how might rebel groups, whether moderate or extremist, potentially exploit U.S. military action? Issues for Congress Chemical Weapons Issues18 On the night of August 21, an alleged chemical weapons attack killed hundreds in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Damascus.",
      " If confirmed, this would be the largest number of casualties from a chemical weapons attack in this conflict to date. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France have issued statements saying that the Syrian government used chemical weapons in the attack. The White House released a detailed intelligence assessment on August 30. As with past cases of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria this year, the Syrian government denied that it had conducted the attack and blamed opposition groups. Most experts observing the victims of the attack say that symptoms are consistent with the use of the nerve agent sarin, a type of chemical weapon in Syria's large arsenal.  The August 30,",
      " 2013, White House statement said that the U.S. intelligence community assesses that the Asad regime used a nerve agent in a \"large-scale coordinated rocket and artillery attack,\" which killed approximately 1,429 people. It also said that the opposition has not used chemical weapons. The U.S. government assesses that the Asad regime has used chemical weapons, including the nerve agent sarin, on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year. These assessments say that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons \"primarily to gain the upper hand or break a stalemate in areas where it has struggled to seize and hold strategically valuable territory.\"  President Obama and other world leaders have said that the use of chemical weapons against the civilian population would be met with consequences,",
      " which could include the use of military force. In statements reacting to alleged chemical weapons incidents in Syria, U.S. officials have referred to several distinct reasons why the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government raises fundamental concerns for the United States:  the unacceptability of any use of chemical weapons, given the large international consensus that views chemical weapons as having inherently malicious qualities; the targeting of a civilian population, especially in large numbers, regardless of the weapons employed; the potential for the proliferation of chemical weapons to other parties, such as those hostile to the United States; and the potential ramifications of escalated or expanded violence in Syria, including the loss of control of chemical weapons and/or their use on neighboring countries and U.S.",
      " interests in the region. These concerns are reflective of major trends in national security strategy from the past decade, including intervention on humanitarian grounds, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, and the upholding of international nonproliferation norms. What is the status of the United Nations chemical weapons inspectors report on Syria? A team of United Nations (U.N.) chemical weapons inspectors went to Syria to examine several sites where attacks were alleged to occur. The inspectors collected samples from the sites, including the site of the August 21 attack, and those samples are being studied. The team's mandate is not to assess who used the weapons,",
      " but rather to determine to the extent possible whether or not chemical weapons were used and what type. According to the U.N., the inspectors are to \"collect as many facts as possible and assess the nature of the extent of any attack using chemical weapons and its consequences.\" The determination of what chemical agents were used could also be used to draw conclusions on the source of the agents (i.e., weaponized sarin versus organo-phosphates from fertilizer or other chemicals). The inspectors were invited to Syria by the Syrian government, but they only arrived in the country on August 18\u2014just before the apparent August 21 attack\u2014after months of negotiating terms of access for the inspections.",
      " Press reports say the team will issue its report next week. Was it too late for U.N. investigators to collect evidence? Media reports have noted that the Syrian military continued to bomb the site of the August 21 attack with conventional weapons. While some physical evidence may have been destroyed at the site, blood and tissue samples from the victims themselves would help the inspectors determine what chemical agent was used. An August 27 United Kingdom joint intelligence committee assessment says, \"There is no immediate time limit over which environmental or physiological samples would have degraded beyond usefulness. However, the longer it takes inspectors to gain access to the affected sites, the more difficult it will be to establish the chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The U.N.",
      " inspectors were reportedly given access to the site and to victims of the attack. What evidence is used to determine CW use? White House statements have described the types of information that has gone into the intelligence assessments about the April 2013 use of sarin. Both the June and August 2013 intelligence assessments have said these sources of information included reporting about Syrian military attack planning and execution, descriptions of attacks, physiological symptoms consistent with exposure to chemical weapons agents, and analysis of physiological samples from multiple victims. Congress may wish to ask the Administration for information on the credibility of this evidence.  What countries have chemical weapons? What international norms exist against their use?",
      " The U.S. intelligence community cites Iran, North Korea, and Syria as having active chemical weapons programs. For decades, there has been a strong norm against the use of chemical weapons. For the past 25 years, no chemical weapons have been used in civil or cross-border warfare. Most countries that have had chemical weapons arsenals in the past have destroyed these weapons under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), or are in the process of destroying them. The CWC addresses the destruction of existing stocks, prevention of proliferation to new states, and assistance to countries that are victims of an attack, but does not prescribe consequences for CW use. Syria is not a party to the CWC.",
      " When were chemical weapons last used on civilians? The Iraqi government used chemical weapons in an attack on Kurdish civilians in the town of Halabja, northern Iraq, on March 16, 1988, killing an estimated 5,000 people. This is considered the largest chemical attack against a civilian population since German atrocities during World War II. The United States did not respond militarily to the attack. Iraq also systematically used chemical weapons against Iran during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s without a U.S. or international military response.  What has the Obama Administration said about the importance of the August 21 case? As has been widely reported in the press and in public statements,",
      " the Obama Administration has emphasized that it believes this particular use of chemical weapons may necessitate a response of some kind. Echoing a similar statement he made in August 2012, President Obama stated in an interview on August 28, 2013, that \"I have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria, but we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable.\" The Administration has confirmed the use of the nerve agent sarin in incidents earlier this year; however, the August 21 attack killed civilians on a larger scale than in past incidents.",
      " The Administration has stated that it aims to deter future use of these weapons by Syria and others, as well as to prevent these weapons from being diverted to terrorists or used against U.S. interests or allies in the region. The Administration has also emphasized the norm against the use of chemical weapons. Secretary Kerry said in a speech on August 26 that \"all peoples and all nations who believe in the cause of our common humanity must stand up to assure that there is accountability for the use of chemical weapons so that it never happens again.\" These views were reiterated in more extensive remarks by the Secretary on August 30, discussed above. However, although media speculation about possible military action abounds,",
      " U.S. officials have not directly provided specifics on what kind of response might take place and how that response could prevent future use of chemical weapons in Syria or elsewhere.  Could the United States destroy Syria's chemical weapons stocks through military action? What would be needed to secure chemical weapons sites during an intervention? While it is possible that military strikes could render chemical weapons agents unusable, according to many observers, there would be considerable risk to nearby civilian populations if Syrian chemical weapons facilities were attacked in a military strike from the air. This is because nerve agents could be dispersed into the air in the course of any strike against these facilities. One major concern of the United States is the risk that chemical weapons would fall into the hands of terrorist groups if the Syrian military lost control of or diverted them.",
      " The scale of the CW stocks in Syria would present a great challenge for physical security. General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in a July letter to Congress that \"[t]housands of special operations forces and other ground forces would be needed to assault and secure critical sites.\" The operation would result in the \"control of some, but not all chemical weapons\" and \"would also help prevent their further proliferation into the hands of extremist groups,\" the letter said. U.S. military efforts to date have focused on bolstering security near Syria's borders with neighboring countries such as Jordan and Turkey, perhaps partly to help deter any transfer of chemical weapons out of Syria.",
      " What international legal instruments ban chemical weapons use? Chemical weapons have been banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) since 1997. The CWC bans the development, production, transfer, stockpiling, and use of chemical and toxin weapons, mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons production facilities, and seeks to control the production and international transfer of the key chemical components of these weapons. The 189 member states may ask for assistance and protection if they are attacked with chemical weapons. The following countries are not parties to the CWC: Angola, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, North Korea, South Sudan, and Syria.  The 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating,",
      " Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare bans the use of chemical or biological agents in warfare against other states, but does not address the use of these weapons in internal conflicts. Syria did sign the Geneva Protocol. How would the international community take control of and destroy the Syrian chemical weapons stockpile? The Syrian government has reportedly accepted a proposal by Russia that it turn over all its chemical weapons to international control. The United Nations Security Council may discuss proposals to accomplish this goal. President Obama said on September 10 that any deal would have to ensure \"verifiable and enforceable destruction.\" Key issues would be verification,",
      " access, and security of international personnel. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is the international agency that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons once a state has joined the Chemical Weapons Convention. Because Syria is not yet a party to that convention, it would either have to join the CWC or a separate disarmament mechanism may be set up directly by the U.N. Security Council, as happened with Iraq in 1991 (U.N. Security Council Resolution 687). This would most likely use the OPCW as an implementing organization for verification and dismantlement.  The United Nations and the OPCW have had experience successfully monitoring the destruction of chemical weapons in several countries.",
      " In most cases, the country would first declare its stocks and production facilities, and then destroy the weapons under international supervision. The inspectors would verify that the amounts declared were then destroyed. In the case of Syria, as with Iraq in the 1990s, the U.N. Security Council may also mandate that Syria give access to sites that have not been declared but are suspected of holding chemical weapons. However, because Syria is in the midst of civil war, there are many risk factors that have not been present in other cases. First, a top priority is securing the chemical weapons stocks themselves. Second, the inspectors would be at great physical risk without a ceasefire in place.",
      " The conflict also would limit access of inspectors to sites of suspicion. Third, destruction of chemical weapons is a time-consuming, expensive process with great need for safety precautions. Therefore, the initial stage may focus on securing the chemical weapons at predetermined locations or shipped out of the country for storage awaiting destruction. It is not clear who would be guarding this centralized storage locations if they were inside Syria.  In addition, due to the fear that the Assad regime is using the chemical weapons destruction proposal as a way to stave off military strikes, the United States and others may choose to set deadlines for certain steps.  What did the French government propose to the U.N.",
      " Security Council? On September 10, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced France's intention to present a U.N. Security Council Resolution that would call on the Asad government to dismantle its chemical weapons program. Fabius said the resolution would be proposed under the auspices of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which would allow member states to use all possible means, including military action, to enforce it. Among other things, the resolution would (1) condemn the August 21 chemical weapons attack and punish the perpetrators of the attack in the international justice system; (2) demand that the Asad government's chemical weapons program be placed under international control and be dismantled,",
      " with mechanisms for inspection and monitoring; and (3) provide for \"extremely serious\" consequences for Syrian violation of its obligations under this agreement. Press reports say that the draft resolution France has presented to the U.N. Security Council would give Syria 15 days to issue a full declaration of its chemical weapons and facilities and open those facilities immediately to international inspectors. CRS has not independently verified the proposed draft text. The version described in press reports would also authorize measures under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter if Syria does not comply. It would appear that the U.N. Secretary General would retain the lead role in inspecting chemical facilities in coordination with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.",
      " This may be to avoid a possible delay while Syria took the necessary legal steps to accede to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which requires member states to declare and destroy their chemical weapons. As noted above, Russian officials reportedly have rejected elements of the French proposal and discussions are ongoing concerning the way forward. War Powers26 Any deployment of U.S. Armed Forces into the territory, airspace, or waters of Syria implicates generally the war powers vested in Congress under the Constitution, the foremost of which is the authority to declare war. What are the roles and responsibilities of Congress and the President pursuant to the provisions of the War Powers Resolution? The War Powers Resolution,",
      " as amended (WPR; P.L. 93-148 ), is intended to provide a process for congressional-executive branch cooperation and the assertion of congressional oversight and authority related to involving U.S. Armed Forces in armed conflict. The WPR requires the President to consult with Congress prior to introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities or situations in which hostilities are imminent, and to report to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate within 48 hours of: introducing U.S. Armed Forces into current or imminent hostilities; deploying combat-equipped U.S. Armed Forces into a foreign country's territory,",
      " airspace, or waters; or increasing substantially the number of U.S. Armed Forces already located in a foreign country. Such report is required to include the reasons necessitating such actions, the President's authority to undertake such actions, and the estimated scope and duration of the hostilities or other involvement. Authority to use force, according to the WPR, is not to be inferred from other provisions of law or treaties unless those instruments specifically authorize the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces that has occurred in each circumstance. The WPR states that unless Congress enacts a declaration of war or statutory authorization for the use of force, or Congress cannot convene due to an attack on the United States,",
      " the President must withdraw U.S. Armed Forces 60 days after introducing them into current or imminent hostilities. The 60-day period begins the day the President was required to report to Congress on such introduction of U.S. Armed Forces. The President may extend the period by 30 days to safely withdraw U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities. Each President since the WPR's enactment has refused to concede that this withdrawal requirement is appropriate under the Constitution, presumably given its possible interference with the President's powers as commander-in-chief under Article II. The WPR provides for expedited consideration of legislative proposals to either authorize continuing the involvement of U.S.",
      " Armed Forces in hostilities through joint resolution, or to require a withdrawal of U.S. Armed Forces at any time after introduction of such forces through a concurrent resolution. The use of the concurrent resolution to require U.S. Armed Forces withdrawal is considered to be an example of a \"legislative veto,\" a mechanism that has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court when included in other legislation. What are some possible considerations if Congress takes up authorization for the use of military force against Syria? A congressional declaration of war against Syria is seen as unlikely, given historical practice since World War II. If Congress considers a proposal to statutorily authorize the use of force against Syria,",
      " it might consider provisions to specify the purpose of such authorization and the objectives of the use of military force, and to place limits on the scope and duration of such authorization. It is asserted generally that statutory authorizations place the President in a stronger position legally and politically to prosecute armed conflict.  Congress has included provisions limiting the use of funds for the military in defense authorization and appropriation acts, and could include them in an authorization for use of force in Syria. H.J.Res. 58, introduced on September 9, 2013, would state that:  No funds available to any United States Government department or agency may be used for the use of force in,",
      " or directed at, Syria by the United States Armed Forces unless a subsequent Act of Congress specifically authorizes such use of force or there is an attack or imminent attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or the United States Armed Forces. Some argue, however, that any provisions attempting to circumscribe the President's ability to conduct military operations would improperly interfere with the President's commander-in-chief powers under Article II of the Constitution. In any case, if Congress does not otherwise act to limit appropriations that can be used to continue such military operations, constricting provisions in an authorization to use force will likely fail to limit the President's ability to continue any commenced military operations in Syria.",
      "  Cost and Budgetary Resources for Intervention27 Since the President's September 10, 2013, speech on Syria, congressional concerns have broadened to include the potential costs and funding sources that would be tapped to carry out either various U.S. military actions in Syria or to secure Syria's chemical weapons (CW) stockpiles and eliminate its CW capabilities. Speaker of the House John Boehner, for example, raised the question of whether the Administration plans to submit a supplemental appropriations request to Congress if \"the scope and duration of the potential military strikes exceed the initial planning\" in an August 28, 2013, letter to President Obama.",
      "  In testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 3, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry said that President Obama is asking for authorization \"to degrade and deter Bashar al Asad's capacity to use chemical weapons,\" with no American boots on the ground; Secretary Hagel characterized the operation as \"limited in duration and scope... [and] tailored to respond to the use of chemical weapons.\" Details about specific military plans have not been made publicly available so estimating the cost is speculative at this point with some potential benchmarks based on the bombing of Libya in March 2011. In response to a question about whether members of the Arab League supporting U.S.",
      " operations would \"offset any of the costs,\" Secretary of State John Kerry said that some of the Arab countries have offered to \"bear costs and to assist... and to [possibly] carry that cost.\" In recent days, some observers have suggested that the cost of securing and destroying Syria's chemical weapons stocks and possibly deliver options could be substantial but there is considerable uncertainty about both the potential cost and the sharing of those costs.  The cost of any military intervention or to secure chemical weapons stocks could range widely depending on the type and length of U.S. military actions or role in providing force protection in chemical disarmament efforts, the participation and cost-sharing by U.S.",
      " allies, and Syrian and Syrian-allied responses. Funding sources could also vary depending not only on the amount required, but also the timing. Congressional participation in decision making on costs depends on whether the Administration (1) taps currently available funding for FY2013, which appears unlikely now; (2) uses appropriations provided in FY2014 if actions take place after October 1, 2013; or (3) requests reprogrammings of existing funds or supplemental appropriations. The availability of funds may also be affected by the timing as well as the scope of costs since it is now close to the last month of the FY2013,",
      " and the Department of Defense is closely tracking funds so as to implement required sequestration cuts.  What are the range and factors that would affect the potential cost of U.S. military intervention in Syria? In a July 19, 2013, response to a letter from Senators Levin and Inhofe, chair and ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, outlined the costs of various military options but did not recommend any particular option since this is a presidential decision. According to his letter, costs could range from $500 million initially to train, advise, and assist opposition forces in a safe area outside Syria to \"as much as a billion dollars per month over the course of a year\"",
      " (up to $12 billion) to use military force to establish either a no-fly zone that would prevent the regime from using its military aircraft or a buffer zone to protect border areas next to Turkey or Jordan.  General Dempsey estimated the cost could be \"billions\" to conduct a major military campaign that appears to more extensive than the limited strike that the Administration was considering. He described that option as using \"lethal force to strike targets that enable the regime to conduct military operations, proliferate advanced weapons, and defend itself,\" by destroying military forces and units, air defense, military facilities, or headquarters. This range of options shows that the factors affecting cost include the scope of military operations (e.g., the numbers and types of forces used), and the length of the operation,",
      " which may, in turn, depend on Syrian and allied responses, as well as any participation or cost-sharing by allies.  In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on September 4, 2013, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that DOD provided a range of costs based on different options and that the current option (of a limited strike) \"would [cost] in the tens of millions of dollars, that kind of range.\" On September 4, 2013, two days later, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert suggested that the naval costs of the Syrian operation are \"not extraordinary at this point,\" partly because many of the ships involved were already forward-deployed so that their costs would already be covered in the budget but that lengthening the deployment of the Nimitz carrier and replenishing Tomahawk missiles used,",
      " which cost about $1.5 million each, could add costs.  Some observers have questioned whether these informal estimates that costs of a strike would be minimal costs are realistic. The resolution authorizing the use of force in Syria, as revised and reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requires that the President report to Congress and the Senate Foreign Relations and the House Foreign Affairs on both the status of the operation, and the \"financial costs of operations to date ten days after initiation of military operations and every 20 days thereafter until completion.\" What are the range and factors that would affect the potential cost of disarming Syria's chemical weapons capability? In the July 19,",
      " 2013, letter, General Dempsey also estimated that destroying portions of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles could require more than $1 billion a month because \"hundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines, and other enablers\" and \"thousands of special operations forces and other ground forces\" would be needed to secure critical sites. This estimate may have reflected a DOD study conducted and reported to the White House in late 2012, according to press reports, that estimated that a military effort to seize Syrian weapons stocks would require \"upwards of 75,000 troops.\" Recent press reports have repeated this 75,000 figure as suggesting that the costs of securing Syrian weapons stocks would be substantial.",
      "  This estimate of 75,000 U.S. troops does not appear to be an apt analogy because it assumes forcible entry by the United States. That scenario is very different from the international effort currently in the early stages of negotiation that is exploring a chemical disarmament effort that would be conducted with Syrian agreement under international auspices. The potential U.S. cost of such an effort would depend on Syria's agreement about who would participate in such an effort, which would provide force protection for inspectors, potential cost-sharing of inspection costs that could be conducted by a combination of government and contractor personnel, and the extent and length of the effort. While the potential costs of chemical disarmament could well be greater than a limited military strike,",
      " it is not possible at this stage to estimate those costs. What funding sources are available for U.S. military intervention in Syria? With the end of FY2013 fast approaching, it is unlikely that FY2013 funds will be tapped for either a limited military strike, temporarily off-the-table, or a chemical disarmament effort, a fact recently noted by Secretary of Defense Hagel. Funding sources would likely be FY2014 funds, reprogramming of available funds, or supplemental appropriations if expenses to conduct military intervention or chemically disarm Syria proved to be substantial. These options would be available for either a limited military strike or a chemical disarmament effort though the scope and timing of a chemical disarmament effort are unknown at this time.",
      "  According to Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, the United States now has \"moved assets in place,\" including four DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers in the Mediterranean, that could meet \"whatever [military] option the president wishes to take.\" To the extent that DOD relies on U.S. military assets now or planned to be in-place to conduct military operations, the cost of deploying those ships (military personnel, fuel, spare parts) is presumably funded with FY2013 DOD appropriations for Military Personnel and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) that were provided in the FY2013 Consolidated and Continuing Appropriations Act ( P.L.",
      " 113-6 ). The deployment of the four destroyers to the Mediterranean in preparation for Syrian operations appears to be part of the Navy's planned peacetime presence mission, and for that reason would be funded within the Navy's base budget for regular activities rather than Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) or Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), which pays for incremental war costs primarily for the Afghan war.  Brief U.S. military operations to establish a no-fly zone conducted in Libya in 2011 relied almost exclusively on existing appropriations. DOD's estimated costs were about $800 million, including offsets or savings from lower peacetime flying hours during operations.",
      " The Administration also estimated that the short-lived Libyan operation would not have significant operational impacts on the Afghan or Iraq wars. The Administration did not request supplemental appropriations for Libyan operations, relying instead on available funds and existing inventories of munitions. There is no restriction that prevents the President from using available funds to conduct wartime operations. DOD transferred OCO funds originally appropriated for another purpose to replenish the inventory of missiles expended in that operation at a later date after receiving approval from the four congressional defense committees. However, possible U.S. military intervention in Syria could be significantly different from the 2011 Libyan operation. If the scope of operations and costs proved to be larger than the Libyan operation,",
      " the Department of Defense could face some difficulties in accommodating costs within its existing budget or by shifting funds among activities\u2014particularly in view of sequestration, which was not applicable in 2011. This could also be complicated because there is uncertainty about the enactment of FY2014 appropriations. If Congress enacts a Continuing Resolution for FY2014, that funding would be available for Syrian military operations by \"cash flowing,\" a term sometimes often used by budget officials that means using currently available funds that may have been intended for either peacetime or Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) operations.  If the cost of military intervention in Syria proved to be larger than anticipated,",
      " DOD could shift funds from less urgent programs or activities by using reprogramming authority provided in DOD's annual authorization and appropriations acts. Moving funds from one appropriations account to another or, in some cases, from one type of activity to another requires the written approval of the four congressional defense committees. If the costs of the operation expanded further, the Administration might need to request supplemental appropriations, which would require full congressional approval. How might Congress limit funding for either a limited strike or a chemical disarmament effort? In addition to voting on any supplemental appropriations should they prove necessary, Congress can and has placed restrictions on the use of funds in any appropriations bill.",
      " Such restrictions can prohibit obligating (putting on contract or paying civilians) or expending (spending or outlays) funds and can be included in any appropriations act.  Past statutory language has included funding restrictions that apply: to all or only specific types of military operations (e.g., combat), or particular types of activities; after a particular date or passage of time, or are contingent on certain events taking place (e.g., negotiation of a cease-fire) or a presidential determination. Finally, funding prohibitions can be applied to the funds in a particular bill, all previous bills, or any appropriation act. Restrictions can also be placed in authorization acts.",
      "  Most recently, Representative Ted Poe introduced a resolution, H.J.Res. 58, that states that No funds available to any United States Government department or agency may be used for the use of force in, or directed at, Syria by the United States Armed Forces unless a subsequent Act of Congress specifically authorizes such use of force or there is an attack or imminent attack on the United States, its territories or possessions, or the United States Armed Forces. This amendment prohibiting the use of funds for a military actions would apply broadly\u2014to all enacted appropriations acts, past or FY2014 when enacted, with an exception should a congressional authorization be passed or in the case of a direct attack on the United States.",
      "  While the recently proposed Manchin-Heitkamp resolution ( S.J.Res. 22 ) does not directly include a funding restriction, it states that it is U.S. policy that the United States can consider using \"all elements of national power,\" (presumably referring to military action) only if the Syrian government does not sign and comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention within 45 days. This follows the pattern of prohibitions that are contingent on certain conditions and the passage of time.  How might the cost of Syrian military intervention or chemical disarmament efforts be affected by ongoing sequestration cuts in FY2013 or in FY2014 if sequestration again occurs?",
      "  Since current ship deployments in the Mediterranean are largely following current plans (with minor adjustments in schedule), ongoing sequestration cuts would not necessarily have an effect on the option of a limited military strike. In addition, the Administration's and DOD's policy has been to minimize effects on DOD's core readiness-related activities such as those deployments. The President also exempted military personnel accounts from sequestration for both FY2013 and FY2014.  The services have focused ongoing sequestration cuts on lower priority Operation & Maintenance (O&M) activities such as travel, conferences, non-training flying hours, facility upgrades, Information Technology,",
      " and depot maintenance. Although the services initially reduced some training activities to meet sequestration cuts, many of these cuts were later reversed as savings became available in other areas. At the same time, some Members of Congress and DOD spokesmen have raised concerns about readiness in later years from the current sequestration or from later cuts to the DOD budget in FY2014, which could be exacerbated by a lengthy Syrian intervention.  If Congress were to enact supplemental appropriations to cover the cost of Syrian military intervention or chemical disarmament efforts, and designated that funding as emergency, those monies would not be subject to the budget caps in the Budget Control Act (BCA). On the other hand,",
      " if Congress does not meet BCA caps, FY2014 sequestration cuts would be levied by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in early January 2014 and funds for any operations involving Syria would be part of the budgetary resources subject to those cuts. As in the case of Afghan war costs, however, DOD could choose to shield those costs from cuts by levying higher reductions on other operational activities. Military Planning48 As of September 6, U.S. military planning information is, in unclassified sources, largely speculative. Congress may, as the situation warrants, consider the following questions regarding its role in relation to U.S.",
      " and allied military plans: Which strategic objectives are proposed military operations designed to secure? How are the proposed operations tailored to meet those specific objectives? What targets would U.S. or allied military forces strike in Syria? Why? What would constitute success and how would that success advance broader U.S. policy objectives in Syria, in the region, and internationally? What would constitute failure and how might that affect U.S. objectives? Should an authorization for the use of military force be limited in terms of purpose, territory, potential targets, potential means, potential cost, or potential duration? Why or why not? Does the Administration believe that the draft authorization submitted to Congress would allow it to conduct military operations outside of Syria?",
      " Against non-state actors in Syria or elsewhere? Against the military forces of governments other than Syria? What U.S. forces and capabilities are currently able to engage targets in Syria? What potential coalition forces and capabilities are available? Which countries are willing to take part in military strikes? Which countries are willing to allow their territory, waters, and airspace to be used to facilitate proposed operations? With what conditions? How do the current prospects for international support impact the U.S. military mission in terms of risk, cost, feasibility, and likely duration? What force might the Syrian government bring to bear to resist or respond to a military operation against it? How might Syrian allies such as Russia,",
      " Iran, and non-state actors like Hezbollah respond to any U.S. military intervention? How might extremist groups seek to take advantage of any U.S. operations? How might opposition groups receiving U.S. support benefit or be put at risk by U.S. military operations? What are the \"known unknowns\" with regard to a potential U.S. military response to the alleged use of chemical weapons? Who are the most capable armed groups operating in Syria? What are their long-term political goals? Should proposed military operations be conducted in conjunction with an increase in direct support to armed or unarmed opposition groups? Why or why not? How can the United States best limit opportunities for violent extremist groups to take advantage of any proposed military strike?",
      " What threats to U.S. security and regional security might follow from these groups in the event of regime change? What have leaders in Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar told the Administration regarding their individual views of the August 21 incident and the proposed U.S. response? How does the Administration envision assisting other countries in mitigating the impact of any potential retaliation or provocation? If the U.S. conducts military strike operations in Syria, what are the next steps that military forces would take? Is the U.S. military in a position to sustain military operations in the region?",
      " Given the impact of sequestration on U.S. military operations and maintenance, as well as the continued deployment of military assets in support of operations in Afghanistan and elsewhere, are U.S. forces fully prepared to undertake both planned and contingent military operations in Syria? Would the possible dedication of already constrained U.S. military and/or DOD-contracted commercial airlift and sealift to a Syrian contingency operation have an adverse impact on U.S. retrograde operations currently underway in Afghanistan? What are some military options reportedly under consideration?49 Several media reports indicate that the United States is considering a military strike against Syria in response to the regime's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians on August 21.",
      " Numerous accounts suggest that the strategic goal of such a punitive strike would be to deter future chemical weapons use and degrade the Assad regime's capabilities to carry out future attacks. Some analysts question whether limited strikes can successfully accomplish the strategic objective of deterrence. For example, Chris Harmer, a senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, has argued that \"the Assad regime has shown an incredible capacity to endure pain and I don't think we have the stomach to deploy enough punitive action that would serve as a deterrent.\"  A report by the RAND Corporation outlined five broad possible missions for a Syrian attack using airpower. They included negating Syrian airpower;",
      " neutralizing Syrian air defenses; defending \"safe areas\" within Syria; enabling opposition forces to defeat the regime; and preventing the use of Syrian chemical weapons. These missions are in many ways complementary. The United States has developed munitions specifically designed to neutralize chemical weapons. Called \"agent defeat munitions,\" these devices use a large, high-temperature fireball to incinerate chemical agents. CRS has not yet been able to determine the number of such munitions currently in U.S. inventory. However, their potential use may be complicated by several factors:  First, the current generation of agent defeat munitions is believed to be deliverable only by aircraft,",
      " not cruise missiles; whether the United States would engage in air strikes without first suppressing Syrian air defenses is questionable. Second, due to their limited range of effects, agent defeat munitions require a precise knowledge of where the chemical weapons are stored. Syria is believed to have dispersed its chemical stocks in recent days. Third, a direct attack on chemical stocks raises the possibility of a collateral release of chemical agent. However, degrading Syria's capability to employ chemical weapons would not necessarily require strikes on the chemical stockpiles themselves. Potential U.S. attacks against the command and control network used to direct chemical use; the missiles, rocket launchers, and aircraft potentially used to deliver such weapons;",
      " and Syrian military command centers could all \"degrade\" Syria's CW capabilities without risking collateral release of chemical agents. \"Deterring\" further chemical use by Syria is a more complicated prospect, as it depends on understanding what could affect the Syrian command's calculations of gain vs. loss when considering whether to again employ chemical weapons. However, some strike options are viable and offer significant deterrent value. For example, a strike designed to degrade or disrupt Syria's air defense network could leave Syria exposed, with its leaders conscious of the potential for severe retaliation following any further CW use. Similarly, an attack to destroy the Syrian air force would reduce Syria's ability to deliver some types of chemical weapons,",
      " while also inhibiting its ability to defend against air attacks and to prosecute the civil war from the air. The Institute for the Study of War planned a notional strike to \"significantly degrade\" the Syrian air force. While not necessarily the U.S. plan, it gives a rough idea of the munitions required for such a strike. The plan required 133 Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAM), 24 Joint Stand-Off Weapons, and 24 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles. The Tomahawks could be launched from surface ships or submarines in the Mediterranean; the other weapons would be delivered by aircraft.",
      " The benefit of using so-called \"stand-off weapons\" such as a TLAM fired from a destroyer is that the firing vessel can be stationed beyond the range of Syrian anti-ship missiles. U.S. aircraft, such as the B-2 and B-52 bombers, also can carry air-launched cruise missiles.  Other proposed military options, such as establishing no-fly zones inside or outside Syria, may require a more extensive and longer-term U.S. commitment. According to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey, \"Lethal force would be required to defend the zones against air, missile, and ground attacks.... This would necessitate the establishment of a limited no-fly zone,",
      " with its associated resource requirements. Thousands of U.S. ground forces would be needed, even if positioned outside Syria, to support those physically defending the zones.\"  Operationally, Congress may wish to scrutinize the U.S. military's evaluation of the situation in evaluating a potential no-fly zone. In evaluating the situation, one may consider the nature and density of adversary air defenses, the quantity and quality of adversary air assets, geography, and availability of \"friendly\" assets. In evaluating adversaries, one may consider their strategy and tactics, their possible responses, their concept of operations, and their rules of engagement. If the United States and others were to conduct manned aerial strikes against Syria,",
      " the United States may employ its F-16 aircraft stationed in Jordan. Additionally, the Air Force's 39 th Air Base Wing is based at Incirlik air base in southern Turkey, and U.S. military action against Syria could originate from there, though it might require prior approval from Turkey's parliament. The United States may also have access to the British base at Akrotiri, Cyprus, where additional British military aircraft have been reportedly been deployed in recent days. If France were to take part in military action against Syria, it has access to an air base in the United Arab Emirates. U.S. Aid to the Opposition Arming the Syrian Opposition56  Secretary of Defense Hagel in a September 3,",
      " 2013, hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that the Administration is currently taking steps to provide arms to Syrian rebels under covert action authorities. On September 4, in a hearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Secretary of State Kerry said, \"we have seen the president take steps in response to the initial attacks of chemical weapons to increase lethal aid to the opposition. That is now known.\" The statute concerning covert action thus shapes both how the Administration can intervene in Syria under those authorities and the way in which the Administration engages with Congress and the public about any intervention. What are the limits and extent of covert action authorities with respect to Syria?",
      " Covert action is defined in statute as \"an activity or activities of the United States Government to influence political, economic, or military conditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States Government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\" Section 503 of the National Security Act of 1947 authorizes the President to conduct covert action if that action is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the United States and is important to the national security of the United States. The statute requires the President to write a \"finding\" that specifies the identifiable foreign policy objectives. The President must provide the finding to the congressional intelligence committees as soon as possible and before the initiation of the covert action.",
      " The President is not required to provide the finding to Members who are not on the intelligence committees.  The \"apparent or acknowledged\" language in the statute may limit what the Administration is willing to say publicly about its aid to the Syria opposition. The language also provides a vague limitation on the extent to which covert action authorities can be utilized to broaden support for the opposition or to take additional action in Syria beyond aid to the opposition. During past covert actions in other countries, the role of the U.S. government has sometimes become apparent or acknowledged in the course of public debate. This has not always proven to be a limiting factor regarding whether covert action authorities are applicable.",
      " Nonetheless, the broader the U.S. actions and the more those actions require an Administration to make a case to the American public, the more difficult it may become to justify activities under these authorities. What organizations may conduct covert action? Although covert action is generally the domain of the Central Intelligence Agency, the statute does not identify specific departments or agencies that may conduct covert action. Executive Order 12333, concerning United States Intelligence Activities, notes that, \"No agency except the Central Intelligence Agency (or the Armed Forces of the United States in time of war declared by the Congress or during any period covered by a report from the President to the Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution,",
      " P.L. 93-148 ) may conduct any covert action activity unless the President determines that another agency is more likely to achieve a particular objective.\" Non-Lethal Aid to the Opposition and Economic Sanctions against the Regime61 The Administration's decision and the means otherwise available to provide material support to Syria's opposition\u2014in the form of humanitarian goods and services, non-lethal aid, or military assistance\u2014face obstacles from a robust U.S. economic sanctions regime maintained against Syria for decades. These sanctions were triggered by the Syrian government's support of international terrorism, poor human rights record, and weapons proliferation.  Considering the economic sanctions, can the United States currently provide foreign aid to the Syrian opposition?",
      " Laws authorizing U.S. foreign aid programs are constructed generally to provide assistance state-to-state, and Syria is explicitly prohibited from eligibility under current appropriations. The U.S. growing interest in supporting Syrian opposition forces is further complicated by international obligations that require the United States to control exports and identify end-users to meet standards relating to terrorism, regional stability, and weapons proliferation. The President, however, has authority, notwithstanding the restrictions, to provide humanitarian aid, fund emergency response efforts in neighboring states, contribute to multinational programs that are engaged in the international response to Syria's crisis, and reprogram assistance from other programs to those that address disasters or unanticipated events.",
      " Specific laws that the President can draw upon include: Section 2(c) of the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962 (22 U.S.C. 2601(c)) authorizes the President to respond to \"unexpected urgent refugee and migration needs\" if he determines it is important to U.S. national interests to do so. Section 451 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2261) authorizes the President to draw upon up to $25 million in foreign aid in a fiscal year to respond to \"unanticipated contingencies....\" Current foreign operations appropriations (at Section 7034(f)",

Section 552(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2348a(c)) authorizes the President to provide peacekeeping operations funds (up to $15 million in funds and up to $425 million in commodities and services in a fiscal year) to respond to any \"unforeseen emergency\" if he finds it \"important to the national interests\" to do so. Section 614 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.",

He may make up to $250 million available, but not more than $50 million to one country, in a given fiscal year. In addition, section 202(a) of the Food for Peace Act (7 U.S.C. 1722(a)) authorizes the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development to \"provide agricultural commodities to meet emergency food needs through governments and public or private agencies including intergovernmental organizations such as the World Food Program and other multilateral organizations....\"",

According to the Department of State, transfer authority for Overseas Contingency Operations provided within appropriations laws, and Section 451 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which authorizes the President to use up to $25 million in one fiscal year for unanticipated contingencies, has been and continues to be crucial for providing both humanitarian and non-humanitarian aid to Syria since 2011.",

The Obama Administration has acknowledged the funding challenges that the Syria crisis presents and worked with Congress to increase the balances in global humanitarian assistance accounts in the FY2013 final appropriations bill to better meet Syria related needs. However, the Administration has not identified specific additional Syria assistance funding requests in its FY2014 appropriations budget and all indications suggest that the Administration intends to continue to fund Syria opposition assistance efforts on an ad hoc basis by presenting reprogramming requests and emergency contingency notifications to Congress.",

The international humanitarian response is immense and complex, but struggles to keep pace with urgent developments that have risen above anticipated needs. Access within Syria is severely constrained by violence and restrictions imposed by the Syrian government on the operations of humanitarian organizations.",

What have been some of the possible humanitarian policy considerations for Congress to date? What effect might military action have on the humanitarian crisis? As U.S. policy makers and the international community deliberate over what, if any, actions they can or should take on the Syria crisis, possible humanitarian policy considerations for Congress include (1) issues related to U.S. resources and determination of priorities, including other humanitarian or foreign aid concerns and domestic needs; (2) and the potential costs and benefits of labeling or \"branding\"",

Decisions on non-procedural or substantive matters require nine affirmative votes, including the concurring votes of the permanent members.

Russia also has a lease on a naval docking facility at Tartus, Syria. Russia has vetoed three U.N.

He also raised the possibility that the rebels may have gassed civilians to trigger Western action against the Asad government. He underlined that only the UNSC may approve the legitimate use of force against a sovereign state,",
      " and that the use of force outside U.N. approval is aggression. He stressed that Russia was not defending the Asad regime, but was upholding the norms and principles of international law, and warned that if illegitimate force is used against the Asad regime, there is a danger that it might again be used \"against anybody and on any pretext.\" He reiterated that Russia is supplying arms under contracts with the legitimate government of Syria, so is not violating any international laws. He admitted that some components of the S-300 surface-to-air missile system had been delivered, but the delivery of remaining components had been suspended. He stressed that Russia would not become militarily involved in the Syrian conflict.",

During his testimony on September 3, 2013, before the SFRC, Secretary Kerry raised the hope that Presidents Obama and Putin would discuss Syria during the G-20 summit in Russia, and that President Putin would have a \"change of heart\" on Syria. The Secretary stated that Russia and the United States were cooperating on efforts toward a negotiated settlement of the Syria conflict.",

The Russian presidential press secretary on September 5 urged that the international community wait for the U.N. inspectors to issue their report on whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria. He stated that, based on this report, a further investigation could then be undertaken to determine who used them. On September 5,",

The Foreign Ministry also warned that U.S. missiles could threaten nuclear contamination if they hit a Syrian research reactor. Presidential administration head Ivanov stated on September 5 that warships being sent to the Mediterranean Sea were intended for the possible evacuation of Russian citizens from Syria.",

To do so, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said on September 12, 2013, \"goes against the international law and basic norms governing international relations and will add to turmoil in Syria and the region as a whole.\" What is Driving China's Syria Policy?",
      " China's opposition to outside military intervention in Syria is rooted in its long-standing policy of non-interference in the affairs of other sovereign nations. That policy is thought to be related to China's desire to head off any foreign intervention in its own affairs. China fears, for example, the possibility of calls for international intervention in response to future Chinese efforts to unite forcibly with Taiwan, or over China's treatment of its Tibetan and Uighur ethnic minority populations. The most notable occasion on which China strayed from the principle of non-interference was in March 2011, when China joined Russia in abstaining on a U.N. resolution authorizing military action against the Gaddafi regime in Libya,",

Many in China now see the Libya resolution as having been \"abused by the U.S. and NATO to pursue regime change.\" China's Syria policy also appears to be influenced by China's close relationship with Russia, with which it often coordinates on foreign policy. Unlike Russia, however, China has limited economic interests in Syria and, according to the Chinese government, only \"20-plus\" citizens in the country.

Iran87 The Syrian regime's apparent chemical attack has created a major dilemma for Iran. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, Syria has been Iran's closest Arab ally, and, as discussed below, Iran has provided substantial resources to help the Asad regime combat the armed rebellion.",
      " Yet, perhaps in an effort to compel Iran to distance itself from the Asad regime, the international community has pointed out that Iran has long stressed that it is the foremost victim of chemical weapons use at the hands of Saddam Hussein's regime during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. United Nations investigations confirmed Iraqi chemical weapons against Iranian forces during that war, although it found that Iran has conducted some chemical attacks as well. Iran is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  What are Iran's interests in Syria? Syria under the Asad regime is a linchpin of Iranian strategy in the region\u2014Iran takes advantage of Syria's geographical location and prominence in the Arab world to pressure Israel,",

The Asad regime and Iran are linked by similar sectarian identities that distinguish them from Sunni Muslims: the Asads come from the Alawite community whose religious beliefs are distantly derived from Shiism, which is the overwhelmingly dominant sect in Iran. Along with geopolitical and other factors, this bond helped Iran and Syria transcend the Arab-Persian differences that would tend to divide them, as well as the contrasts between the Islamist nature of Iran's regime and Asad's secular rule. The regime of Bashar al Asad's father, Hafez al Asad, provided support to Iran during the 1980-",

There is little dispute among experts and officials that Iran also is sending substantial quantities of arms to the Asad regime.

There are no indications that Iran is positioning forces in the region to prepare for any retaliation. Iran also has a new president, Hassan Rouhani, a mid-ranking cleric, who has pledged to ease tensions with the international community\u2014a goal that would most likely be significantly set back were Iran to retaliate for any U.S. strike on Syria.  However, sources purportedly close to Iran's ally, Hezbollah (cited elsewhere in this report) have indicated that it might retaliate against Israel under certain circumstances.",
      " Additionally, Iran and Hezbollah have agents and cells in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and elsewhere that could conduct future acts of terrorism as a response to a U.S. attack on Syria. Such actions might have an element of deniability that Iran perceives could prevent any immediate U.S. retaliation.  Some experts believe that a U.S. strike on Syria might not cause Iranian retaliation, but could cause Iran to break off talks with the international community over its nuclear program. Talks have been conducted, without firm conclusions, since 2003, but international negotiators have become more optimistic for the prospects of the talks since Rouhani assumed Iran's presidency on August 4,",
      " 2013. Iran has not, to date, threatened to boycott a new round of talks if and when a date for them is set.  Others argue that a U.S. refusal to respond militarily to Asad's apparent use of chemical weapons could affect Iran's nuclear calculations. According to this argument, Iran might interpret a U.S. failure to act militarily as an indication that the Obama Administration might not enforce its stated policy of preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, if Iran were to undertake an effort to produce a nuclear weapon.  European and NATO Perspectives95 The 28 member states of the European Union (EU) have said that there is strong evidence that the Asad regime is responsible for a chemical attack on August 21 and have called for a \"clear and strong\"",
      " international response. There is disagreement, however, on what form such a response should take, and widespread skepticism and reluctance on the question of possible offensive military action. Collective military operations against the Asad government through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or the EU therefore do not appear to be a possibility. European leaders have also emphasized the importance of working through the U.N., saying on September 7 that any further action against the Asad regime should not come before an expected preliminary U.N. report on the alleged chemical weapons attack.  According to the State Department, as of September 5, the following European countries had \"publicly and explicitly expressed support for U.S.",
      " military action,\" against Asad: Albania, Kosovo, Denmark, France, Poland, Romania, and Turkey. France appears to be the only European country considering participating in such military action, however, and has said it would not act alone. United Kingdom The UK government has been leading international pressure against the Asad regime in Syria. Alongside France, the UK has pushed for United Nations action, has been a leading voice in passing EU sanctions against the Asad regime, and successfully argued for lifting the EU arms embargo in order to assist opposition forces. Although it has not openly delivered weapons to the opposition, the UK has reportedly provided non-lethal equipment,",
      " humanitarian assistance, and some training. Following the report of chemical weapons attacks by Syrian forces on August 21, the UK's National Security Council \"decided unanimously that the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime is unacceptable and that the world can not stand by in the face of that.\" The government's campaign to build a case for military action abruptly deflated, however, when the House of Commons voted on August 29 against UK participation in any prospective strikes on the Asad regime, and Prime Minister Cameron subsequently ruled it out. Prime Minister Cameron has since refuted suggestions that the government might go back to Parliament for a second vote on the use of force if circumstances in Syria change significantly,",
      " or following a vote by the U.S. Congress. Speculation about a potential second vote nevertheless continues, but as of early September, UK involvement is expected to consist primarily of intelligence support, diplomatic pressure, and increased humanitarian aid.  France100  Along with the UK, the French government has been leading international efforts to pressure the Asad regime. France was the first country to recognize the Syrian Opposition Coalition (SOC) as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people.\" Officials in Paris have said there is \"no doubt\" that Asad has used chemical weapons and have said that they favor military strikes against Asad in response. France reportedly has deployed an anti-aircraft frigate and other military assets off the Syrian coast in anticipation of such an operation.",
      " Officials in Paris have indicated, however, that French military action would come only in support of a U.S.-led operation. Since President Obama's announcement that he would seek congressional approval for U.S. military action, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has faced growing public pressure to follow suit. The French parliament debated the merits of a possible intervention in early September, but has not held a vote on the issue and parliamentary approval for such action is not required. Nonetheless, in the view of some commentators, Hollande could become increasingly sensitive to public opposition to possible military intervention\u2014some opinion polls indicate that more than two-thirds of respondents in France are opposed. In what was perceived as an effort to build public and international support,",
      " on September 6, Hollande said he would not authorize military action before the release of an anticipated U.N. report on the use of chemical weapons in Syria. On September 10, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius announced France's intention to present a U.N. Security Council Resolution that would call on the Asad government to dismantle its chemical weapons program. Fabius said the resolution would be proposed under the auspices of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which would allow member states to use all possible means, including military action, to enforce it. Among other things, the resolution would (1) condemn the August 21 chemical weapons attack and punish the perpetrators of the attack in the international justice system;",
      " (2) demand that the Asad government's chemical weapons program be placed under international control and be dismantled, with mechanisms for inspection and monitoring; and (3) provide for \"extremely serious\" consequences of Syrian violation of its obligations under this agreement. French officials reportedly have said they are willing to amend their resolution in response to Russian concerns. Germany104 The German government has strongly condemned the Asad regime, calling its alleged use of chemical weapons a \"horrific crime against humanity... that cannot go unpunished.\" Berlin is reportedly reluctant, however, to endorse a military response that is not authorized by the U.N. Security Council.",
      " Germany is also considered unlikely to participate in any military operation in Syria, even if under a U.N. or NATO mandate. Analysts note that the German government could be particularly sensitive to public opposition to potential offensive military action ahead of a federal election scheduled for September 22. The German government reportedly has agreed to allow 5,000 Syrian refugees to resettle in Germany by the end of the year. NATO What is NATO's role? At the request of NATO member state Turkey, since the beginning of 2013, NATO has carried out an air defense mission along Turkey's southeastern border with Syria, \"to augment Turkey's air defence capabilities in order to defend the population and territory of Turkey and contribute to the de-",
      "escalation of the crisis along the Alliance's border.\" NATO officials have emphasized that the deployment of six Patriot missile batteries \"is defensive only. It will in no way support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation.\" The United States, Germany, and the Netherlands are each operating two Patriot batteries, deployed to military bases near the population centers of Gaziantep, Karamanmaras, and Adana, respectively.  Some Members of Congress, as well as Air Force General Philip Breedlove, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, and Commander of U.S. European Command (in his Senate confirmation hearing), have suggested that the Patriot batteries currently under NATO command could be used to support offensive military operations against Asad,",
      " including the possible establishment of a no-fly zone or a \"humanitarian corridor\" to protect civilians. Although the allies have uniformly condemned the Asad regime, NATO has not considered establishment of a no-fly zone and key allied officials have reiterated that the Patriot deployment is defensive only. Speaking on behalf of the allies on August 28, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the use of chemical weapons, \"a clear breach of long-standing international norms and practice... that cannot go unanswered.\" However, there does not appear to be a consensus within the alliance on endorsing possible NATO-led offensive military operations against the Asad regime. Any NATO operation would require the unanimous backing of the member states,",
      " though not all would be obliged to participate.  European Union What is the European Union's role? The EU has been a leading voice alongside the United States in international condemnation of the Asad regime and its actions in Syria's armed conflict. With a stronger U.N. response blocked by Russia and China in the Security Council, the EU has moved ahead on the basis of unanimous agreement among its member states to impose extensive sanctions designed to put pressure on the regime. Like the United States, in December 2012 the EU recognized the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. After a British and French push to lift the EU arms embargo on Syria in order to arm opposition forces,",
      " the embargo was allowed to expire in May 2013 despite strong objections from a number of other EU countries. As a result, arms exports to the opposition could be authorized on a national, case-by-case basis, with safeguards intended to prevent misuse, although the EU member states agreed to refrain from such deliveries pending a review of the situation. Similar to NATO, there is no consensus among EU member states for military operations. In any case, analysts have had no expectations that any such operations would be conducted under an EU flag. At the G20 Summit held in St. Petersburg on September 5-6, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy reportedly stated that there is no military solution to the Syria conflict.",
      " Despite efforts led by France to gain backing for potential military action, this viewpoint was subsequently conveyed as the agreed position of the 28 member states by High Representative Catherine Ashton in a statement following an EU foreign ministers meeting on September 7.  Turkey Since late 2011, the government of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been an active opponent of the Asad regime and has outspokenly advocated for U.N.-backed intervention. It has hosted Syrian refugees and opposition figures and\u2014reportedly\u2014helped funnel assistance to armed Syrian rebel groups. Following the apparent August 21 chemical weapons attack, Erdogan has indicated that Turkey would \"take part\"",
      " in any international coalition against Syria. On August 30, Erdogan was quoted as saying that any strike on Syria should not be a \"24 hours hit-and-run. What matters is stopping the bloodshed in Syria and weakening the regime to the point where it gives up.\" Notwithstanding Erdogan's stated preference for a broader military response than what U.S. officials appear to be contemplating, the nature and scope of potential Turkish involvement is unclear. Turkey maintains one of NATO's largest militaries, but political sensitivities and potential vulnerabilities vis-\u00e0-vis bordering countries and Kurdish communities in the region could constrain its direct participation in military operations. Asked what Turkey's role might be,",
      " as reports on September 8 indicated that it was bolstering its border defenses, Erdogan was quoted as saying, \"Whether it would be as an opposing force or supplying forces to provide logistical support, all this would be determined by circumstances.\" Turkey hosts U.S. and NATO military assets in various locations throughout the country, which could be among the targets of potential Syrian or Syrian-allied retaliation for a U.S.-led attack. Members of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), though condemning the possible use of chemical weapons in Syria, have warned of the risks of military intervention and insisted that Turkish law requires parliamentary approval of any use of Turkish territory by foreign troops to attack Syria.",
      " The Turkish parliament voted in 2003 against allowing the United States to invade Iraq from its Turkish border. Arab States117 Arab countries have staked differing positions on the Syrian civil war and have backed different rebel/political groups, perpetuating the divisiveness and disorganization of the armed and unarmed Syrian opposition. Until recently, Qatar had aggressively backed the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood in exile as well as various Islamist-oriented armed groups on the ground. There are some indications that the recent leadership transition in Qatar may result in a recalibration of Doha's former embrace of Islamist activists. Saudi Arabia, which also has backed its own militias, has been less supportive of more radical elements in the Syrian political and armed opposition.",
      " Private entities in the Arab Gulf states continue to provide material and political support to extremist groups operating in Syria. Egypt, where the military has returned to power after ousting a president who had hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood, may be even less inclined than Saudi Arabia to support Sunni Islamist Syrian rebels, though it has been preoccupied with internal issues throughout the war's duration.  What is the position of the Arab League? Publicly, many Arab states are hesitant to endorse a possible Western military intervention in Syria. Nevertheless, on August 27, the Arab League, which had already suspended Syria from its membership back in 2011, issued a joint statement on the apparent August 21 chemical weapons attack,",
      " stating that it held \"the Syrian regime responsible for this heinous crime.\" The statement also called on the United Nations Security Council to \"overcome the disagreements between its members'' [so it could] ''take the necessary deterring measures against the perpetrators of this crime.\" The Arab League has modified its original position insisting on U.N. Security Council action to call for the Security Council and the international community to \"take the deterrent and necessary measures against the culprits of this crime for which the Syrian regime bears responsibility.\" Israel and Its Concern for Potential Retaliation118 An important U.S. concern regarding possible military action against Syria is potential retaliation by Syria and its allies\u2014especially Iran and Lebanon-based Hezbollah,",
      " but also possibly Gaza-based militants such as Palestine Islamic Jihad \u2014against Israel. Possible threats of retaliation against other U.S. regional allies (including Turkey, Jordan, and Gulf Arab states) are linked to these countries' involvement in aiding the Syrian opposition and potentially serving as bases for U.S.-led military operations. Even though Israel has reportedly carried out limited strikes in Syria this year to prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah, retaliatory threats against it appear to stem less from its recent involvement in the conflict than from historical and geopolitical animosities and probable desires among Syria and its allies to deter the United States from acting militarily\u2014given long-standing U.S.",
      " interests in Israel's security.  At least since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, U.S. regional military planning has taken into account the possibility of attacks on Israel and the potential for any Israeli response to trigger wider regional war. In the present case, U.S. consideration of this factor is seemingly being weighed alongside concerns about possible consequences for Israel (in connection with overarching questions about defense of U.S. allies and U.S. credibility) if either the United States does not respond to the Asad regime's apparent use of chemical weapons in Syria, or any response it makes is ineffective. In September 3 hearing testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the possible use of U.S.",
      " military force in Syria, Secretary Kerry said: I can make it crystal clear to you that Israel will be less safe unless the United States takes this action. Iran and Hezbollah are two of the three biggest allies of Assad. And Iran and Hezbollah are the two single biggest enemies of Israel. So, if\u2014Iran and Hezbollah are advantaged by the United States not curbing Assad's use of chemical weapons, there is a much greater likelihood that at some point down the road, Hezbollah, who has been one of the principal reasons for a change in the situation on the ground, will have access to these weapons of mass destruction. Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said,",
      " \"Now the whole world is watching. Iran is watching and it wants to see what would be the reaction on the use of chemical weapons.\" Yet, some accounts indicate that Israeli officials \"have little desire to see [Asad] toppled,\" given what may follow, and are \"wary of creating any perception that they are meddling in either American politics or the civil war in neighboring Syria.\"  American Jewish and self-described \"pro-Israel\" organizations are participating in the public discourse on the question of U.S. intervention. According to a Washington Post article, \"groups such as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations called for bipartisan consensus [on September 3]",
      " around the use of force.\" J Street, another organization, issued an August 29 statement on its website that read, \"As President Obama and world leaders contemplate the appropriate course of action, we are cognizant that there are no easy or clear-cut solutions.\" What threats exist from Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Gaza-based militants regarding potential retaliation against Israel in the event of a U.S.-led strike on Syria? Syrian and Iranian officials have made statements indicating that Israel would be a target of retaliation in the event of a U.S.-led attack on Syria. General Mohammad Ali Jafari, chief of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was quoted as saying that an attack on Syria \"means the immediate destruction of Israel.\" In an August 28 Lebanese news report,",
      " a source supposedly close to Hezbollah was cited as saying that Hezbollah would probably not retaliate against Israel in the event of a limited U.S.-led strike, but would likely retaliate in the event of a \"large-scale Western strike\" that aims to \"change the balance of power in Syria.\" A source that supposedly liaises between Hezbollah and the Syrian military was cited as saying that a potential Hezbollah retaliation against Israel for a U.S. strike would take place from the Syrian city of Homs to \"keep Lebanon out of the war.\" An Israeli military spokesman has publicly stated that although Israel is preparing for the contingency of Syrian or Syrian-allied retaliation against Israel in response to a U.S.-led strike,",
      " the probability of retaliation is low. Israeli calculations that retaliation is possible but unlikely probably owe to a presumption that Israel's adversaries do not want to risk escalating and expanding the conflict beyond its current level and scope. What damage could retaliatory rocket or missile strikes do to Israel, and how prepared is Israel to defend itself? If one or more of them chose to retaliate, Syria, Iran, Hezbollah, and Gaza-based militants could threaten Israeli territory\u2014as indicated by the range maps (see below)\u2014with thousands of rockets and missiles of varying ranges, accuracies, and payloads (i.e., high-explosives or possible chemical warheads in the case of Syrian SCUDs). In addition to insisting that it would respond forcefully to any attack on its territory,",
      " and calling up reserve military units, Israel maintains multiple anti-rocket and anti-missile platforms largely through U.S. assistance and/or co-production: Iron Dome, Patriot, and Arrow II. Israel claims substantial success with Iron Dome in countering rockets with ranges under about 75 km. The Patriot and Arrow II systems are designed to intercept Syrian SCUD missiles (ranges of 300-500 km). Iranian SCUDs are not capable of reaching Israel. It is unclear whether\u2014and perhaps unlikely that\u2014Patriot or Arrow II systems are capable of intercepting very short-range Hezbollah tactical missiles that could reach central and southern Israel. Reports indicate that transportable Iron Dome batteries have been deployed to various locations throughout the country,",
      " including Jerusalem. Although the U.S.-Israel cooperative platform David's Sling has supposedly been tested successfully against short-range tactical missiles (40-300 km), this system is not expected to be operational until about 2014. It is possible that some David's Sling units may have been deployed recently, but its availability to counter missiles from Hezbollah is unknown. There are no systems currently deployed in Israel that are designed to intercept Iranian medium-range ballistic missiles (1,500-2,000 km). The Arrow III, which is designed to counter such missiles, had a successful test launch in 2013, but is not expected to be operational until about 2014-",
      "2015.  Israel is preparing additional measures on the home front to absorb a possible retaliatory strike. In previous instances\u20141991 during the Gulf War, 2006 against Hezbollah, and on two occasions (2008-2009 and November 2012) against Hamas and other Palestinian militants\u2014many Israelis took cover in bomb shelters and in safe rooms that are now routinely built into their residences. According to reports, approximately 50 Israeli civilians were directly killed by missile and rocket strikes during these three conflicts combined. There are concerns, however, that the more advanced missiles likely to be used in any retaliation from Iran, Syria, or Hezbollah could produce casualties and damage of a higher magnitude.",
      " In addition, a significant portion of the population may not have ready access to bomb shelters, and logistical complications and expense could delay full distribution of gas masks, which large numbers of Israelis are seeking in the event of a chemical weapons attack. Outlook Intense current speculation centers around the potential for punitive U.S.-led military strike on Syrian government forces and the Russian government's proposed disarmament plan for Syria. Action on either of these initiatives would have major implications for the ongoing conflict in Syria and the international crisis the conflict has created. Given stated U.S. objectives and fears of a deeper power vacuum in Syria, it appears unlikely that any U.S.",
      " actions in the immediate future would attempt to eliminate the Asad regime entirely. President Obama has said \"I have no interest in any kind of open-ended conflict in Syria,\" and, at present, U.S. officials hope to achieve a negotiated political settlement to establish a new government that can keep the Syrian state intact, secure its chemical weapon stockpiles, secure its borders, and prevent or combat terrorism.  The importance of the war in Syria for broader U.S. national security policy objectives may be linked more to its consequences for regional and global stability than to the details and outcome of the Syrian conflict itself. The civil war has sharpened divisions between the United States and some members of the European Union on the one hand and Russia and China on the other over competing concepts of how the international community should enforce peace and security and defend international norms.",
      " In the wake of the Libya conflict, the latter countries have continually opposed U.S. and European efforts to use the United Nations Security Council to endorse the protection of civilians in Syria. It remains to be seen whether the members of the Security Council will find a mutually acceptable formula for implementing the proposed disarmament initiative. The war also has raised concern that transnational terrorist groups modeled on Al Qaeda in Afghanistan-Pakistan may be resurgent in Syria and may gain access to advanced conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, the Syrian government's alleged use of chemical weapons against its opponents and civilians is not only a serious development in the Syrian conflict but a potential precedent for other countries with possible chemical,",
      " biological, or nuclear programs. How the United States and others respond in the days and weeks ahead will most likely be watched closely in countries concerned with the potential for confrontation over similar programs in Iran and North Korea. The war in Syria also has been a major dividing line within the United States over competing visions of U.S. foreign policy. Some commentators continue to assert that the American public is \"war-weary,\" and that military intervention is inadvisable when public backing for expending \"blood and treasure\" on an operation of any duration and scope is uncertain. Others suggest that U.S. global leadership is needed more than ever to steer the country and its people away from what some see as isolationist tendencies.",
      "  Appendix. Analysis of Proposed Authorizations for the Use of Military Force as of September 6, 2013 The following analysis is based on the following texts available as of September 6, 2013: Administration Draft Proposal: CNN, Text of draft legislation submitted by Obama to Congress, August 31, 2013. S.J.Res. 21 : Available online from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S.%20J.%20Res.%2021.pdf Draft Proposal from Representatives Van Hollen and Connolly: Available at: http://www.lawfareblog.com/wp-content/uploads/",

    "answer": "Reports of a mass casualty chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of Damascus are reshaping the long-running and contentious debate over possible U.S. intervention in Syria's bloody civil war. Obama Administration officials and some foreign governments report that on August 21, 2013, forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al Asad attacked opposition-controlled areas in the suburbs of the capital with chemical weapons, killing hundreds of civilians, including women and children. The Syrian government has denied the accusations categorically and blames the opposition for the attack. United Nations inspectors who were in Syria to investigate other alleged chemical weapons attacks collected and are analyzing information related to the incident. Varying accounts suggest that several hundred to more than 1,000 people were killed from exposure to a poisonous gas, with symptoms consistent with exposure to the nerve agent sarin.  Possible punitive U.S. military action against the Asad regime is now the subject of intense debate, amid the broader ongoing discussion of U.S. policy toward the Syrian civil war and its regional consequences. The August 21 incident is the latest in a string of reported instances where Syrian forces appear to have used chemical weapons despite President Obama's prior statement that the transfer or use of chemical weapons is \"a red line\" that would \"change his calculus.\" The President and senior members of his Administration have argued that the United States has a national security interest in ensuring that \"when countries break international norms on chemical weapons they are held accountable.\" At the same time, President Obama still maintains that extensive, sustained U.S. military intervention to shape the outcome of Syria's civil conflict is undesirable. Prior to the August 21 incident, U.S. military leaders had outlined options to accomplish a range of U.S. objectives, while warning that U.S. military involvement \"cannot resolve the underlying and historic ethnic, religious and tribal issues that are fueling this conflict.\" Alternatives to military action also are under intense consideration. On September 10, Syrian officials responded to a Russian disarmament proposal by signaling their willingness \"to disclose the locations of chemical weapons, to stop producing them, and to reveal these locations to representatives of Russia, other states, and the United Nations\" with the goal of \"ending our possession of all chemical weapons.\" Members of the United Nations Security Council began discussing proposals to implement an international framework for such a disarmament initiative. Members of Congress have expressed a broad range of views on the question of an immediate U.S. military response and the proposed disarmament initiative. Some express support for military action and others express opposition or question how a military response would advance broader U.S. policy goals. Similarly, some Members seek to explore the potential of disarmament proposals and others warn that it may delay a forceful U.S. response or undermine U.S. policy with regard to Syria's civil war. For more than two years, many Members of Congress have debated the potential rewards and unintended consequences of deeper U.S. involvement in Syria. Some Members express concern that the Administration's policy of providing support to the fractured Syrian opposition could empower anti-American extremist groups, while others warn that failure to back moderate forces could prolong fighting and strengthen extremists.  As Members of Congress consider the merits of possible military intervention in Syria, they also are reengaging in long-standing discussions about the proper role for Congress in authorizing and funding U.S. military action abroad and the use of force in shaping global events or deterring dictatorships from committing atrocities. This report attempts to provide answers to a number of policy questions for lawmakers grappling with these short- and long-term issues.\n",

    "context": "Most Recent Developments On September 29, 2006, Congress passed the Department of Defense FY2007 Appropriation bill ( H.R. 5631 / P.L. 109-289 ), which included a continuing resolution (CR) providing funding for Science, State, Justice and Commerce (SSJC) and related agencies through November 17, 2006. The funding is the lesser of House- or Senate-passed funding levels for FY2007 or the FY2006 enacted level. On November 15, 2006, Congress passed a second CR ( H.J.Res. 100 ), which extended funding provided in the initial continuing resolution through December 8, 2006. On December 8, the House passed a third CR ( H.J.Res. 102 ) extending funding through February 15, 2007. The Senate passed the measure on December 9. On February, 15, 2007, the 110 th Congress passed P.L. 110-5 , which amended P.L. 109-289 ( H.J.Res. 20 ) the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 extending appropriations through FY2007. The House passed its SSJC appropriation bill ( H.R. 5672 / H.Rept. 109-520 / S.Rept. 109-280 ) on June 29, providing a total of $63.1 billion. The House funding level included $22.5 billion for the Department of Justice, $5.9 billion for the Department of Commerce and related agencies, $22.7 billion for the Science agencies, $9.7 billion for the Department of State and international broadcasting, and $2.3 billion for related agencies. The Senate CJS Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its version of the bill on July 11, and the full Senate committee began working on the bill on July 13. The Senate version recommends $22.0 billion for Justice, $7.1 billion for Commerce, $23.8 billion for Science, and $2.3 billion for related agencies. Department of State funding is in H.R. 5522 ( S.Rept. 109-277 ) and contains $9.6 billion for the State Department and international broadcasting. The Administration submitted its FY2007 budget to Congress on February 6, 2006. The Administration requested $62.5 billion for the agencies under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations (SSJC) subcommittee of the House and $52.3 billion for the Agencies under the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations subcommittee in the Senate. The Administration requests for the major departments and their related agencies are Department of Justice, $21.3 billion; Department of Commerce, $6.3 billion; Department of State, $10.2 billion; Science, $22.8 billion; and Related Agencies, $2.3 billion. The President signed the FY2006 Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies (SSJC) appropriations bill into law on November 22, 2005 ( P.L. 109-108 ). The law provided $62.1 billion ($63.1 billion including FY2006 supplementals) for the agencies under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations subcommittee of the House. The estimated appropriations of the major departments and their related agencies (after rescissions and supplementals) were Department of Justice, $21.7 billion; Department of Commerce, $6.6 billion; Department of State, $9.5 billion; Science, $22.2 billion; and Related Agencies, $3.2 billion. Appropriations bills reflect the jurisdiction of the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in which they are considered. Jurisdictions for the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees were changed at the beginning of the 109 th Congress. In the 108 th Congress, both the House and Senate subcommittees had identical jurisdiction and produced the Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies appropriations bills. In the 109 th Congress, jurisdiction for the Judiciary appropriation was removed to the Treasury, Transportation, HUD Subcommittees in the House and the Senate. Science appropriations, namely the National Aeronautical and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation, were transferred to the former CJS subcommittees in both chambers. In the Senate, appropriations for the Department of State were transferred to the Foreign Operations subcommittee; however, they remain under the jurisdiction of SSJC in the House. In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee has placed the National Institute of Science and Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under its Title III Science Agencies. For the purposes of comparison, this report will retain reference to these agencies in Title II Commerce agencies. Background Information Synopsis of FY2006 Appropriations The Administration requested $64.2 billion/$54.2 billion for SSJC/CJS appropriations in its FY2006 budget request sent to Congress on February 7, 2005. The House Appropriations Committee reported its SSJC bill ( H.R. 2862 , H.Rept. 109-118 ) on June 7, 2005, and the House passed the bill on June 16 after three days of debate and 43 amendments. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its bill ( H.R. 2862 , S.Rept. 109-88 ) on June 23, 2005. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its State, Foreign Operations Appropriation bill ( H.R. 3057 / S.Rept. 109-96 ) June 30. It contains the Senate figures of $9,709.2 for the Department of State, International Broadcasting, and related agencies. The full Senate passed the bill on July 20. The Senate passed the CJS bill by a vote of 91-4 on September 15, 2005, after consideration of 122 amendments. The Conference Report ( H.Rept. 109-272 ) was filed on November 7, 2005. The House approved the measure by a vote of 397-19 on November 9; the Senate approved it on November 11 by a vote of 94-5. It was signed into law by President Bush on November 22, 2005 ( P.L. 109-108 ). The FY2006 appropriations were subject to a 1.28% across-the-board rescission, reflecting Sec. 638, P.L. 109-108 and P.L. 109-148 . Departmental Funding Trends The table below shows funding trends for the major agencies in CJS appropriations over the five-year period FY2002-FY2006, including supplemental appropriations. Over the five-year period, funding decreased for the Department of Justice by $2.082 billion (-8.8%). Funding increased for the Department of Commerce by $0.735 billion (12.8%), for the Title III Science Agencies by $2.473 billion (12.5%), and for the Department of State by $1.559 billion (21.2%). The Justice Department's budget declined from FY2002 to FY2003 by 17% when it was reduced by more than $4 billion due to the relocation of some activities to the Department of Homeland Security. The Justice Department total has continued to be below the FY2002 total. The Commerce Department budget has generally increased, with a slight decrease in FY2006 over the previous year due primarily to the rescissions applied to FY2006 enacted appropriations. The Science Agencies' funding has shown a gradual increase each of the five years; the State Department's increases each year through FY2005 reflect funding for the U.S. embassy in Iraq, embassy security, and international peacekeeping, largely through emergency supplemental appropriations. Survey of High-Profile Issues Department of Justice The President's FY2007 budget request proposes the consolidation of the state, local, and tribal law enforcement grant programs, the Weed and Seed program, and juvenile justice programs into the Justice Assistance account of the Office of Justice Programs (OJP). The FY2007 President's request would eliminate funding for a number of OJP programs, such as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) program ($327.2 million in FY2006 after earmarks for Boys and Girls Clubs and National Institute of Justice), the Edward Byrne Discretionary Grants ($189.3 million in FY2006), Indian Country Prison Grants ($8.9 million in FY2006), and Tribal Court Grants ($7.9 million in FY2006). The Administration's budget request proposes an increase in funding for the Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) initiative, a program administered by ATF that is designed to combat firearms-related crime, to reach a level of $395 million. Under the President's budget proposal, the restructured PSN program would include Project ChildSafe, State and Local Gun Crime Prosecution Assistance/ Project Sentry, Gang Technical Assistance Program, Weed and Seed Program/Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO), National Stalker and Domestic Violence Database, and National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP). The FY2007 President's budget proposes funding for expanding and improving Drug Courts, providing $69 million for the program, an increase of $60 million over the FY2006 enacted appropriations. The FY2007 budget proposal included funding of $40 million for the Meth Hot Spots program, a program designed to provide state and local law enforcement assistance in cleaning up toxic waste sites created through the illicit production of methamphetamine. The proposed funding level represented an increase of $20 million over funding enacted in FY2006. The President's FY2007 request for DEA included a proposal to transfer the High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to DOJ and to coordinate the program with the efforts of the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) and other antidrug efforts that are part of DEA's comprehensive drug enforcement strategy. The budget request proposes $208 million for HIDTA funding in FY2007. Department of Commerce and Related Agencies Key issues include the following: Appropriations measures that limit the use by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) of the full amount of fees collected in the current fiscal year. A proposed shift from funding to support industrial technology development programs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, particularly the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and congressionally directed projects, to a greater concentration on funding basic research in the physical sciences as part of the President's \"American Competitiveness Initiative.\" For FY2007, the Bush Administration has requested that $45 million be added to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) budget to fund the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund, as mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. There is a 2008 deadline for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction unused analog spectrum and a February 17, 2009, deadline for converting all U.S. analog television transmissions to digital. Policymakers will likely consider this budget request with regard to whether it will achieve this goal, and how NTIA will assist in the conversion process. Possible termination of the Census Bureau's longitudinal Survey of Income and Program Participation and its proposed replacement with a new data collection system focusing on income and wealth dynamics. Consolidation of 18 federal economic and community development programs in the Administration's proposed \"Strengthening America's Communities Initiative,\" reduction of their aggregate funding levels, and creation of a new Regional Development Account within the Economic Development Administration. The ability of U.S. trade agencies and PTO to fight intellectual property infringement abroad. The efficacy of U.S. trade agency enforcement of U.S. trade remedy laws against unfair foreign competition. The possible consolidation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) budget authority under a single Organic Act and Congress's review of NOAA satellite programs. Proposed terminations of several ocean-related programs, provoking criticism from the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative. Science Agencies Key issues are as follows: President Bush's \"Vision for Space Exploration\" and its consequent reprioritization of NASA programs, and potential personnel cuts (especially in aeronautics research). Whether to use the space shuttle to service the Hubble Space Telescope. Department of State and International Broadcasting Key issues include the following: Secretary Rice's newly announced vision for diplomacy referred to as Transformational Diplomacy, which will involve reorganizing parts of USAID and State. Moving of diplomats away from Washington and Europe to countries where the Administration deems more critical need. Increased emphasis on critical need language capabilities within the Department. Greater emphasis on public diplomacy activities conducted by all State Department personnel overseas. Department of Justice1 Background Title I of the SSJC/CJS bill typically covers appropriations for the Department of Justice (DOJ). Established by an act of 1870 (28 U.S.C. 501) with the Attorney General at its head, DOJ provides counsel for citizens and protects them through law enforcement. It represents the federal government in all proceedings, civil and criminal, before the Supreme Court. In legal matters, generally, the Department provides legal advice and opinions, upon request, to the President and executive branch department heads. The major functions of DOJ agencies and offices are described below. United States Attorneys prosecute criminal offenses against the United States, represent the federal government in civil actions, and initiate proceedings for the collection of fines, penalties, and forfeitures owed to the United States. United States Marshals Service provides security for the federal judiciary, protects witnesses, executes warrants and court orders, manages seized assets, detains and transports unsentenced prisoners, and apprehends fugitives. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigates violations of federal criminal law; helps protect the United States against terrorism and hostile intelligence efforts; provides assistance to other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies; and shares jurisdiction with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) over federal drug violations. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigates federal drug law violations; coordinates its efforts with state, local, and other federal law enforcement agencies; develops and maintains drug intelligence systems; regulates legitimate controlled substances activities; and conducts joint intelligence-gathering activities with foreign governments. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal law related to the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. It was transferred from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice by the Homeland Security Act of 2002 ( P.L. 107-296 ). Federal Prison System provides for the custody and care of the federal prison population, the maintenance of prison-related facilities, and the boarding of sentenced federal prisoners incarcerated in state and local institutions. Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages and coordinates the activities of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Institute of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and the Office of Victims of Crime. Most crime control has traditionally been a state and local responsibility. With the passage of the Crime Control Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-351), however, the federal role in the administration of criminal justice has increased incrementally. Since 1984, Congress has approved five major omnibus crime control bills, designating new federal crimes, penalties, and additional law enforcement assistance programs for state and local governments. For FY2007, Congress appropriated $22.692 billion for discretionary DOJ programs, an increase of $977.9 million over FY2006 appropriations. Government Performance and Results Act The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) required the Department of Justice, along with other federal agencies, to prepare a five-year strategic plan, including a mission statement, long-range goals, and program assessment measures. The Department's Strategic Plan for FY2003-2008 sets forth four goals: prevent terrorism and promote national security; enforce federal criminal laws and represent the rights and interests of the American people; prevent and reduce crime and violence by assisting state, local, and tribal efforts; ensure the fair and efficient operation of the Federal justice system. FY2007 Budget Request The Department of Justice FY2007 budget request included $21.494 billion in spending. The FY2007 budget request would have represented a decrease of $220 million over appropriations enacted by Congress for FY2006 (see Table 3 ). According to DOJ budget justifications, the President's FY2007 budget request included increased funding for preventing terrorism and ensuring domestic security of $386 million over FY2006 enacted levels. For reducing violent crime, gun crime, illegal drug trafficking, and white collar crime, the FY2007 budget request included $9 billion, which would have been an increase of $489 million over FY2006 enacted levels. Support for state, local, and tribal crime and violence prevention would have been reduced to $2.9 billion by the President's budget request, a decrease of $1 billion from FY2006 enacted levels. Funding for the federal justice system under the President's request totaled $7.8 billion, which would have been an increase of $404 million over FY2006 appropriations. The House passed its SSJC bill ( H.R. 5672 ), which would have provided a total of $22.456 billion for the Department of Justice. This was $1.131 billion more than the Administration had requested and $741.7 million more than the enacted FY2006 funding level. The Senate-passed recommendation included $21.955 billion in DOJ funding, which would have been $461.3 million more than the President's request and $241.2 million more than enacted FY2006 levels. Under P.L. 110-5 , the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007, $22.692 billion was enacted for funding the Department of Justice, an increase of $977.9 million over FY2006 appropriations. (See Table 3 for more details.) General Administration The General Administration account for DOJ includes salaries and expenses, as well as other programs designed to ensure that the collaborative functions of the DOJ agencies are coordinated to help fight crime as efficiently as possible. Examples include the Joint Automated Booking System and the Automated Biometric Identification System. For FY2007, the President's budget proposal included $2.078 billion for General Administration, an increase of $233.9 million over FY2006 funding levels. The General Administration account funds the Attorney General's office, senior departmental management, the Inspector General's office, efforts to integrate fingerprint identification systems (e.g., IAFIS and IDENT), and narrowband communications, among other things. For FY2007, the budget request proposed funding of $175 million for the Justice Information Sharing Technology (JIST) initiative, $89.2 million for Narrowband Communications, and $1.332 billion for the Office of the Detention Trustee. For salaries and expenses, the President's FY2007 budget proposed $115.5 million, an increase of $7.4 million over FY2006 funding levels. These proposed funds would have supported the Attorney General and DOJ senior policy-level offices responsible for managing Department resources and developing policies for legal, law enforcement, and criminal justice activities. The FY2007 budget request did not include funding for the Office of Intelligence and Policy Review, which Congress had funded at $36.6 million in FY2006. The Administration's request for FY2007 proposed funding of $15.9 million for a National Drug Intelligence Center. The House-passed bill included $1.942 billion for General Administration funding, while the Senate recommendation included $1.859 million. The House bill would have allowed $35.4 million for Salaries and Expenses; the Senate recommendation would have provided $41.1 million. The House bill would have provided $125 million for JIST, while the Senate committee recommended $100 million in funding. For Narrowband Communications, the House bill would have provided $89 million, and the Senate recommended $75 million. For General Administration, the continuing resolution (CR), P.L. 110-5 , included $1,226 billion for General Administration funding. For the Federal Office of Detention Trustee (OFDT) , the FY2007 request included $1.332 billion in funding, a $170.4 million increase over FY2006 appropriations. The OFDT provides overall management and oversight for federal detention services relating to the detention of federal prisoners in non-federal institutions or otherwise in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. The House would have provided $1.331 billion for the Office of the Detention Trustee, while the Senate recommended $1.332 billion, an amount identical to the Administration's request. The CR included $1.255 billion for the Detention Trustee. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) is responsible for detecting and deterring waste, fraud, and abuse involving DOJ programs and personnel and promoting economy and efficiency in DOJ operations. The OIG also investigates allegations of departmental misconduct. The Administration's FY2007 budget proposal requested $70.558 million for the OIG, a $2.7 million increase over the FY2006 appropriation. The House and Senate proposals would have provided $70.558 million for FY2007. The CR for FY2007 included $70.118 million. U.S. Parole Commission The U.S. Parole Commission adjudicates parole requests for prisoners who are serving felony sentences under federal and District of Columbia code violations. For FY2007, the Administration's budget request proposed $11.951 million for the parole commission, an increase of $1.0 million over the FY2006 appropriation. The House and Senate proposals would have provided $11.5 million for the Parole Commission. The CR included $11.424 million for FY2007. Legal Activities The Legal Activities account includes several subaccounts: (1) general legal activities, (2) U.S. Attorneys, (3) U.S. Marshals Service, (4) prisoner detention, and (5) other legal activities. For FY2007, the Administration's budget request included $3.446 billion for legal activities, an increase of $168.7 million over the FY2006 enacted appropriations of $3.277 billion. The House bill included $3.385 billion, and the Senate recommended $3.384 billion for total legal activities. Under the CR, Legal Activities received FY2007 appropriations of $3.335 billion. The General Legal Activities account funds the Solicitor General's supervision of the department's conduct in proceedings before the Supreme Court. It also funds several departmental divisions (tax, criminal, civil, environment and natural resources, legal counsel, civil rights, and antitrust). For these purposes, the Administration's FY2007 budget request included $684.3 million, an increase of almost $30.8 million over the FY2006 enacted appropriation. The House bill included $668.7 million, and the Senate provided $653.4 million for these activities. The CR included $672.6 million for FY2007. The U.S. Attorneys and the U.S. Marshals Service are present in all of the 94 federal judicial districts. The U.S. Attorneys prosecute criminal cases and represent the federal government in civil actions. For the U.S. Attorneys Office, the Administration's FY2007 request included $1.664 billion, an increase of nearly $64.8 million over the enacted FY2006 amount of $1.599 billion. The House bill proposed $1.664 billion, the same amount as the Administration's request, while the Senate proposed $1.646 billion for funding of the U.S. Attorneys Office. The CR included $1.646 billion for the U.S. Attorneys in FY2007. The U.S. Marshals are responsible for the protection of the Federal Judiciary, protection of witnesses, execution of warrants and court orders, custody and transportation of unsentenced federal prisoners, and fugitive apprehension. The FY2007 request included $825.9 million for the Marshals Service, an increase of $25.3 million over the Service's FY2006 enacted appropriation of $801.7 million. The House bill proposed funding of $825.9 million, while the Senate proposed funding of $856.0 million for the U.S. Marshals. The CR included $814.8 million in FY2007 appropriations for the U.S. Marshals. For other legal activities \u2014the Community Relations Service, the Independent Counsel, the U.S. Trustee Fund (which is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the U.S. bankruptcy system by, among other things, prosecuting criminal bankruptcy violations), and the Asset Forfeiture program\u2014the FY2007 request included $298.2 million, $64 million more than appropriated in FY2006 of $234 million. The CR specified FY2007 funding of $10.178 million for Salaries and Expenses of the Community Relations Service, and $21.211 million for the Assets Forfeiture Fund out of total funding for other legal activities of $202.4 million. Interagency Law Enforcement The Interagency Law Enforcement account reimburses departmental agencies for their participation in the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program. Organized into nine regional task forces, this program combines the expertise of federal agencies with the efforts of state and local law enforcement to disrupt and dismantle major narcotics-trafficking and money-laundering organizations. From DOJ, the federal agencies that participate in OCDETF are the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Marshals Service; the Justice, Tax and Criminal Divisions of DOJ; and the U.S. Attorneys. From the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard participate in OCDETF. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Office of Enforcement also participate from the Department of the Treasury. State and local law enforcement agencies participate in approximately 87% of all OCDETF investigations. The FY2007 President's budget request included $706.1 million for OCDETF, of which $208 million was intended to be used for relocating the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs) at DOJ, for a net OCDETF funding level of $498.1 million. For FY2006, $483.2 million was appropriated for OCDETF, $14.9 million less than the net FY2007 amount requested by the Administration. The House bill proposed funding of $498.5 million for OCDETF in FY2007. The Senate recommended $388.0 million for the program. Neither the House nor Senate proposals included the relocation of HIDTAs from the Department of Treasury. The CR included OCDETF funding of $494.8 million for FY2007. Federal Bureau of Investigation The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as the lead federal investigative agency, continues to reorganize to focus more sharply on preventing terrorism and other criminal activities. The Administration's FY2007 request proposed funding of $6.04 billion for the FBI. This funding level would have increased FBI funding by $302.4 million over the FY2006 enacted appropriations of $5.738 billion. Of the President's requested amount, $51.4 million would fund construction. The FY2007 budget request included funding for the FBI to improve its ability to prevent terrorist attacks, disrupt terrorist and their financing, and investigate and prosecute those responsible for committing terrorist acts against the United States. The President's FY2007 budget would have provided funding of $2.308 billion for counterintelligence and national security, compared with appropriations of $2.260 billion in FY2006, a proposed increase of $48 million. The House bill provided total FBI funding of $6.043 billion, including $80.4 million for construction. The Senate recommended funding of $5.975 billion for the agency, of which $120.7 million would be for construction expenses. The CR included FBI total appropriations for FY2007 of $6.014 billion, of which $5.962 billion was specified for salaries and expenses, and $51.4 million was specified for construction. Drug Enforcement Administration The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is the lead federal agency tasked with reducing the illicit supply and abuse of dangerous narcotics and drugs. DEA, along with OCDETF, dismantled 119 drug trafficking organizations operating in the United States and significantly disrupted the activities of 208 others in FY2005. The Administration's FY2007 request included $1.736 billion for DEA, almost $61.6 million more than the $1.675 billion appropriated by Congress in FY2006. For FY2007, the House proposed funding of $1.752 billion for DEA, while the Senate proposed $1.724 billion. The CR included $1.737 billion for DEA funding in FY2007. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) enforces federal law related to the manufacture, importation, and distribution of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives. The FY2007 request proposed $860.1 million for ATF, a decrease of almost $71.7 million from FY2006 appropriations of $935.8 million. According to the FY2007 budget request, the Administration had proposed additional funding for ATF of $120 million to be collected from user fees related to explosives. The President's budget would have restructured and centralized a large portion of ATF's programmatic resources into the Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN) initiative. The PSN initiative brings together federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to identify the most pressing gun crime problems in their communities and develop strategies to attack those problems through prevention, deterrence, and aggressive prosecution. Under the PSN, a number of programs of several agencies, including OJP, ATF, the U.S. Attorneys, and the DOJ Criminal Division, would be coordinated to address the crime and violence in hard-hit neighborhoods across the country. For example, from OJP, the following programs would be brought into PSN: Project Childsafe , which distributes free gun safety kits; the State and Local Gun Crime Prosecution Assistance ( Project Sentry ) program, which provides support for prosecution of crimes involving misuse of firearms; the Gang Technical Assistance Program , a new program to assist states and localities in their efforts to disrupt criminal gang activity and enhance the sharing of criminal intelligence; the Weed and Seed program, which promotes multi-disciplinary community-based crime control strategies, including gang-related violence; the National Stalker and Domestic Violence Database , which supports law enforcement and prosecution efforts against stalking and domestic violence; and the National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) , which sponsors efforts to improve the quality, timeliness, and immediate availability of criminal history and related records used to support criminal investigations, and background checks for employment and eligibility to purchase a firearms. The Administration's FY2007 budget request proposed funding of $395 million for the PSN program. ATF also launched a companion initiative, the Violent Crime Impact Teams (VCIT), which combines the efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement to target gun crime \"hot spots.\" VCIT is currently active in 10 cities, and the FY2007 budget request included an expansion of the initiative to 15 additional cities. This expansion would have increased VCIT funding by $16 million, for a total request of $35.7 million. The House bill provided $950.1 million, and the Senate recommended $985.0 million for FY2007 funding for ATF. The CR included $979.2 million for ATF funding in FY2007. Federal Prison System The Federal Prison System is administered by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), which maintains penal institutions nationwide and contracts with state, local, and private concerns for additional detention space. The Administration requested almost $5.107 billion in FY2007 funding for the Federal Prison System, almost $173.2 million more than Congress appropriated for FY2006. The Administration estimates that as of January 26, 2006, there were nearly 188,463 federal inmates in 113 institutions, of which 11% represent immigration-related arrests and over 53% represent drug-related offenses. Of the total number of federal inmates, 159,872 are in facilities operated by the BOP. The BOP projects that the total federal prison population will increase to 195,972 in 2006, and increase to 203,880 by 2007. As required by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (VCCLEA) of 1994, the BOP provides substance abuse treatment for certain \"eligible\" inmates. According to BOP, over the past seven years, the percentage of all federal inmates with a substance abuse disorder increased from 34% to 40%. The House bill proposed funding of $5.079 billion for BOP, while the Senate recommended $5.303 billion for FY2007. The CR included FY2007 total funding for BOP of $5.407 billion, of which $4.974 billion was specified for salaries and expenses and $432.3 million for buildings and facilities. Office of Justice Programs The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) manages and coordinates the National Institute of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, Office of Victims of Crimes, Bureau of Justice Assistance, and related grant programs. For the Office of Justice Programs and related offices, bureaus, and programs, the Administration's request included $1.201 billion for FY2007, a reduction of more than $1.2 billion from FY2006 appropriated levels of just under $2.372 billion. For FY2007, the House bill provided $2.376 billion in total OJP funding, while the Senate proposed total funding of almost $1.934 billion for these programs. The CR included FY2007 funding for OJP programs of $2.479 billion. The President's FY2007 request proposed to eliminate funding for a number of OJP programs, similar to the President's FY2006 budget request, and consolidate the remaining programs under the Justice Assistance account. The following are selected examples of the President's budget-cutting proposals. The Administration's budget proposal would have eliminated funding for, among other programs, the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) program ($411.2 million in FY2006), the Byrne Discretionary Grants ($189.3 million in FY2006), Indian Country Prison Grants ($8.9 million in FY2006), and Tribal Court Grants ($7.9 million in FY2006). The President's proposal also would have eliminated funding for most Juvenile Justice programs, which had received appropriations in FY2006 of $338.4 million, including the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG), funded at $49.4 million. Funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), would have been eliminated by the President's budget proposal, compared with FY2006 funding of $399.8 million for the program, and the Secure Our Schools (SOS) program funding would have been eliminated, resulting in a $14.8 million reduction from FY2006 funding levels. The President's FY2007 budget request would have reduced funding for the Bulletproof Vests program from $29.6 million in FY2006 to $9.8 million in FY2007, and the Prison Rape Prevention and Prosecution Program, funded at just under $16 million in FY2006, would have been reduced to slightly under $2 million in FY2007. The President's FY2007 budget proposal would have increased funding for the Southwest Border Prosecution Initiative, from $29.617 million in FY2006 to $29.757 million in FY2007. The Weed and Seed Program/Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO) budget request would have decreased slightly, from $49.361 million in FY2006 to $49.348 million in FY2007. The National Stalker and Domestic Violence Database funding would have been increased, from $2.934 million in FY2006 to $2.938 in FY2007. The FY2007 budget request would have funded the Boys and Girls Clubs of America but at a reduced funding level of $59.5 in FY2007, compared to $83.9 million in FY2006. Both the House and Senate proposals would have funded most of the programs not funded under the Administration's FY2007 budget request. The House proposed funding of almost $635.1 million for JAG grants, while the Senate proposed $555.1 million for the program. The House bill would not have included any funding for the Byrne Discretionary Grants, while the Senate proposed funding of $120 million for FY2007. The House proposed funding of $49.3 million for the Weed and Seed program, while the Senate proposed $40 million for the program, an amount that would have reflected a $9.3 million reduction in program funding. The CR included $1.184 billion for law enforcement assistance, which included amounts for JAG grants as well as other grant programs for state, local, and tribal law enforcement. The CR did not specify the FY2007 funding amounts for many of the grant programs under OJP, although it did specify funding of $50.0 million for the Weed and Seed program. Community Oriented Policing Services The Administration's FY2007 request proposed $102.1 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program along with a rescission of $127.5 million, for a negative budget authority of $25.4 million. However, under the President's budget proposal some COPS programs would have been combined with other OJP programs and transferred into the Justice Assistance account (described below), to be awarded on a competitive basis. Funding for COPS Interoperability and Technology Grants would have been eliminated ($138.1 million in FY2006); the Meth Hot Spots program would have been funded at $40.1 million in FY2007, down from $62.7 million in FY2006; and the COPS Training and Technical Assistance program would have been funded at a slightly higher level, $3.997 million in FY2007, compared with $3.949 million in FY2006. In addition, beginning in FY2007, the Administration proposed that Indian Country activities be jointly administered by OJP and COPS, and included proposed funding of $31.1 million for tribal law enforcement. The House would have funded the COPS program at $541.7 million in FY2007, while the Senate would have provided funding of $537.6 million for the program. The House proposed $32 million for the Bullet Proof Vest initiative, while the Senate recommended $20 million for FY2007. The Meth Hot Spots program would have been funded at $99 million by the House proposal, while the Senate proposed funding of $85 million. COPS technology grants would have been funded at $100 million by the House and $110 million by the Senate. The CR included FY2007 funding for COPS of $541.7 million. The CR also included a rescission of up to $109 million in unobligated balances available from the prior year appropriation. Justice Assistance The Justice Assistance account funds the operations of OJP bureaus and offices. Besides funding OJP management and administration, this account also funds the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, cooperative efforts that address missing children, and regional criminal intelligence. For FY2007, the Administration's budget requested just under $1.098 billion. The House and Senate proposed total FY2007 funding for Justice Assistance of $223.6 million and $172 million, respectively. Under the CR, FY2007 funding for Justice Assistance received $237.7 million. The President's FY2007 budget proposed the realignment of most OJP grant programs under the Justice Assistance account, although Congress did not approve the Administration's proposal. Under the President's proposed realignment, selected OJP programs would have been used for the following purposes. Improving the Criminal Justice System. For Improving the Criminal Justice System, the Administration's request included $377.2 million along with a proposed $127.5 million rescission. The balance of the funds requested would include, among other programs, the following: $9.8 million for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership (formerly funded under COPS); $59.5 million for Boys and Girls Clubs; $165.8 million for the PSN program; $39.7 million for the Regional Information Sharing System; $29.8 million for the Southwest Border Project; $14.9 million for Faith-Based Prisoner Re-entry Initiative; and $1.9 million for Prison Rape Prevention & Prosecution. In addition, the Administration's FY2007 request proposed to eliminate funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance program (SCAAP). The House bill proposed funding of $32 million for the Bulletproof Vest program, while the Senate proposal recommended $20 million in FY2007 funding. The House bill would have included $75 million for Boys and Girls Clubs, while the Senate proposed funding of $85 million for the program. The House bill included funding of $415 million for SCAAP, while the Senate proposed funding of only $100 million for the program. For the PSN program, the House bill provided $54.8 million, and the Senate recommended $30 million. Research, Development, Evaluation, and Statistics. For Research, Development, Evaluation and Statistics, the Administration's FY2007 budget requested $116 million: $59.8 million for criminal justice statistics and $56.2 million for research, evaluation, and demonstration projects. Technology for Crime Identification. The Administration's FY2007 budget request for the Technology for Crime Identification program proposed $238.2 million in funding, of which $175.6 million for the DNA analysis and capacity enhancement program. Of that amount, not less than $151 million could be for reducing and eliminating the backlog of DNA samples and for increasing state and local DNA laboratory capacity. Both the House and Senate bills would have funded the DNA backlog grants at almost $175.6 million for FY2007, an increase of more than $68 million over FY2006 levels. Juvenile Delinquency and Crime. For strengthening the juvenile justice system, the Administration's FY2007 request included $175.9 million, including $93.2 for state and local programs under the Juvenile Justice Formula Grant program; $33.5 million for the Juvenile Delinquency Block Grants; $6.5 million for demonstration projects; and $10 million for research, evaluation, training and technical assistance. The President's FY2007 budget did not request funding for the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant. Juvenile Justice programs would have been funded at $285.7 million by the House and $300.2 million by the Senate. Both the House and Senate bills included $25 million in funding for the Juvenile Justice Formula Grant program and $6.6 million for discretionary grants. The House proposal provided $49.4 million for Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grants, while the Senate would provided $50 million. The CR provided funding of $326 million for FY2007 Juvenile Justice programs. Substance Abuse Demand Reduction. The Administration's FY2007 budget request for Substance Abuse Demand Reduction provided for funding of $79.9 million, including $69.2 million for Drug Courts, and $10.7 million for the Cannabis Eradication Grant program. The President's FY2007 budget request did not include funding for the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT), the drug treatment program for state prisoners. For Drug Courts, the House proposed $40 million in funding, compared to the Senate's recommendation of $15 million for the program. For the RSAT program, the House bill included $5 million and the Senate bill included $2 million. Neither bill included funding for the Cannabis Eradication grant program. Victims of Crime. The Administration's budget request for services for Victims of Crime (VOC) within the Justice Assistance account included $109.4 million. Among other things, this amount would have funded programs and initiatives authorized under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Victims of Child Abuse Act, including $50.9 million for the Missing Child program, just under $10 million for the Victim Notification System and for legal counsel and support services for victims, $11.7 million for improving the investigation and prosecution of child abuse, $1.9 million for the National Sex Offender Public Registry, and $1.5 million for victims of trafficking. In addition, the President's FY2007 budget request proposed a $625 million cap for the Crime Victims Fund. The budget request also included a proposal to rescind, or cancel, $1.255 billion from balances in the Crime Victims Fund, also frequently referred to as the \"Rainy Day\" fund. The House and Senate bills included provisions to set the Crime Victims Fund cap at $625 million for FY2007. The House and Senate bills did not include provisions to rescind the balance of the Crime Victims Fund. The Crime Victims Fund cap for FY2007 was $625 million, and the President's proposal to rescind the balance of the \"Rainy Day\" fund was not included in the CR. Office on Violence Against Women. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) was created in 1995 as a component of the Department of Justice, and the OVW is administratively separate from OJP. The Administration's FY2007 budget request for OVW would have provided funding of $347 million. Of that amount, $11.9 million would have been for the Court-Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program, $2.3 million for Child Abuse Training programs for judicial personnel and practitioners, and $986,000 for grants for televised testimony. For VAWA, the House bill included $418.3 million and the Senate report recommended $390 million. The CR provided $382.5 million for VAWA programs.

Commerce and Related Agencies6 Title II includes the appropriations for the Department of Commerce and related agencies. The origins of the department date to 1903 with the establishment of the Department of Commerce and Labor (32 Stat. 825). The separate Department of Commerce was established on March 4, 1913 (37 Stat. 7365; 15 U.S.C. 1501). The department's responsibilities are numerous and quite varied, but its activities center on five basic missions: (1) promoting the development of U.S. business and increasing foreign trade; (2) improving the nation's technological competitiveness; (3) encouraging economic development; (4) fostering environmental stewardship and assessment; and (5) compiling, analyzing, and disseminating statistical information on the U.S. economy and population. The following agencies within the Commerce Department carry out these missions: Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants for economic development projects in economically distressed communities and regions. Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) seeks to promote private and public sector investment in minority businesses. Bureau of the Census collects, compiles, and publishes a broad range of economic, demographic, and social data. Economic and Statistical Analysis Programs provide (1) timely information on the state of the economy through preparation, development, and interpretation of economic data and (2) analytical support to department officials in meeting their policy responsibilities. Much of the analysis is conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). International Trade Administration (ITA) seeks to develop the export potential of U.S. firms and to improve the trade performance of U.S. industry. Bureau of Industry and Security enforces U.S. export laws consistent with national security, foreign policy, and short-supply objectives (formerly the Bureau of Export Administration). National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides scientific, technical, and management expertise to (1) promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation; (2) assess the health of coastal and marine resources; (3) monitor and predict the coastal, ocean, and global environments (including weather forecasting); and (4) protect and manage the nation's coastal resources. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) examines and approves applications for patents for claimed inventions and registration of trademarks. Technology Administration , through the Office of Technology Policy, advocates integrated policies that seek to maximize the impact of technology on economic growth, conducts technology development and deployment programs, and disseminates technological information. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) assists industry in developing technology to improve product quality, modernize manufacturing processes, ensure product reliability, and facilitate rapid commercialization of products based on new scientific discoveries. National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) advises the President on domestic and international communications policy, manages the federal government's use of the radio frequency spectrum, and performs research in telecommunications sciences. The President's FY2007 budget request called for $6.18 billion for the Commerce Department. This represented a decrease of $293.8 million, or about 4.5%, from the FY2006 appropriation for the department of $6.47 billion (after the FY2006 rescission). The House bill, H.R. 5672 , would have cut the Department's appropriation further, to $5.77 billion, about 6% less than the current level and 10% less than the request. The principal reductions made by the House were in the accounts for NOAA, EDA, Census, and departmental management. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) enacted funding level for the Commerce Department for FY2007 was reported to be $6.53 billion. Departmental Management The President's FY2007 budget requested $98.5 million in new discretionary budget authority for Departmental Management: $57.0 million for salaries and expenses, $22.53 million for the Office of Inspector General (IG), and $18 million for renovation of the Department's headquarters, the Herbert C. Hoover Building. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) enacted funding level for the Departmental Management for FY2007 was reported to be $47 million for salaries and expenses and $22 million for IG. The President's FY2007 budget request of $57 million for salaries and expenses would have been approximately $9.5 million above the FY2006 appropriation, a 20% increase. The $22.53 million for the IG would have been a slight increase from the FY2006 appropriation of $22.47 million. The House bill provided $30.1 million for salaries and expenses, $26.9 million less than requested and $16.8 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. No funds were provided for renovation of the Hoover Building, but the House did grant the full $22.5 million for the IG. The Senate committee report's recommendation was that $52.1 million be provided for salaries and expenses. Included in this figure was $5.9 million for blast protection windows in the Hoover Building, but the Senate, like the House, provided nothing for Hoover Building renovation. With the $22.5 million for the IG, the Senate committee's allowance for the departmental management account amounts to $74.6 million, $22 million more than the House's allowance. International Trade Administration7 The International Trade Administration (ITA) provides export promotion services, works to assure compliance with trade agreements, administers trade remedies such as antidumping and countervailing duties, and provides analytical support for ongoing trade negotiations. The agency is divided into four policy units and an Executive and Administrative Directorate, with an estimated total full-time staff of 2,217 in FY2006. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) enacted funding level for ITA for FY2007 was reported to be $393.8 million, which is the same as the agency's budget in FY2006. The President's FY2007 request for ITA was $408.8 million, a $14.9 million (3.6%) increase over the FY2006 appropriation of $393.8 million (after rescissions). The request anticipated the collection of $33 million in fees and other reimbursable obligations, raising available funds to $441.8 million. The House recommended $429.8 million for ITA for FY2007, $28 million more than the current level and $8 million more than the request. Of the total, $13 million was to be offset from fee collections, for a net appropriation of $416.8 million. The House Appropriations Committee stated that the budget request was insufficient to fund overseas ongoing operations and provided an additional $3 million above the request to cover the costs of ongoing operations in overseas field offices. The Committee also recommended an additional $2 million for increased exports of environmental technologies. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a net appropriation of $413.8 million for ITA, $5 million above the budget request, but $3 million below the House recommendation. Manufacturing and Services Unit (MSU) The MSU carries out certain industry analysis functions of the former Trade Development Unit (TD), but it is also tasked with promoting the competitiveness and expansion of the U.S. manufacturing sector under the President's Manufacturing Initiative of March 2003. Congress transferred the trade promotion activities of TD\u2014the Advocacy Center, the Trade Information Center, and Office of Export Assistance\u2014to the new Trade Promotion Unit. The FY2006 appropriation provided $47 million for the MSU (before rescissions). The President requested $47.3 million in direct obligations for FY2007. The Senate recommendation for MSU for FY2007 was the same as the budget request. Market Access and Compliance Unit (MAC) The MAC monitors foreign country compliance with trade agreements, identifies compliance problems and market access obstacles, and informs U.S. firms of foreign business practices and opportunities. The FY2006 appropriation provided $43 million for MAC (before rescissions). The President requested $39.3 million in FY2007. The House recommendation for MAC was $40.8 million. The Senate recommendation for MAC was the same as the budget request. Import Administration Unit (IA) IA administers the trade remedy laws of the United States, including antidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard actions. In FY2006, IA received an appropriation of $59 million (before rescissions). The Administration has requested $59.4 million for IA in FY2007. The House recommendation for IA was $61.4 million. The Senate recommendation for IA in FY2007 was $59.4 million, the same as the budget request. Trade Promotion/U.S. Foreign Commercial Service (TP/FCS) The TP/FCS program conducts trade promotion programs intended to broaden and deepen the base of U.S. exports; provides U.S. companies with export assistance services; and leads interagency advocacy efforts for major overseas projects. In FY2006, the TP/FCS received an appropriation of $227 million (before rescissions). For FY2007, the Administration requested $237.3 million for this unit. The House recommendation for TP/FCS was $249.8 million. The Senate recommendation for TP/FCS was $242.3 million, $5 million above the budget request. Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) USTR, located in the Executive Office of the President (EOP), is responsible for developing and coordinating U.S. international trade and direct investment policies. The President's FY2007 request was $42.2 million, about $2 million less than the FY2006 amount of $44.2 million appropriated by Congress (including rescissions). The House approved $46.2 million for FY2007, $4 million (9%) more than requested by the President. The House recommended that $2 million of this amount was to be for negotiating, implementing, monitoring, and enforcing trade agreements with China. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation provided $42.2 million for USTR, the same as the Administration's request. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution enacted funding level for USTR for FY2007 was reported to be $44.2 million, which is the same as the agency's budget in FY2006. The USTR is responsible for advancing U.S. interests at the WTO and negotiating bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs). In 2006 and 2007, the Administration concluded FTAs with Oman, Peru, Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The Administration has ongoing negotiations with Thailand, Malaysia, and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Administration is participating in the ongoing multilateral negotiations known as the Doha Development Agenda. In 2006, USTR obtained congressional approval of FTAs with Bahrain, the Dominican Republic and Central American countries (DR-CAFTA), and Oman. The Office had 229 full-time employees in FY2006. U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) ITC is an independent, quasi-judicial agency that advises the President and Congress on the impact of U.S. foreign economic policies on U.S. industries and, along with the Import Administration Unit of ITA, is charged with administering various U.S. trade remedy laws. Its six commissioners are appointed by the President for nine-year terms. As a matter of policy, its budget request is submitted to Congress by the President without revision. In FY2006, ITC had 365 employees. For FY2007, ITC requested $64.2 million, about a $2 million increase over the $62.0 million appropriated by Congress in FY2006 (after rescissions). The House approved $62.6 million for FY2007, 1% more than the FY2006 level but 3% less than the budget request. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation provided $64.2 million for ITC, the same as the President's budget request. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution enacted funding level for ITC for FY2007 was reported to be $62.0 million, which is the same as the agency's budget in FY2006. Bureau of Industry and Security8 The President's FY2007 request for the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) was $78.6 million, a 3.4% increase from the funding level of $75 million (after rescissions) adopted by the FY2006 conference report ( H.Rept. 109-272 ). Under the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution ( P.L. 110-5 ), the FY2006 funding level was adopted for FY2007. BIS administers export controls on dual-use goods and technology through its licensing and enforcement functions. It cooperates with other nations on export control policy and provides assistance to the U.S. business community to comply with U.S. and multilateral export controls. It also administers U.S. anti-boycott statutes, and it is charged with monitoring the U.S. defense industrial base. The agency had 415 full-time employees in FY2006. Authorization for the activities of BIS, the Export Administration Act (50 U.S.C. 2401, et seq), last expired in August 2001. On August 17, 2001, President Bush invoked the authorities granted by the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) to continue in effect the system of controls contained in the act and by the Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R., Parts 730-799). BIS divided its FY2007 funding request between licensing activity ($38.9 million), enforcement activities ($33.2 million), and management and policy coordination ($6.5 million). Of these amounts, $14.8 million was requested for Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) enforcement. The House recommended $76.8 million, a level $1.8 billion above the current year, but the same amount below the administration request. Of the $76.8 million, the House recommended $62.0 million for operations and administration and $14.8 million for CWC compliance activities. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $78.6 million, the same as the President's request, and mirrored the division of funding above. Economic Development Administration9 For the second consecutive year, the Administration included in its budget request a proposal that would eliminate a number of federal economic and community development programs and dramatically reshape programs administered by the Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration (EDA). The Administration requested a total of $327.2 million for EDA activities for FY2007, including $257 million for the new Regional Development Account (RDA) program, $27 million for planning grants awarded to Economic Development Districts, $13 million for trade adjustment assistance, and $29 million for salaries and expenses. This was approximately $47 million more than the $280.4 million appropriated in FY2006, which included $29 million for salaries and expenses, $158 million for public works, $44 million for economic adjustment, $27 million for planning, $13 million for trade adjustment, $8 million for technical assistance, and $483,000 for research. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) enacted funding level for the Economic Development Administration for FY2007 was $280 million, which is the same as the agency's budget for FY2006. The Administration's FY2006 budget recommendations included a proposal that would have consolidated the activities of at least 18 existing community and economic development programs, including those of the EDA, into a two-part grant proposal called the Strengthening America's Communities Initiative (SACI). Responsibility for the18 programs now being carried out by five federal agencies (the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, Treasury, Health and Human Services, and Agriculture) would have been transferred to the Commerce Department. Congress eventually rejected the proposal and funded all 18 programs for FY2006. The Administration's FY2007 budget request outlined a revamped SACI proposal. Under the FY2007 version, two of the 18 programs would be funded\u2014the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program and a new Regional Development Account (RDA) within EDA. The FY2007 budget proposed a SACI funding level of $3.360 billion\u2014nearly $2 billion less than the aggregate appropriation for the 18 programs in FY2006. The Administration's FY2007 budget also identified some general elements of the new SACI proposal including development of a common set of goals and performance measures for the CDBG and RDA programs. In addition, the Administration plan called for a new CDBG allocation formula targeted to the neediest communities, a bonus fund component, and reforms that addressed the CDBG program's shortcomings outlined in the Program Assessment Rating Tool. On May 25, 2006, HUD posted its legislative reform on its website. The proposal did not have a House or Senate sponsor. The FY2007 version of the President's SACI proposal recommended consolidating four existing EDA programs (public works, economic adjustment assistance, research and evaluation, and technical assistance) into a single account, the RDA. RDA funds would be awarded on a competitive basis to entities that support multi-jurisdictional regional development activities. The Administration did not release a formal legislative proposal creating the RDA. H.R. 5672 , as passed by the House on June 29, 2006, recommended an FY2007 appropriation of $260.4 million for EDA activities, including $139.6 million for public works, $44.2 million for economic adjustment assistance, $8 million for technical assistance, $12.8 million for trade adjustment assistance, $26 million for planning grants and $29.7 million for salary and expenses. The proposed funding level was $20 million less than appropriated for FY2006 and recommended by the Senate, and $66.8 million less than the $327.1 million requested by the Administration. Under the House version of H.R. 5672 , funding for public works projects would fall $19 million below the $159 million appropriated in FY2006, accounting for the bulk of the reduction, accompanied by modest reductions in economic adjustment assistance ($600,000), trade adjustment assistance ($200,00) and technical assistance ($320,000). The committee report accompanying the bill included several directives to the EDA. The bill directed the EDA \"to continue operations and funding of the planning grant program for existing and designated economic districts in a manner that is consistent with the current and ongoing practices, policies and existing rules and regulations.\" This was a reference to questions generated by draft regulations released during August of last year. The report accompanying the bill also directed EDA to continue to direct funds to the most distressed communities, including providing funds to local economies affected by the economic downturn in the coal industry at no less than the same of level of assistance received in 2006, and it directed EDA to maintain the operation of all six of its regional offices. This last directive was in response to concerns that EDA was considering closing three of its six regional offices. On July 13, 2006, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of H.R. 5672 ( S.Rept. 109-280 ). The bill recommended an appropriation of $280.4 million for program activities and salaries and expenses. This is $47 million less than requested by the Administration, $20 million more than recommended by the House, and approximately the same amount as appropriated for FY2006. The bill included $155 million for pubic works, which is $15 million less than recommended by the House; $45 million for economic adjustment grants; $8.2 million for technical assistance; $15 million for trade adjustment assistance, which is $2.2 million more than recommended by the House; $26.7 million for planning grants; $870,000 for research grants; and $29.7 million for salaries and expenses. The report accompanying the Senate version of the bill included language that specifically rejected the Administration's request that program activities be consolidated into a single Regional Development Account. Like its House counterpart, the report accompanying the Senate version of the bill included language voicing concern about the distribution of EDA program funds among the agency's six regional offices. It directed EDA to allocate funds to the six regional offices within 30 days after enactment of the act using the EDA formula and to notify the Senate Appropriations Committee when all grant funds have been distributed. Minority Business Development Agency14 The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is charged with the lead role in coordinating all the federal government's minority business programs. For FY2007 the President's budget requests $29.6 million for the MBDA, which is unchanged from the enacted FY2006 appropriation. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House approved the full $29.6 million. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) enacted funding level for the Minority Business Development Agency for FY2007 is $30 million, which is the same as the agency's budget for FY2006. For FY2006, the Administration requested $30.7 million for the agency, and Congress approved $30.0 million. The FY2006 rescission reduced this by approximately $380,000, to $29.6 million. National Telecommunications and Information Administration15 The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is the executive branch's principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology issues and policies. Its mandate is to provide greater access for all Americans to telecommunications services; to support U.S. attempts to open foreign markets; to advise on international telecommunications negotiations; to fund research grants for new technologies and their applications; and to assist nonprofit organizations converting to digital transmission in the 21 st century. The NTIA also manages federal use of radio frequency spectrum domestically and internationally. For FY2007, the continuing resolution (CR) provided FY2006 funding levels for NTIA, like most other federal agencies. For FY2006, that total amount for NTIA was $39.6 million. There are two major components to the NTIA budget (the Bush Administration has sought to create a third program in its FY2008 budget request, created out of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, discussed below). The first is Salaries and Expenses. For FY2006, and through the CR of FY2007, this program received $17.8 million. In the past, a large part of this program has been for the management of various information and telecommunications policies both domestically and internationally. Currently, a large part of this program ($7 million) is for the management of the federal government's use of the radio spectrum. For the FY2008 budget, the Bush Administration requested $18.5 million for Salaries and Expenses. For the second component, the Public Telecommunications and Facilities Program (PTFPC), Congress continued to fund this program at FY2006 levels through FY2007, at $21.7 million. The Bush Administration sought to end funding for this program in its FY2008 budget request. The third NTIA program that the Bush Administration requested in both its FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests came out of the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. That law\u2014and the creation of the new NTIA program\u2014called for the creation of a Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund, which would offset receipts from the auction of licenses to use electromagnetic spectrum recovered from discontinued analog signals. The Bush Administration set those reimbursable funds at $45 million in FY2007. These receipts would fund the following programmatic functions at NTIA: a digital-analog converter box program to assist consumers in meeting the 2009 deadline for receiving television broadcasts in digital format; public safety interoperable communications grants (which would be made to ensure that public safety agencies have a standardized format for sharing voice and data signals on the radio spectrum); New York City's 9/11 digital transition funding (until the planned Freedom Tower is built); assistance to low-power television stations for converting from analog to digital transmission; a national alert and tsunami warning program; and funding to enhance a national alert system as stated in the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004. However, complete funding for all of these functions under the FY2007 CR has not been completely determined as of this date. National Technical Information Service16 In accordance with the National Technical Information Act ( P.L. 100-519 ), as amended in 1992 by the American Technology Preeminence Act ( P.L. 102-245 ), the President's budget submission did not request any funding for the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) for FY2007. Similarly, the House of Representatives did not appropriate any funding for NTIS when it passed H.R. 5672 on June 29, 2006. Likewise, the Senate Committee on Appropriations did not appropriate any funding for NTIS when it passed H.R. 5672 on July 13, 2006. The continuing resolution used to fund the remaining portion of FY2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) also did not include any funding for NTIS. Instead, funding for NTIS will continue to be drawn from NTIS' Revolving Fund, established by the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act for FY1993 ( P.L. 102-395 ). In part, due to NTIS's efforts to develop new products and limit spending, NTIS achieved a positive net income of $1.92 million for FY2006. This compares with a positive net income of $508,000 for FY2004, $10,000 for FY2003, $1.346 million for FY2002, and $2.290 million for FY2001. The NTIS is part of the Technology Administration at the Department of Commerce. The NTIS was established within the Department of Commerce in 1970, although its origins can be traced back to World War II with the creation of the Publications Board in 1945. The Publications Board collected classified scientific and technical information related to the war effort to be considered for release to the general public. These functions were formalized in 1950 with the establishment of the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information within the Bureau of Standards, which were later transferred to the newly created NTIS in 1970. According to its website, http://www.ntis.gov/ , NTIS serves as \"the federal government's central source for the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and related business information by or for the U.S. government and complementary materials from international sources.\" Its mission is to support \"the nation's economic growth and job creation by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery.\" The NTIS claims to hold approximately 3 million government information products, with 600,000 of these documents available through its online searchable database. In addition, NTIS offers a variety of fee-based services to federal agencies. These services include, but are not limited to, distribution of information products, support services, web development, multimedia production, and custom research services. The advent and rapid growth of electronic and multimedia publishing both challenges and affirms the role of NTIS. On the one hand, the growth of the Internet and electronic documents contributed, in part, to a decline in NTIS sales as more documents become available online at no charge from other sources. In addition, the emergence of a range of new information brokers raises the question of whether or not the services NTIS provides are redundant and/or directly compete with those provided by private sector companies. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of online content means that websites and their content can move location or disappear without notice. Moreover, even in the case of websites that are well established and relatively consistent in maintaining content, there is no guarantee that online materials will be archived or remain available indefinitely. In contrast, part of NTIS's responsibilities include maintaining a \"permanent repository\" of information. Bureau of the Census17 For discretionary domestic spending by the Bureau of the Census in FY2007, the Administration requested budget authority totaling $878.2 million: $184.1 million for salaries and expenses and $694.1 million for periodic programs, including the decennial census. The total request was $66 million greater than the FY2006 enacted amount of $812.2 million (and exceeded by $76.3 million the FY2006 level of $801.9 million, after rescissions). Much of the increase was due to preparations for the 2010 census, the Bureau's highest-priority program, which will involve a mail-out, mail-back short-form questionnaire to be answered by all U.S. households. The Bureau plans to replace the census long form with the American Community Survey (ACS), which provides yearly tabulations of data from monthly household samples. For the whole 2010 census program, the FY2007 request of $511.6 million was intended to go toward planning, testing, and developing the re-engineered census; improved mapping; and maintaining the full, nationwide ACS implementation level. To help fund the 2010 census, the Bureau proposed eliminating the Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey from the economic census. Also, the Bureau proposed phasing out and replacing the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), in the salaries and expenses account, as explained below. For the past two decades, the SIPP has been the leading source of [data on] the economic well-being of Americans. Its longitudinal household design provides many advantages; however, it also makes data processing and analysis difficult, leading to long delays before the data can be analyzed and understood. While the American Community Survey ... and a growing body of administrative records now provide important sources of information, they cannot by themselves meet all the information needs of policy makers. The FY2007 request includes $9.2 million to design a new data collection system on income and wealth dynamics to meet the policy and operational needs of the country, which will replace the SIPP. Of the $9.2 million, the Bureau was to use $5.6 million to design the new data collection system and the remaining $3.6 million \"to facilitate the collection of another wave (i.e., a ninth wave) of 2004 SIPP panel data during FY2007,\" thus providing a full 2006 calendar year of SIPP data. The ninth wave, however, would have depended on the Bureau's \"success in getting partner agencies (such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Social Security Administration) that rely on SIPP data to also make combined investments of roughly another $6.4 [million], allowing for a ninth wave investment of $10 [million].\" The House Appropriations Committee recommended that the SIPP survey receive $10 million more than the requested amount in discretionary funds \"to continue SIPP data collection while a new survey is designed\" and that an additional $10 million \"from mandatory funds ... be available to disseminate data collected from the SIPP in support of measuring the impact of welfare provisions.\" During consideration of H.R. 5672 , the House approved three amendments to shift $58.3 million from FY2007 Census Bureau funding to crime-fighting endeavors. Representative Mark Kennedy proposed moving $50 million from the Bureau to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program under the Department of Justice to combat, in particular, crimes associated with methamphetamine. The House agreed to the amendment by a 291-129 vote (Roll No. 330). Representative Ginny Brown-Waite offered an amendment, approved by voice vote, to take $5 million from the Department of Justice's general administration and another $5 million from the Census Bureau and increase funding for the Violence Against Women Act by $10 million. Also approved on a voice vote was Representative Nancy Johnson's amendment to decrease Bureau funding by $3.3 million and increase, by the same amount, funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Innocent Images Program, which seeks to protect children from online sexual predators. The House agreed to $825.9 million for the Census Bureau in FY2007, $24 million more than the FY2006 enacted amount, after rescissions. The amount approved for salaries and expenses was $190.1 million; that for periodic programs was $635.8 million. The $58.3 million funding shift discussed above would have had, according to the Bureau, effects such as eliminating group quarters data collection for the ACS. Without these data, \"the ACS cannot fully represent the total population of the U.S.,\" including prisoners and the elderly in nursing homes, and \"cannot fully be the replacement for the long form in 2010.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee's recommended $828.2 million for the Bureau in FY2007 exceeded the House amount by $2.3 million and the FY2006 enacted amount, after rescissions, by $26.3 million, but was $50 million less than the budget request. The shortfall was entirely in the periodic programs account, which was to receive $644.1 million instead of the requested $694.1 million. Salaries and expenses would have received $184.1 million, as requested. The committee report included language encouraging the Bureau \"to continue its hard work to minimize the number of personal visits for non-response follow-up for all census surveys.\" Increasing initial response rates would \"provide substantial cost savings in the ongoing American Community Survey, other periodic surveys, and the 2010 census.\" In P.L. 110-5 , Congress agreed to $696.4 million for periodic programs, including $511.6 million for the 2010 census, and $196.6 million for salaries and expenses, totaling $893 million for the Bureau in FY2007. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office24 The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventions and administers the registration of trademarks. It also assists other federal departments and agencies protect American intellectual property in the international marketplace. The USPTO is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as \"offsetting collections\" and subject to spending limits established by the Appropriations Committee. The President's FY2007 budget requested $1.843 billion in budget authority for the USPTO, an increase of 9.5% over the FY2006 figure. In addition, the budget document stated that the Office is to have \"full access\" to all fees collected in FY2007. The Administration also requested an extension of current law that temporarily increased patent fees for FY2005 and FY2006 and indicated that it will propose additional legislation to permanently extend this fee increase past FY2007. H.R. 5672 , the FY2007 Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act as passed by the House during the 109 th Congress, would have provided the USPTO with the budget authority to spend $1.771 billion in FY2007, 5% above the previous fiscal year. This was the same figure included in the bill reported from the Senate Committee on Appropriations in the 109 th Congress. The Senate committee report stated that The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] re-estimated the amount of fees the USPTO will collect in fiscal year 2007 downward from the administration's [sic] estimation of $1,842,966,000 to $1,771,000,000. The Committee is therefore required to treat the CBO re-estimation as the actual budget request. No final FY2007 appropriations bill was enacted during the 109 th Congress. The USPTO was funded through February 15, 2007, by a series of continuing resolutions. Passed by the 110 th Congress, P.L. 110-5 provided the Patent and Trademark Office with the budget authority to spend $1.771 billion in FY2007. The Administration's FY2006 budget proposal included $1.703 billion in budget authority for the USPTO. H.R. 2862 , as originally passed by both the House and the Senate, also provided $1.703 billion for the Office. The final FY2006 appropriations, P.L. 109-108 , gave the USPTO the budget authority to spend $1.683 billion, a lesser amount due to a revision of estimated fee collections by the USPTO itself. Beginning in 1990, appropriation measures have limited the ability of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to utilize the full amount of fees collected in each fiscal year. This is an area of controversy. Opponents of this approach argue that agency operations are supported by payments for services that must be financed in the year the expenses are incurred. Proponents of methods to limit USPTO fee usage maintain that the fees are necessary to help balance the budget and the fees appropriated back to the Office are sufficient to cover operating costs. Technology Administration/Office of the Under Secretary of Technology25 The Technology Administration and the Office of the Under Secretary of Technology in the Department of Commerce advocate national policies that foster technology development to stimulate economic growth, conduct technology development and deployment programs, and disseminate technological information. The Office of the Under Secretary for Technology also manages and supervises the activities of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Technical Information Service. For FY2007, the President's budget proposed spending $1.5 million for the Technology Administration, a decrease of 75% over the previous fiscal year. H.R. 5672 , as passed by the House in the 109 th Congress, provided $2.0 million for the Office of the Under Secretary of Technology, 66% below FY2006 funding. The version of H.R. 5672 reported from the Senate Committee on Appropriations during the 109 th Congress recommended financing of $2.5 million for the Office, 58% below the previous year's figure. No final FY2007 appropriations bill was enacted during the 109 th Congress. The Technology Administration was funded at FY2006 levels through February 15, 2007, by a series of continuing resolutions. The 110 th Congress passed P.L. 110-5 , which provided FY2007 appropriations of $2 million for the Office, a 66% decrease in support from FY2006. The Administration's FY2006 budget included $4.2 million for the Office of the Under Secretary for Technology. H.R. 2862 , as originally passed by the House, would have provided $6.5 million. The initial Senate-passed version of the bill included funding (but no specific amount) under the Departmental Management account. The final FY2006 appropriations, P.L. 109-108 , financed the Office at $5.9 million (after mandated rescissions). National Institute of Standards and Technology26 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a laboratory of the Department of Commerce. The organization's mandate is to increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies through appropriate support for industrial development of pre-competitive generic technologies and the diffusion of government-developed technological advances to users in all segments of the American economy. NIST research also provides the measurement, calibration, and quality assurance techniques that underpin U.S. commerce, technological progress, improved product reliability, manufacturing processes, and public safety. The Administration's FY2007 budget included $581.3 million for NIST, a decrease of almost 22.7% from the previous fiscal year. Support for the laboratory's internal R&D activities under the Scientific and Technology Research and Services (STRS) account would have increased 18.3% to $467 million (including $8 million for the Baldrige National Quality Program). No funding was requested for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and support for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) would decline 55.7% to $46.3 million. Construction financing would have totaled $68 million, a 60.8% decrease from FY2006. H.R. 5672 , the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act as passed by the House during the 109 th Congress, provided $627 million in FY2007 funding for NIST, almost 16.6% below the FY2006 figure due primarily to the absence of support for ATP. Financing for laboratory R&D in the STRS account would have increased 18.3% to $467 million. MEP funding totaled $92 million, 12% below the previous fiscal year. For the construction budget, $68 million was provided. The version of H.R. 5672 reported from the Senate Committee on Appropriations in the 109 th Congress would have funded NIST at $764 million, 1.6% above FY2006. Although there was no financing for ATP, there was increased support for internal laboratory R&D, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, and construction activities. The STRS account was to receive $467 million, the same amount included in both the Administration's request and the House-passed bill. Funding for MEP would have increased 1.3% from FY2006 to $106 million. Construction was to be financed at $191 million, 10% above the previous level and almost three times the amount provided by both the Administration's budget proposal and H.R. 5672 as passed by the House. No final FY2007 appropriations bill was enacted during the 109 th Congress; however, a series of continuing resolutions funded NIST at FY2006 levels through February 15, 2007. The 110 th Congress passed P.L. 110-5 , which appropriates $675 million for NIST in FY2007. Funding for the STRS account increases 9.6% to $432.8 million, construction support decreases 66% to $58.6 million, while other programs remain at FY2006 levels including $79 million for ATP and $104.6 million for MEP. The President's FY2006 budget requested $532 million in funding for NIST. Included in this figure was $426.3 million for the STRS account (with $5.7 million for the Quality Program). No support was provided for ATP, while MEP would have been funded at $46.8 million. The construction budget was to be $58.9 million. H.R. 2862 , as originally passed by the House, would have provided $548.7 million for NIST. The STRS account was to receive $397.7 million. Financing for MEP would total $106 million; no funding was provided for ATP. Construction activities would have received $45 million. The version of H.R. 2862 initially passed by the Senate funded NIST at $844.5 million. Included in this amount was $399.9 million for the STRS account (incorporating $7.2 million for the Quality Program), $106 million for MEP, and $140 million for ATP. The construction budget would total $198.6 million. Subsequently, the final FY2006 appropriations, P.L. 109-108 , provided $752 million for NIST (after the mandated rescissions but not including a $7 million rescission from unobligated balances in the MEP account). Support for the STRS account totaled $394.8 million and included $7.3 million for the Quality Program. The Manufacturing Extension Partnership received $104.6 million and the Advanced Technology Program was financed at $79 million. The construction budget totaled $173.6 million. Continued support for the Advanced Technology Program has been a major funding issue. ATP provides \"seed financing,\" matched by private sector investment, to businesses or consortia (including universities and government laboratories) for development of generic technologies that have broad applications across industries. Opponents of the program cite it as a prime example of \"corporate welfare,\" whereby the federal government invests in applied research activities that, they emphasize, should be conducted by the private sector. Others defend ATP, arguing that it assists businesses (and small manufacturers) in developing technologies that, while crucial to industrial competitiveness, would not or could not be developed by the private sector alone. Although Congress has maintained (often decreasing) funding for the Advanced Technology Program, the initial appropriation bills passed by the House since FY2002 failed to include financing for ATP. During the 109 th Congress, the version of the measure reported from the Senate Committee on Appropriations also did not fund ATP. For FY2006, support again was provided for the program, but the amount was 41% below that included in the FY2005 appropriations; FY2007 funding remained the same as the previous fiscal year. The budget for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, another extramural program administered by NIST, was an issue during the FY2004 appropriations deliberations. Although in the recent past congressional support for MEP remained constant, the Administration's FY2004 budget request, the initial House-passed bill, and the FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Act substantially decreased federal funding for this initiative, reflecting the President's recommendation that manufacturing extension centers \" ... with more than six years experience operate without federal contribution.\" However, P.L. 108-447 restored financing for MEP in FY2005 to the level that existed prior to the 63% reduction taken in FY2004. While the level of support decreased in FY2006, it remained significantly above the FY2004 figure; FY2007 funding remained at the same level. As part of the \"American Competitiveness Initiative,\" announced by the President in the 2006 State of the Union, the Administration has indicated that it intends to double over 10 years funding for \"innovation-enabling research\" performed at NIST. This is to be accomplished through increased support of NIST's \"core\" programs, defined as internal research in the STRS account and the construction budget. To this end, the President's FY2007 budget requested an 18.3% increase in funding for intramural R&D at the laboratory. P.L. 110-5 provided for approximately half this increase (9.6%) in support research performed within the NIST facilities. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)27 NOAA is the largest agency of the Department of Commerce (DOC) in terms of funding. For FY2007, NOAA's budget request was 58% of DOC's total request. President Bush requested almost $3.68 billion for NOAA for FY2007 (See Table 4 ), including $2.59 billion for the Operations, Research, and Facilities (ORF) account and $1.02 billion for the Procurement, Acquisition, and Construction (PAC) account. For NOAA's Other Accounts, which include the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF), the Coastal Zone Management Fund (CZMF), and NOAA's fisheries financing programs, $60.8 million was requested. Also requested was a transfer of $77 million from the Department of Agriculture for the Promote and Develop American Fisheries Fund (PDAFF), which provided additional spending authority. For FY2006, Congress had appropriated NOAA a total of $4.1 billion. About $3.94 billion of that was funded by the FY2006 Science, State, Justice and Commerce Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-108 ). The act included an across-the-board rescission of 0.28% for DOC (Title VI, Sect. 638), or about $40 million for NOAA. In February 2006, the Office of Management and Budget proposed a 1% across-the-board discretionary spending cut for most federal agencies. Section 3801 of the FY2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Act ( P.L. 109-148 ) implemented the rescission resulting in a net appropriation for NOAA of $3.91 billion ( Table 4 .) P.L. 109-148 also provided NOAA $54 million in emergency appropriations for Hurricane Katrina recovery ( H.Rept. 109-359 , December 18, 2005, pp. 97-98), which increasing NOAA's FY2006 appropriations to almost $3.95 billion. On February 16, 2006, the President requested further emergency appropriations of $33 million for NOAA. Instead, Congress approved $150 million in P.L. 109-234 , resulting in a grand total of $4.1 billion in appropriations for FY2006. The President's Budget President Bush's FY2007 budget request for NOAA of $3.68 billion was $420 million, or 10.2%, less than the $4.1 billion appropriated for FY2006. Increases were proposed for the National Weather Service (NWS) and for NOAA Satellite programs. This would have included $104.0 million for the Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite (GOES) program to develop next generation GOES-R satellites. Also, $20.3 million (to be matched by DOD) was requested for the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) because of launch and deployment scheduling slippages. The President requested $12.4 million for NWS for FY2007 to procure the last 19 tsunami detection buoys deployed as part of a \"strengthened\" National Tsunami Warning Program that included technology upgrades and warning system expansion. NOAA's Administrator noted that the request would culminate a $40 million commitment. The President also requested that $25 million of unobligated FY2005 funds that were rescinded by Congress in FY2006 be restored. He also proposed savings of $590 million for FY2007 by terminating funding for certain NOAA programs, including $573 million from funding added by Congress in FY2006 not requested by the Administration, and $16.3 million from one-year-only construction projects completed. Among the more vocal critics of the President's FY2007 budget, Joint Oceans Commission (JOC) leaders objected to funding cuts proposed for ocean and coastal research-related budgets. Issues debated during deliberations on NOAA's FY2007 appropriation included NOAA's satellite budget and the dissatisfaction of some Members of Congress with management of the polar satellite program and associated ground-based satellite data management components. Some constituents asserted that NOAA funding requested by the President and appropriated by the House for FY2007 was not sufficient to implement recommendations of the Joint Ocean Commissions Initiative (JOCI) in support of ocean research and exploration activities. The House Committee on Science reported H.R. 5450 (amended by H.Rept. 109-545 , Part I), legislation to fund all of NOAA programs under a single authorizing law, and on September 20, 2006, the House passed the measure by voice vote. The Senate received H.R. 5450 on September 21, 2006, and referred it to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. No further legislative action occurred. P.L. 110-5, Continuing Resolution for FY2007 On February 15, 2007, President Bush signed H.J.Res. 20 into law as P.L. 110-5 , the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007. The act provided almost $3.98 billion for NOAA for FY2007 ( Table 4 ). Chapter 9 of P.L. 110-5 , Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies, provided additional budget authority for NOAA, but also required funding cuts. This had the net effect of increasing NOAA appropriations by about $26 million above FY2006 levels. Budget authority for certain loan guarantees under the Fisheries Financing account were reduced by $21 million. The FY2007 appropriation was $298 million, or about 8%, more than the FY2007 request of $3.68 billion. (For more information on NOAA's budget, see CRS Report RS22614, The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): A Review of the FY2008 Budget and Congressional Appropriations , by [author name scrubbed].) Related Legislation H.J.Res. 53 (Miller-MI) Proposes to amend the U.S. Constitution to provide for apportioning the House of Representatives on the basis of the number of U.S. citizens, not persons, in each state. If the amendment went into effect, the decennial census short form would have to include a question about citizenship. Introduced June 9, 2005, and referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 5450 (Ehlers) This legislation was introduced on May 22, 2006, and was referred to the House Committees on Science and Resources. The House Science Committee reported it on June 29, 2006 ( H.Rept. 109-545 , Part 1). It establishes the NOAA within the Department of Commerce, maintaining the current leadership structure at NOAA, but creates a new Deputy Assistant Secretary for Science and Education. It requires the Secretary of Commerce to maintain the National Weather Service within NOAA. It describes programs to support the operations and services, and the research and education functions of NOAA and authorizes the NOAA Science Advisory Board. It requires NOAA to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to perform three tasks, including an assessment of the adequacy of the environmental data and information systems of NOAA and to flesh out two strategic plans dealing with information system adequacy and extramural research to support the mission of NOAA. It also requires NOAA to submit a reorganization plan to Congress 18 months after enactment of the legislation. It repeals the executive order that established NOAA in 1970 and preserves the status of all current NOAA rules, regulations, and other legal matters. It requires NOAA to notify Congress and the public before closing or transferring a NOAA facility. Finally, the legislation establishes conditions for development of major program cost baselines and requires notification to Congress when certain cost increases or schedule delays occur in major programs. H.R. 337 (Maloney) Would amend present law to make the term of office of the Director of the Census five years and require that he or she report directly to the Secretary of Commerce. Introduced January 25, 2005, and referred to the House Committee on Government Reform. Related CRS Products CRS Report 95-36, The Advanced Technology Program , by [author name scrubbed].

Science Agencies National Aeronautics and Space Administration31 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act (P.L. 85-568) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. The agency is managed from headquarters in Washington, DC. It has nine major field centers around the country, plus the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated under contract by the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Michael Griffin became NASA Administrator in April 2005. NASA requested $16.792 billion for FY2007, a 1% increase over its FY2006 appropriation of $16.631 billion. If $385 million in supplemental funding for Hurricane Katrina response and recovery was excluded from the FY2006 figure, the requested increase for FY2007 was 3%. For FY2007 the House provided $16.709 billion in H.R. 5672 . The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $16.757 billion plus an additional $1.040 billion in emergency funding. The final continuing resolution ( P.L. 110-5 ) provided $16.247 billion, plus an unspecified amount for statutory increases in civil servant pay (Sec. 111). In September 2006, NASA announced a change in how it accounts for overhead expenses. The new system is known as \"full cost simplification.\" The change increases the stated cost of some programs and decreases the stated cost of others, without affecting actual program content. The increases and decreases exactly balance, so that NASA's total budget was unchanged. For any particular program, however, amounts expressed in the new accounting system were not directly comparable with amounts expressed in the previous system. In particular, amounts in the final FY2007 appropriation may not be directly comparable with amounts in the FY2007 request. NASA's initial operating plan for FY2007 would likely have clarified such comparisons, but it had not yet been made public. For more details, see CRS Report RS22381, cited at the end of this section. Budget priorities throughout NASA are being driven by the Vision for Space Exploration, announced by President Bush in January 2004 and endorsed by Congress in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-155 ). The Vision includes returning the space shuttle to flight status, then retiring it by 2010; completing the space station, but discontinuing its use by the United States by 2017; returning humans to the moon by 2020; and then sending humans to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" The President did not propose significantly increased funding for NASA to accomplish the Vision. Instead, most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other NASA activities. (Dr. Griffin has described this approach as \"go as you can afford to pay.\") The funding requirements of the Vision thus constrain other NASA priorities. In the Science, Aeronautics, and Exploration (SA&E) account, funding for Constellation Systems, the program responsible for developing vehicles to return humans to the moon, would have increased from $1.7 billion in FY2006 to $3.1 billion in the FY2007 request. The House provided $150 million less than the request for Exploration Systems, which consists of Constellation Systems and two smaller programs. The Senate committee also recommended less than the request for Exploration Systems. The final appropriation for Exploration Systems was $578 million less than the request, but the act was silent on how reductions should be allocated among Constellation Systems and the other programs. Meanwhile, also in SA&E, reduced growth in Science funding would have added up to a proposed reduction of $3.1 billion through FY2010 relative to projections in the previous year's request. Most of that reduction would have been to offset higher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the February 2003 Columbia accident. The request for Science included full funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, but funding for several robotic missions to Mars were cancelled or deferred. No funding was requested for the SOFIA airborne infrared telescope or the Europa mission to one of Jupiter's moons. The request for Research and Analysis, which provides grant funding to individual researchers, was down 15% from FY2006 in most programs. The House provided $75 million more than the request for Science, including $50 million for Research and Analysis. The Senate committee recommended increases totaling $31.5 million for two Science programs and directed NASA to proceed with SOFIA \"from within available funds.\" The final appropriation, however, was $5.251 billion, less than the request by $79 million. The request for Aeronautics Research in SA&E was about the same as was projected the previous year, but its content had changed significantly. The largest program, Vehicle Systems, has been renamed Fundamental Aeronautics and now focuses on \"core competencies\" in subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight regimes, including work on rotorcraft. In the FY2006 budget cycle, proposals to eliminate several of these areas met with strong congressional opposition. An amendment to the Senate FY2007 budget resolution ( S.Amdt. 3033 to S.Con.Res. 83 ) increased the recommended funding for NASA aeronautics by $179 million. The House provided $100 million more than the request for Aeronautics Research. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $35 million more than the request. The final appropriation provided $890 million for aeronautics, more than the request by $166 million. In the Exploration Capabilities account, NASA's current human space flight programs, the space shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS), are also being significantly affected by the Vision. The President's speech directed that the space shuttle be retired in 2010 after ISS construction is completed. The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) being developed by the Constellation Systems program, whose primary purpose is to take astronauts to the moon, would also be able to visit the ISS. However, because it is planned for \"no later than 2014\" there is likely to be a multi-year gap when the United States will be unable to launch its own astronauts into space. As for the ISS, the President's speech directed NASA to restructure the broad-based research program it had planned to conduct aboard ISS to support only research needed to accomplish the Vision. (Congress responded in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 by directing that at least 15% of ISS research funding be used for research not related to the Vision.) It is unclear what will happen to the ISS after its use by NASA is completed in 2017. The House provided the requested amount for the space shuttle but less than the request for the ISS and other Exploration Capabilities activities. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount for Exploration Capabilities. The final appropriation for Exploration Capabilities was $6.140 billion, less than the request by $94 million. A Mikulski amendment in the full Senate Appropriations Committee markup created two new appropriations accounts for NASA: $1 billion for space shuttle Return to Flight expenses and $40 million for additional Hurricane Katrina recovery expenses. Both were designated as emergency funding. Neither was included in the request, the House bill, or the final appropriation.

National Science Foundation (NSF)32 Agency Mission The National Science Foundation (NSF) was created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (P.L. 81-507). The NSF has the broad mission of supporting science and engineering in general and funding basic research across many disciplines. The majority of the research supported by the NSF is conducted at U.S. colleges and universities. In addition to helping to ensure the nation's supply of scientific and engineering personnel, the NSF promotes academic basic research and science and engineering education across many disciplines. Other federal agencies, in contrast, support mission-specific research. The NSF provides support for investigator-initiated, merit-reviewed, competitively selected awards, state-of-the-art tools, and instrumentation and facilities. Also, NSF provides almost 30% of the total federal support for science and mathematics education. Support is provided to academic institutions, industrial laboratories, private research firms, and major research facilities and centers. Although the NSF does not operate any laboratories, it does support Antarctic research stations, selected oceanographic vessels, and national research centers. In addition, the NSF supports university-industry relationships and U.S. participation in international scientific ventures. The NSF is an independent agency in the executive branch and under the leadership of a presidentially appointed Director and a National Science Board (NSB) composed of 24 scientists, engineers, and university and industry officials involved in research and education. The NSB and the Director make policy for the NSF. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the NSF has the responsibility of, among other things, conducting audits and investigations of NSF programs, and promoting efficiency and effectiveness in NSF programs and operations. The OIG reports directly to the NSB and Congress. Key Budget Issues Overview of the FY2007 Appropriation The FY2007 appropriation for the National Science Foundation (NSF) was included in P.L. 110-5 , H.J.Res. 20 , Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007. NSF is funded at $5.92 billion in FY2007, approximately $336 million (6%) above the FY2006 level of $5.58 billion. (The continuing resolution provided increased funding for the Research and Related Account (R&RA) for FY2007. All other accounts in NSF were maintained at approximately the same level as FY2006). The President's American Competitiveness Initiative proposes to double the NSF budget over the next 10 years. The FY2007 appropriation was to be the first installment toward that doubling effort. The FY2007 appropriation for NSF provided support for several interdependent priority areas: broadening participation in the science and engineering enterprise, providing world-class facilities and infrastructure, advancing research at the frontier, and bolstering K-12 education. NSF will invest more than $600 million in programs targeted at those groups underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce. Funding has been provided for the construction of world-class facilities and for activities at advancing research at the frontiers of science. NSF asserts that international research partnerships are critical to the nation in maintaining a competitive edge, addressing global issues, and capitalizing on global economic opportunities. To address these particular needs, the FY2007 appropriation provided increased funding for the Office of International Science and Engineering. Also, in FY2007, NSF will continue in its leadership role in planning U.S. participation in observance of the International Polar Year, which spans 2007 and 2008. A first-year investment was provided to address major challenges in polar research. Other FY2007 highlights include funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, investments in Climate Change Science Program, continued support for homeland security, and funding for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development. Also, a new effort in the FY2007 appropriation was support for a program of fundamental research on new technologies for sensor systems that detect explosives. The FY2007 appropriation included $4.67 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), a 7.7% increase ($334.5million) over the FY2006 level of $4.33 billion. R&RA funds research projects, research facilities, and education and training activities. Partly in response to concerns in the scientific community about the imbalance between support for the life sciences and the physical sciences, the FY2007 appropriation provided increased funding for the physical sciences. Research in the physical sciences often leads to advances in other disciplines. R&RA includes Integrative Activities (IA) and is a source of funding for the acquisition and development of research instrumentation at U.S. colleges and universities. It also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA. In FY2006, responsibility for funding the costs of icebreakers that support scientific research in polar regions was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to NSF. The NSF will continue to operate and maintain the three icebreakers. The OPP is funded at $485 million in the FY2007 appropriation, 24.2% above the FY2006 level. Significant increases in OPP for FY2007 are directed at the programs for Arctic and Antarctic sciences. Funding levels for other programs and activities in the R&RA resulting from the CR are not yet available. Research project support in the FY2007 appropriation totals approximately $2.40 billion. Support is provided to individuals and small groups conducting disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research. NSF supports a variety of individual centers and center programs. The FY2007 appropriation provided funding for Science and Technology Centers, Materials Centers, Engineering Research Centers, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, and Centers for Analysis and Synthesis. The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account was funded at the CR level of $190.9 million in FY2007, the same as FY2006. The MREFC supports the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment that extend the boundaries of science, engineering, and technology. Of all federal agencies, NSF is the primary supporter of \"forefront instrumentation and facilities for the academic research and education communities.\" First priority for funding is directed at ongoing projects. Second priority is given to projects that have been approved by the National Science Board (NSB) for new starts. NSF requires that for a project to receive support, it must have \"the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding and/or infrastructure technology.\" NSF states that the projects receiving support in the FY2007 appropriation meet that qualification. Six ongoing projects and two new starts are funded in FY2007. Projects receiving support are the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Construction ($64.3 million), EarthScope ($27.4 million), IceCube Neutrino Observatory ($28.7 million), National Ecological Observatory Network ($4 million), Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel ($42.9 million), Alaskan Region Research Vessel ($9.4 million), and Ocean Observatories Initiative ($5.1 million). An additional $9.1 million was provided for the South Pole Station Modernization project. The FY2007 appropriation provided support for several NSF-wide investments: biocomplexity in the environment, human and social dynamics, and mathematical sciences. Additional priority areas include those of strengthening core disciplinary research, continuing as lead federal agency in networking and information technology R&D, and sustaining organizational excellence in NSF management practices. The NSF maintains that researchers need not only access to cutting-edge tools to pursue the increasing complexity of research, but funding to develop and design the tools critical to 21 st century research and education. A proposed investment of $596.8 million in cyberinfrastructure will allow for funding of modeling, simulation, visualization and data storage, and other communications breakthroughs. NSF anticipates that this level of funding will make cyberinfrastructure more powerful, stable, and accessible to researchers and educators through widely shared research facilities. Increasing grant size and duration has been a long-term priority for NSF. The funding rate for research grant applications has declined from approximately 30% in the late 1990s to an estimated 23% in FY2006. The FY2007 appropriation for the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) was $796.7 million, the same level as FY2006. (Disaggregated data on funding of specific programs and activities in the EHR, as a result of the CR, are not yet available). The EHR portfolio is focused on, among other things, increasing the technological literacy of all citizens, preparing the next generation of science, engineering, and mathematics professionals, and closing the achievement gap in all scientific fields. Support is provided at the various educational levels: pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate. Priorities at the pre-college level include research and evaluation on education in science and engineering, informal science education, and a new program, Discovery Research K-12. Discovery Research will combine the strengths of three existing programs and encourage innovative thinking in K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. At the undergraduate level, approximately 72% of the funding was in support of new awards and activities. Priorities at the undergraduate level include the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program; Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Talent Expansion Program; the National STEM Education Digital Library; the Federal Cyber Service; and Advanced Technological Education. The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP) has been transferred to the undergraduate level in FY2007. The MSP has made approximately 80 awards, with an overall funding rate of about 9%. No new partnerships have been proposed in FY2007. Funding in the FY2007 appropriation will provide support for ongoing awards, in addition to data collection, evaluation, knowledge management, and dissemination. At the graduate level, priorities are those of Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, Graduate Research Fellowships, and the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education. Added support was given to several programs directed at increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in science, mathematics, and engineering. The FY2007 budget had requested the following amounts for theses programs: Historically Black Colleges and Universities Programs ($29.7 million), Tribal Colleges and Universities Program ($12.4 million), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation ($39.7 million), and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology ($24.9 million). As previously stated, the CR maintained FY2007 funding for the EHR at the FY2006 level, ($19.3 million less than the request), and it has not been determined as yet what the \"revised\" funding levels are for any of the science education programs. Policy Issues There has been considerable debate in the academic and scientific community and in Congress about the management and oversight of major projects selected for construction and the need for prioritization of potential projects funded in the MREFC account. The NSF was directed to improve its oversight of large projects by developing an implementation plan that included comprehensive guidelines and project oversight review. One continuing question focused on the selection process for including major projects in the upcoming budget cycle. In February 2004, the National Academies released the congressionally mandated study of the process for prioritization and oversight of projects in the MREFC account. The report recommended a more open process for project selection, broadened participation from various disciplines, and well-defined criteria for the selection process. In September 2005, the NSB released its management report on the new guidelines for the development, review, and approval of major projects: Setting Priorities for Large Research Facility Projects Supported by the National Science Foundation . The report describes facilities under construction and those being considered for future funding. Because of the changing nature of science and technology, NSF deems it essential that it have the flexibility to reconsider facilities at the various stages in their development. Also, the NSF states that it must be able to respond effectively to possible changes in interagency participation, international and cooperative agreements, or co-funding for major research facilities. The NSF encourages project planning from disciplines and fields in which scientists and engineers have not traditionally partnered or collaborated. The report notes that although some \"concepts\" may evolve into MREFC candidates, others may prove infeasible for major project support. The NSF has stated that the facility plan will be updated as needed. In September 2006, the NSF released the report, Investing in America ' s Future\u2014Strategic Plan FY2006-2011 . NSF states that the report addresses the accelerating pace of scientific discoveries that are occurring in a more competitive international environment. The Strategic Plan lists several investment priorities that are targeted for increased emphasis of funding over the next five years. The investments include furthering U.S. economic competitiveness; promoting transformational, multidisciplinary research; improving k-12 teaching and learning in science and mathematics; developing a comprehensive, integrated cyberinfrastructure; and strengthening the nation's collaborative advantage through unique networks and innovative partnerships. In addition, NSF will continue to improve management excellence, with a focus on joining such areas as resource allocation, communication strategies, award management and oversight, and the core processes of merit review.

Department of State and International Broadcasting38 Background The State Department, established on July 27, 1789 (1 Stat.28; 22 U.S.C. 2651), has a mission to advance and protect the worldwide interests of the United States and its citizens. The State Department supports the activities of more than 50 U.S. agencies and organizations operating at 260 posts in 180 countries. Currently, the State Department employs approximately 30,000 people, about 60% of whom work overseas. As covered in Title IV of the House Science, State, Justice, and Commerce (SSJC) appropriations measure, State Department funding categories include administration of foreign affairs, international operations, international commissions, and related appropriations, such as international broadcasting. The enacted FY2006 appropriation for Title IV was $9.56 billion (after adjusting for two rescissions), 9.4% higher than the previous year's regular appropriation, but 11% lower than the previous appropriations when including the FY2005 supplemental funds within P.L. 109-13 for Title IV. Typically, about three-fourths of State's budget is for Administration of Foreign Affairs (about 69% in FY2006), which consists of salaries and expenses, diplomatic security, diplomatic and consular programs, technology, and security/maintenance of overseas buildings. FY2007 Funding Issues39 Administration of Foreign Affairs The Administration's FY2007 request for State's Administration of Foreign Affairs (including mandatory funding of $125 million for Foreign Service Retirement) was $6.93 billion, 5.5% above the FY2006 estimated level of $6.57 billion (including rescissions). The House-passed level in H.R. 5672 was $6.66 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee funding level in H.R. 5522 was $6.58 billion. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) provided $6.50 billion for Administration of Foreign Affairs for FY2007. Diplomatic & Consular Programs (D&CP) D&CP covers primarily salaries and expenses, hiring, diplomatic expenditures, cost of living and foreign inflation, as well as exchange rate changes. The FY2007 request of $4.65 billion represented an increase of 7.7%, compared with the $4.32 billion funding level enacted for FY2006. The FY2007 funding level request included $795.2 million for worldwide security upgrades, compared with $680.7 million in the FY2006 appropriation. The D&CP funding request also included $351 million, compared with $329.7 million in the FY2006 budget, designated only for public diplomacy. The House-passed funding for D&CP was $4.46 billion, including $351 million for public diplomacy and $795.2 million for worldwide security upgrades. The Senate Appropriations Committee set funding at $4.50 billion, including $795.2 million for worldwide security upgrades. The enacted level for FY2007 was $4.31 billion, including $766 million for worldwide security upgrades. Embassy, Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) ESCM provides funding for embassy construction, repairs, and leasing of property for embassies and housing facilities at overseas posts. The FY2007 request of $640.1 million was 12.1% above the FY2006 enacted level of $571.1 million (including rescissions). The House agreed to a total of $1.51 billion for ESCM, including $605.7 million for regular funding and $899.4 million for worldwide security upgrades. The Senate committee recommended funding for ESCM to be a total of $1.38 billion and did not designate how much the Department should spend on regular versus worldwide security upgrades overall. The continuing resolution provided $595.0 million for regular ESCM funding and $897.0 million for worldwide security upgrades for a total of $1.49 billion in FY2007. Worldwide Security Upgrades Ever since the bombings of two U.S. embassies in eastern Africa in August 1998, Congress has appropriated additional money within both D&CP and ESCM for increasing security. The funds in D&CP for worldwide security upgrades are primarily for ongoing expenses due to the upgrades that took place after 1998, such as maintaining computer security and bullet-proof vehicles, and ongoing salaries for perimeter guards. Worldwide security upgrades in ESCM are more on the order of bricks-and-mortar-type expenses. The FY2007 request for upgrades within D&CP totaled $795.2 million\u2014$114.5 million (16.8%) above the enacted level of $680.7 million (reflecting rescissions) for FY2006. The FY2007 request for worldwide security funding within ESCM totaled $899.4 million, virtually the same as the FY2006 level (after rescissions). The combined total FY2007 request for State's worldwide security upgrades was $1.69 billion. The combined enacted funding for worldwide security upgrades totaled $1.66 billion for FY2007. Educational and Cultural Exchanges This line item includes programs such as the Fulbright, Muskie, and Humphrey academic exchanges, as well as the international visitor exchanges and some Freedom Support Act and SEED programs. The Administration's FY2007 request was for $474.3 million, 11.3% more than the FY2006 estimated level of $426.3 million. The Administration request included $200.3 million for the Fulbright program and $351 million within the D&CP account for public diplomacy expenses. The House-passed funding level was $436.3 million, while the Senate committee level was $445.5 million. The continuing resolution ( P.L. 110-5 ) provided $445.3 million for exchanges in FY2007. Capital Investment Fund (CIF) CIF was established by the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of FY1994/95 ( P.L. 103-236 ) to provide for purchasing information technology and capital equipment that would ensure the efficient management, coordination, operation, and utilization of State's resources. The FY2007 request was for $68.3 million, a 17.6% increase over the $58.1 million enacted for FY2006 (after rescissions). In addition, the FY2006 appropriation included $68.5 million for the Centralized Information Technology Modernization Program. The Administration did not request any funding for that account for either FY2006 or FY2007. The House agreed to $58.1 million for CIF, and the Senate committee recommended the same amount. The enacted FY2007 level was $58.1 million for CIF. International Organizations and Conferences The International Organizations and Conferences account consists of two line items: U.S. Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) and U.S. Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA). The FY2007 request totaled $2.40 billion for the overall account, up nearly 11% over the FY2006 level of $2.17 billion, including rescissions. Contributions to International Organizations (CIO) The CIO supports U.S. membership in numerous international and multilateral organizations that transcends bilateral relationships and covers issues such as human rights, environment, trade, and security. The FY2007 request level for this line item was $1.27 billion, 10.2% above the $1.15 billion enacted level for FY2006. The request represented full funding of U.S. assessed contributions to the U.N. and other international organizations. It did not include funding for prior-year funding shortfalls. The House-passed bill provided $1.12 billion, while the Senate committee recommendation was $1.15 billion for CIO in FY2007. The continuing resolution enacted the FY2006 level of funding ($1.15 billion) for FY2007. Contributions to International Peacekeeping (CIPA) The United States supports multilateral peacekeeping efforts around the world through payment of its share of the U.N. assessed peacekeeping budget. The President's FY2007 request of $1.14 billion represented an increase of 11.1% over the FY2006 estimated level of $1.02 billion (including rescissions). In addition, the Administration requested an additional $69.8 million for this account to support U.N. peacekeeping efforts in the southern Sudan. The House-passed bill set funding at $1.14 billion, as did the Senate Appropriations Committee. The enacted FY2007 estimate was $1.14 billion. International Commissions The International Commissions account includes the U.S.-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), the International Fisheries Commissions (IFC), the International Joint Commission (IJC), the International Boundary Commission (IBC), and the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC). The IBWC's mission is to apply rights and obligations assumed by the United States and Mexico under numerous treaties and agreements, improve water quality of border rivers, and resolve border sanitation problems. The mission of the IFC is to recommend to member governments conservation and management measures for protecting marine resources. The IJC's mission is to develop and administer programs to help the United States and Canada with water quality and air pollution issues along their common border. The IBC is obligated by the Treaty of 1925 to maintain an effective boundary line between the United States and Canada. Established by the North American Free Trade Agreement, the BECC helps local states and communities to develop solutions to environmental problems along the U.S.-Mexico border. The FY2007 funding request of $63.9 million represented a decrease of 3.9% over the $66.5 million enacted in FY2006. The FY2007 requested decrease was due largely to a decrease in funds for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The House funding level for international commissions was $67.9 million, while the Senate committee level was $67.4 million. The final FY2007 enacted level was $67.0 million. Related Appropriations Related appropriations include those for the Asia Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and the East-West and North-South Centers. The Administration's FY2007 request for related appropriations totaled $103.6 million\u20148.7% less than the FY2006 enacted level of $113.6 million, after rescissions. The House-passed level of $68.1 million was close to half of the current level, largely because of the significant increase in funding for democracy promotion through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in FY2006. The Senate committee-recommended level was even lower\u2014$43.5 million\u2014because the committee recommended a much lower funding level for NED, as more funding was recommended in the Democracy Fund account, elsewhere in the bill. The total funding for related agencies in FY2007 was $108.6 million. The Asia Foundation The Asia Foundation (TAF) is a private, nonprofit organization that supports efforts to strengthen democratic processes and institutions in Asia, open markets, and improve U.S.-Asian cooperation. It receives government and private sector contributions. Government funds for the Foundation are appropriated and pass through the Department of State. The FY2007 request of $10 million reflected a 27.5% reduction over the FY2006 enacted funding level of $13.8 million. The organization stated that the $10 million would support programs that promote tolerance within Muslim minority/majority countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, and Cambodia; promote free and fair elections in Asia; and develop democratic institutions for legal reform in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand. The Asia Foundation had said it would continue to seek private funds and expected to raise $4 million in private funds for FY2007. The House bill set funding at $13.8 million, and the Senate committee recommended $14.0 million for the Asia Foundation in FY2007. The enacted level for the Asia Foundation for FY2007 was the same as the FY2006 level of $13.8 million. National Endowment for Democracy (NED) The National Endowment for Democracy is a private, nonprofit organization established during the Reagan Administration that supports programs to strengthen democratic institutions in more than 80 countries around the world. NED proponents assert that many of its accomplishments are possible because it is not a U.S. government agency. NED's critics claim that it duplicates government democracy promotion programs and could be eliminated or could be operated entirely through private sector funding. The FY2007 request was for $80 million, the same level as was requested for FY2005 and FY2006, and 8% higher than the final enacted level for FY2006 of $74.1 million, including rescissions. The House-passed NED funding level was $50 million for FY2007. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $8.8 million, as the Committee recommended more than $1 billion for the Democracy Fund elsewhere in the bill. The enacted FY2007 level was $74 million. East-West and North-South Centers The Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange between East and West (East-West Center), located in Honolulu, Hawaii, was established in 1960 by Congress to promote understanding and cooperation among the governments and peoples of the Asia/Pacific region and the United States. The FY2007 request for the East-West Center was $12 million, a 36.8% decline from the FY2006 enacted level of $19 million, after rescissions. The House level was $3 million, while the Senate committee recommended significantly more\u2014$19 million. The FY2007 enacted funding level was $19 million. The Center for Cultural and Technical interchange between North and South (North-South Center) is a national educational institution in Miami, Florida, closely affiliated with the University of Miami. It promotes better relations, commerce, and understanding among the nations of North America, South America and the Caribbean. The North-South Center began receiving a direct subsidy from the federal government in 1991; however, it has not received a direct appropriation since FY2000. The International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust Fund The conferees added language in the FY2004 conference agreement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2004, to establish a permanent trust fund for the International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue. The act provided $6.9 million for perpetual operations of the Center which is to be located in Istanbul, Turkey. Even though the Administration did not request any FY2005 funding for this Center, Congress provided $7.3 million for it in FY2005. The Administration requested spending $.8 million of interest and earnings from the Trust Fund for program funding in FY2006. Congress appropriated $4.9 million for this account in FY2006 and $0.9 million for the Trust. The Administration requested $0.7 million of interest and earnings from the Trust Fund program for FY2007. The House set spending of interest and earnings at $0.4 million, while the Senate committee set it at $0.75 million. The final legislation ( P.L. 110-5 ) set spending for the program at $.9 million. International Broadcasting International Broadcasting, which had been a primary function of the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) prior to 1999, now falls under an independent agency referred to as the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). The BBG includes the Voice of America (VOA), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Sawa, Radio Farda, and Radio Free Asia (RFA). In addition to the ongoing international broadcasting activities, the Administration initiated a new U.S. Middle East Television Network\u2014Alhurra. The BBG's FY2007 funding request totaled $671.9 million, 4.3% above the FY2006 level of $644 million, after rescissions. The FY2007 broadcasting request included $653.6 million for broadcasting operations, $18.3 million for capital improvements, and $36.3 million for Broadcasting to Cuba. The House passed funding at $651.3 million for broadcasting operations (including $36.1 million for Cuba Broadcasting) and $7.6 million for capital improvements for a total of $658.9 million for international broadcasting. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $653.6 million (including $36.3 million for Cuba Broadcasting) for broadcasting operations and $7.6 million for capital improvements for a total of $661.2 million. The enacted FY2007 funding for international broadcasting in FY2007 totals $644 million\u2014$636 million for broadcasting operations and $8 million for capital improvements.

The three-phase restructuring plan includes the National Contact Center, a two-year pilot project, that began in March 2005; the January 2006 commencement of field structure and staff realignment that the Commission approved in mid-2005; and the examination of headquarters' structure and operations to streamline functions and clarify roles and responsibilities. FY2007 Appropriations The 110 th Congress passed the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007, and it was signed into law ( P.L. 110-5 ) on February 15, 2007. The enacted funding level for the EEOC for FY2007 was reported to be $327.0 million, which is the same as the agency's budget in FY2006. The Administration had proposed a budget of $322.8 million for the EEOC, or $4.2 million less than the FY2006 appropriation. (The FY2006 figure of $327.0 million includes rescissions of $0.9 million and $3.3 million from the $331.2 million contained in the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006 [ P.L. 109-108 ]). The budget request would have reduced staffing by 19 full-time equivalents and provided up to $28 million for payments to state and local entities with which the agency has work-sharing agreements to address workplace discrimination within their jurisdictions (i.e., Fair Employment Practices Agencies, FEPAs, and Tribal Employment Rights Organizations, TEROs). Last year, the Administration requested up to $33 million for FEPAs and TEROs; this is the amount to which Congress had, in prior years, raised the EEOC's request. (The agency estimated it would spend $30.5 million on these work-sharing arrangements in FY2006.) In addition to the proposed reduction in the state and local contract maximum, the Commission anticipated offsetting its request for an additional $4.4 million to cover the staff's total compensation with cutbacks in general operating expenses and information technology (IT) expenditures. H.R. 5672 , which the House passed in June 2006, included funding for the EEOC at the level requested by the Administration ($322.8 million). The bill further concurred in the Administration's request that agency payments to FEPAs and TEROs not exceed $28 million. As in the past, the House would have prohibited the Commission from implementing any workforce repositioning, restructuring, or reorganization until it notified the Committees on Appropriations of such proposals. This also was stated in H.Rept. 109-520 , which further directed the EEOC to submit to the committee a comprehensive analysis of current staffing levels by department and the full impact the headquarters repositioning, restructuring , or reorganization will have on all core services, including the number of staff to be redeployed to the field. In addition, H.Rept. 109-520 instructed the agency to continue submitting quarterly status reports on projected and actual spending levels, by function, and highlighting any changes that result from repositioning activities. The House Appropriations Committee also expected the EEOC to use findings from the Inspector General's evaluation of the National Contact Center to improve the project's operation. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its bill in July 2006. S.Rept. 109-280 provided a larger appropriation of $327.0 million to the EEOC. Most of the additional funding would have gone toward agency payments to FEPAs and TEROS\u2014up to $33 million rather than $28 million. The Committee would have prohibited any sums to be used to fund the position of \"chief operating officer\" and to operate the National Contact Center. The Chair of the EEOC was further directed to assign at least 57 full-time permanent positions to the Commission's Baltimore office, among them a district director and regional attorney. S.Rept. 109-280 instructed the agency not to implement any workforce repositioning, restructuring, or reorganization until it notified the Senate Committee on Appropriations of such proposals. FY2006 Appropriations The Administration requested an FY2006 appropriation of $331.2 million for the EEOC, an increase of $4.4 million from the $326.8 million (including rescissions) provided by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 ( P.L. 108-447 ). Following the Appropriations Committees' recommendations, the House and Senate endorsed the Administration's budget proposal for the Commission. In November 2005, President Bush signed the FY2006 appropriations bill ( H.R. 2862 ), which included a rescission of 0.28%. In December 2005, the President signed the Department of Defense, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations to Address Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pandemic Influenza Act, 2006 ( H.R. 2863 , P.L. 109-148 ), which contained an additional rescission of 1.0%. The conference agreement adopted, by reference, language in H.Rept. 109-118 that requires the Commission to continue submitting quarterly reports on projected and actual spending levels by function and to highlight any changes due to repositioning activities. The conference agreement also adopted, by reference, language in S.Rept. 109-88 that (1) prohibits the agency from implementing a repositioning plan that reduces the salary of EEOC employees or reduces the number of officers or employees serving as mediators, investigators, or attorneys at any Commission office and that (2) directs the Commission to submit to Congress, before implementation of any repositioning, restructuring or reorganization plan, a comprehensive analysis (conducted for each district, field, area, and local office) of current investigations and enforcement levels and the full impact of such plan on all core services. The conference agreement further provided that the EEOC should not undertake any workforce repositioning, restructuring, or reorganizing without advance notification of the Committees on Appropriations. In addition, the conferees directed the Commission to continue working toward resolution of concerns regarding the pending repositioning plan. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)41 The Federal Communications Commission, created in 1934, is an independent agency charged with regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC is also charged with promoting the safety of life and property through wire and radio communications. The mandate of the FCC under the Communications Act is to make available to all people of the United States a rapid, efficient, nationwide, and worldwide wire and radio communication service. The FCC performs five major functions to fulfill this charge: spectrum allocation, creating rules to promote fair competition and protect consumers where required by market conditions, authorization of service, enhancement of public safety and homeland security, and enforcement. The FCC obtains the majority of its funding through the collection of regulatory fees pursuant to Title I, Section 9, of the Communications Act of 1934; therefore, its direct appropriation is considerably less than its overall budget. For FY2007, the Senate recommended an overall budget of $301.500 million for the salaries and expenses of the FCC, all of which is to be collected through regulatory fees (no direct appropriation). The Senate FY2007 recommendation was $1.042 million less than the Bush Administration request of $302.542 million and $11.742 million more than the FY2006 enacted appropriation of $289.758 million. The Senate expressed its continued concern about the declining standards of broadcast television and the impact that decline is having on America's children and also strongly urged the FCC to act expeditiously upon the complaint filed under Section 616 of the Communications Act regarding Washington Nationals baseball. For FY2007, the House of Representatives recommended an overall appropriation of $294.261 million for the salaries and expenses of the FCC. Of that figure, $293.261 million was to be collected through regulatory fees, with a direct appropriation of $1.0 million. The House FY2007 recommendation was $8.281 million less than the Bush Administration request of $302.542 million and $4.503 million more than the FY2006 enacted appropriation of $289.758 million. The recommended FY2007 funding level would cover efforts to promote the deployment of broadband services, deregulate where competition exists, enhance public safety and homeland security, ensure the viability of the Universal Service Fund, promote the efficient use of spectrum, and review media regulation to foster competition and diversity. The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution 2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) enacted funding level for the FCC for FY2007 was reported to be a direct appropriation of $1.0 million, which is the same as the agency's budget in FY2006. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)42 The Federal Trade Commission (Commission or FTC) is an independent agency. It seeks to protect consumers and enhance competition by eliminating unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the marketing of goods and services and by ensuring that consumer markets function competitively. For FY2007, the Administration had requested a program level of $223 million for the FTC, an increase of slightly more than $13 million, or 6.2%, over FY2006 funding. The House-passed bill provided the FTC with $213 million for FY2007, which was $3 million above the previous-year funding. For its part, the Senate followed the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, which set funding for the agency for FY2007 at the $223 million level. Of the amounts provided, $129 was to be derived from Hart-Scott-Rodino pre-merger filing fees and $18 million from so-called Do-Not-Call fees (more formally known as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, promulgated under the Telephone Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act). The total amount of direct appropriations for FY2007 was therefore $76 million. In recent years, the FTC has mostly funded its operations by means of its pre-merger filing fees collections and, to a lesser extent, from Do-Not-Call fees. By way of an historical footnote, for FY2000 through FY2002, zero ($0) direct appropriations were required, because the entire program level was covered by a combination of fees and prior-year collections. Legal Services Corporation (LSC)43 The LSC is a private, non-profit, federally funded corporation that provides grants to local offices that, in turn, provide legal assistance to low-income people in civil (non-criminal) cases. The LSC has been controversial since its incorporation in the early 1970s and has been operating without authorizing legislation since 1980. There have been ongoing debates over the adequacy of funding for the agency and the extent to which certain types of activities are appropriate for federally funded legal aid attorneys to undertake. In annual appropriations bills, Congress traditionally has included legislative provisions restricting the activities of LSC-funded grantees, such as prohibiting any lobbying activities or prohibiting representation in certain types of cases. P.L. 109-108 (enacted on November 22, 2005) included $330.8 million for the LSC for FY2006, the same amount that was originally passed by the House, instead of $358.5 million as passed by the Senate. The LSC FY2006 appropriation included $312.4 million for basic field programs and required independent audits, $12.8 million for management and administration; $1.3 million for client self-help and information technology, $2.5 million for the Office of the Inspector General, and $1.8 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census-based reallocations. In addition, P.L. 109-108 included language that advised the LSC to reduce its rent for its office space (by eliminating some office space and negotiating a more competitive cost per square foot) and included existing provisions restricting the activities of LSC grantees. P.L. 109-108 also included a general rescission equal to 0.28% of funding for the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies appropriation (which includes the LSC). Moreover, P.L. 109-148 (enacted on December 30, 2005) included a 1% government-wide rescission on discretionary programs. Thus, the LSC appropriation for FY2006 was lowered to $326.6 million. For FY2007, the Bush Administration requested $310.9 million for the LSC. This amount is almost $16 million below the FY2006 funding level for the LSC. The budget request included existing provisions restricting the activities of LSC grantees. The LSC would receive $288.6 million for basic field programs and required independent audits; $14.4 million for management and administration; $3.0 million for client self-help and information technology; $3.0 million for the Office of the Inspector General; and $2.0 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census-based reallocations. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $313.860 million for the LSC ( H.R. 5672 ; H.Rept. 109-520 ) and included existing provisions restricting the activities of LSC grantees. This is $3 million above the FY2007 budget request and $12.7 million below the FY2006 final appropriation. Since the LSC is a private, nonprofit corporation, it is not required to comply with federal laws related to employment, travel, and other administrative procedures, but the committee bill requires that the LSC submit a report to the committee no later than February 1, 2007, describing whether, in fact, LSC procedures adhere to federal law and, if discrepancies exist, proposals to modify LSC procedures so that they will comply with federal law. On June 27, 2006, the House passed a floor amendment (by Representative Obey, 337 yeas to 185 noes) that increased the LSC funding level by $25 million, from $313.9 million ( H.R. 5672 ; H.Rept. 109-520 ) to $338.9 million. Under the House-passed bill, the LSC would receive $321.9 million for basic field programs and required independent audits; $12.7 million for management and administration; $1.2 million for client self-help and information technology; and $3.0 million for the Office of the Inspector General. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a total of $358.527 million for the LSC ( H.R. 5672 ; S.Rept. 109-280 ) and included existing provisions restricting the activities of LSC grantees. This is $47.7 million above the FY2007 budget request, $31.9 million above the FY2006 final appropriation, and $19.7 million above the House-passed version of the bill. The LSC would receive $337.8 million for basic field programs and required independent audits; $12.8 million for management and administration; $3.0 million for client self-help and information technology; $3.0 million for the Office of the Inspector General; and $2.0 million in grants to offset losses stemming from the 2000 census-based reallocations. Congress passed a fourth continuing resolution ( H.J.Res. 20 ), which included provisions to fund most of the government agencies, including the LSC, through FY2007. H.J.Res. 20 passed the House on January 31, 2007, and passed the Senate on February 14, 2007. The final version ( P.L. 110-5 ) included language that specified that the LSC would be funded at $348.6 million for FY2007. The LSC FY2007 appropriation included $330.8 million for basic field programs and required independent audits, $12.7 million for management and administration; $2.1 million for client self-help and information technology, and $3.0 million for the Office of the Inspector General. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)44 The SEC administers and enforces federal securities laws to protect investors from fraud and to maintain fair and orderly markets. The SEC's budget is set through the normal appropriations process, but funds for the agency come from fees on sales of stock, new issues of stocks and bonds, corporate mergers, and other securities market transactions. The SEC is required to adjust the fee rates periodically to make the amount collected approximately equal to the agency's budget. When the fees are collected, they go to a special offsetting account available to appropriators, not to the Treasury's general fund. The Administration's request for FY2006 was $888.1 million, a decrease of 2.7% from FY2005. Of that total, $25.0 million was to be from prior-year unobligated balances, and the remaining $863.1 would be from offsetting fee collections. The House, the Senate, and the conference all approved an amount equal to the request: $888.1 million, of which $25.0 million came from prior-year unobligated balances, and the remainder ($863.1 million) from current-year fee collections. There was no direct appropriation from the general fund. For FY2007, the Administration requested $890.8 million, an increase of 0.3% over FY2006. The House approved $900.5 million for the SEC, 1.4% above the FY2006 appropriation and 1.1% above the Administration's request. Of that total, $20.0 million was to come from prior-year unobligated balances, and the remainder from current-year fee collections. The Senate committee recommended $890.8 million for the SEC in FY2007, the amount of the Administration's request. Finally, enacted budget authority under the continuing resolution was $892.6 million, of which $25.0 million was prior-year unobligated balances. There was no direct appropriation from the general fund. Small Business Administration (SBA)45 The SBA is an independent federal agency created by the Small Business Act of 1953. Although the agency administers a number of programs intended to assist small firms, arguably its three most important functions are to guarantee\u2014principally through the agency's Section 7(a) general business loan program\u2014business loans made by banks and other financial institutions; to make long-term, low-interest loans to small businesses, nonprofits, and households that are victims of hurricanes, earthquakes, other physical disasters, and acts of terrorism; and to serve as an advocate for small business within the federal government. The SBA's total budget for FY2007 increased to $572 million from FY2006's $456 million. The increase of $116 million was to fund the disaster loan program. In addition, $13.4 million of unobligated balances from previous years was rescinded. Lending authority would stay the same for all loan programs. State Justice Institute (SJI)46 The State Justice Institute (SJI) is a private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to state courts and funds research, technical assistance, and informational projects aimed at improving the quality of judicial administration in state courts across the United States. Under the terms of its enabling legislation, SJI is authorized to present its budget request directly to Congress, apart from the President's budget. With enactment of P.L. 110-5 , Congress determined that SJI would receive the same appropriation amount for FY2007, $3.46 million, as it received for FY2006. SJI had requested an appropriation of $4.5 million for FY2007, a 30.2% increase. By contrast, the Bush Administration, as in its budgets for the previous four years, proposed the complete elimination of federal funding for the institute in FY2007. In its passage, on June 29, 2006, of H.R. 5672 , the SSJC appropriations bill for FY2007, the House (following the recommendation of its Appropriations Committee) provided $2 million for SJI, $1.46 million less than the FY2006 funding amount. In its amended version of H.R. 5672 , reported on July 13, 2006, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended, as SJI had requested, $4.5 million, $1.05 million above FY2006 funding. For the five fiscal years prior to FY2007, appropriations conferees in Congress had encouraged SJI to obtain funds, at least in part, from sources other than Congress. In response to a directive from House-Senate conferees for the FY2006 appropriations act, SJI, in its FY2007 request, noted that it has adopted a 50% \"cash match requirement\" from its grantees. Also in its request, the institute stated that it continues to pursue grant-making partnerships with the Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), and other public and private entities, looking to \"pool its resources with OJP, LSC, and others to fund innovations in areas of mutual concern.\" In the FY2006 appropriations process, the House Appropriations Committee endorsed an approach of providing some directly appropriated funds to SJI, but with the institute as well seeking additional funding from Department of Justice grant programs. The House committee (in H.Rept. 109-118 , p.154) stated that it understood that SJI had \"been unable to generate stable sources of non-Federal funding\" and that the SJI had contacted bar associations and court organizations as possible alternative sources of funding. However, the committee noted, these groups were \"not inclined to contribute to operations of the SJI beyond providing matching grant funds for individual projects.\" For this reason, the committee said, it continued to recommend funding for SJI even though the President's FY2006 request did not. The committee commended SJI for beginning to work with OJP on issues involving state courts and encouraged SJI to continue seeking funds from OJP grant programs. The $3.5 million approved by Congress for SJI in FY2006 marked the second fiscal year in a row in which funding for the institute had been increased\u2014following a number of years during which appropriators in Congress considered whether to provide any funding for SJI. For FY2007, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $2 million for SJI in FY2007, $1.46 million less than the institute's FY2006 appropriation. The committee, in its report on the SSJC appropriation bill for FY2007, commended SJI for \"continuing to work with the Office of Justice Program (OJP) on issues involving State courts,\" and it encouraged SJI \"to continue to seek funding from OJP grant programs.\" The committee also \"applauded\" SJI for \"recent successes in obtaining dollar-for-dollar matching funds for grants awarded,\" adding that it expected \"this goal to remain in place during fiscal year 2007.\" For its part, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.5 million for SJI in FY2007, $1.05 million above the level enacted for FY2006. In its report, the committee's discussion of recommended funding for SJI simply noted that the institute had been created in 1984 to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in state courts. After the House passed (but prior to Senate passage of) the FY2007 continuing appropriations resolution, SJI's newsletter characterized the $3.46 million approved by the House for FY2007 as a \"'hard freeze' at our fiscal year (FY) 2006 funding level.\" It commented that although \"the 'glass is half empty' crowd might lament that figure, we are very comfortable with it,\" adding. \"We are grateful to Congress for their continued support and look forward to continuing to meet their high expectations of us.\" U.S. Commission on Civil Rights53 The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (Commission), established by the Civil Rights Act of 1957, investigates allegations of citizens that they were denied the right to vote based on color, race, religion, or national origin; studies and gathers information on legal developments constituting a denial of the equal protection of the laws; assesses federal laws and policies in the area of civil rights; and submits reports on its findings to the President and Congress when the Commission or the President deems it appropriate. For FY2007, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution provided $8.9 million for the Commission compared with President Bush's request of $9.31 million for the agency. FY2006 funding for the Commission was $8.9 million (including rescissions). U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom54 The Commission on International Religious Freedom was created by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-292 ) as a federal government commission to monitor religious freedom abroad and to advise the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress on promoting religious freedom and combating intolerance in other countries. For FY2007, the Administration requested $3 million, a 6.3% decline from the estimated FY2006 appropriation of $3.2 million, after rescissions. The House-passed bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the $3 million funding level for FY2007. The final enacted funding for FY2007 was $3.0 million for the Commission on International Religious Freedom. For FY2006, the Administration requested $3.0 million for the commission (the same as the FY2005 request). Sec. 808 of S. 600 , the Foreign Relations Authorizations for FY2006 and 2007, as introduced, included $3.0 million for the commission for FY2006 and such sums as may be necessary for FY2007. The House measure, H.R. 2601 , as agreed to by the House Committee on International Relations, authorized $3.3 million for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2011. H.R. 2862 , as passed by the House, appropriated $3.2 million for the commission for FY2006. In its report ( H.Rept. 109-118 ), the Appropriations Committee urged the commission and the State Department to continue to work on developing an Index on Religious Freedom. The Senate recommended $1 million for this account in FY2006. U.S. Institute of Peace55 The U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was established in 1984 by the U.S. Institute of Peace Act, Title XVII of the Defense Authorization Act of 1985 ( P.L. 98-525 ). USIP's mission is to promote international peace through activities such as educational programs, conferences and workshops, professional training, applied research, and dialogue facilitation in the United States and abroad. Prior to the FY2005 budget, USIP funding came from the Labor, HHS appropriation. In the FY2005 budget process, it was transferred to the Commerce, Justice, State and related agencies appropriation primarily for relevancy reasons. For the FY2007 request, the Administration request was $26.98 million, up nearly $5 million from the FY2006 estimated level of $22.07 million, after rescissions. The House-passed bill ( H.R. 5672 ) provided the requested amount, while the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $22.1 million in H.R. 5522 . The Senate committee noted that USIP received $5 million for programs and activities on Iraq and Afghanistan in the FY2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation ( P.L. 109-234 ). The final enacted funding for FY2007 was $22.1 million for USIP. Related Legislation H.R. 6101 (Cannon) Legal Services Corporation Improvement Act.

National Telecommunications and Information Administration15 The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)",
      " is the executive branch's principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology issues and policies. Its mandate is to provide greater access for all Americans to telecommunications services; to support U.S. attempts to open foreign markets; to advise on international telecommunications negotiations; to fund research grants for new technologies and their applications; and to assist nonprofit organizations converting to digital transmission in the 21 st century. The NTIA also manages federal use of radio frequency spectrum domestically and internationally. For FY2007, the continuing resolution (CR) provided FY2006 funding levels for NTIA, like most other federal agencies. For FY2006, that total amount for NTIA was $39.",
      "6 million. There are two major components to the NTIA budget (the Bush Administration has sought to create a third program in its FY2008 budget request, created out of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, discussed below). The first is Salaries and Expenses. For FY2006, and through the CR of FY2007, this program received $17.8 million. In the past, a large part of this program has been for the management of various information and telecommunications policies both domestically and internationally. Currently, a large part of this program ($7 million) is for the management of the federal government's use of the radio spectrum.",
      " For the FY2008 budget, the Bush Administration requested $18.5 million for Salaries and Expenses. For the second component, the Public Telecommunications and Facilities Program (PTFPC), Congress continued to fund this program at FY2006 levels through FY2007, at $21.7 million. The Bush Administration sought to end funding for this program in its FY2008 budget request. The third NTIA program that the Bush Administration requested in both its FY2007 and FY2008 budget requests came out of the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. That law\u2014and the creation of the new NTIA program\u2014called for the creation of a Digital Transition and Safety Public Fund,",
      " which would offset receipts from the auction of licenses to use electromagnetic spectrum recovered from discontinued analog signals. The Bush Administration set those reimbursable funds at $45 million in FY2007. These receipts would fund the following programmatic functions at NTIA: a digital-analog converter box program to assist consumers in meeting the 2009 deadline for receiving television broadcasts in digital format; public safety interoperable communications grants (which would be made to ensure that public safety agencies have a standardized format for sharing voice and data signals on the radio spectrum); New York City's 9/11 digital transition funding (until the planned Freedom Tower is built); assistance to low-power television stations for converting from analog to digital transmission;",
      " a national alert and tsunami warning program; and funding to enhance a national alert system as stated in the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004. However, complete funding for all of these functions under the FY2007 CR has not been completely determined as of this date. National Technical Information Service16 In accordance with the National Technical Information Act ( P.L. 100-519 ), as amended in 1992 by the American Technology Preeminence Act ( P.L. 102-245 ), the President's budget submission did not request any funding for the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) for FY2007. Similarly, the House of Representatives did not appropriate any funding for NTIS when it passed H.R.",
      " 5672 on June 29, 2006. Likewise, the Senate Committee on Appropriations did not appropriate any funding for NTIS when it passed H.R. 5672 on July 13, 2006. The continuing resolution used to fund the remaining portion of FY2007 ( P.L. 110-5 ) also did not include any funding for NTIS. Instead, funding for NTIS will continue to be drawn from NTIS' Revolving Fund, established by the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act for FY1993 ( P.L. 102-395 ). In part, due to NTIS's efforts to develop new products and limit spending,",
      " NTIS achieved a positive net income of $1.92 million for FY2006. This compares with a positive net income of $508,000 for FY2004, $10,000 for FY2003, $1.346 million for FY2002, and $2.290 million for FY2001. The NTIS is part of the Technology Administration at the Department of Commerce. The NTIS was established within the Department of Commerce in 1970, although its origins can be traced back to World War II with the creation of the Publications Board in 1945. The Publications Board collected classified scientific and technical information related to the war effort to be considered for release to the general public.",
      " These functions were formalized in 1950 with the establishment of the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information within the Bureau of Standards, which were later transferred to the newly created NTIS in 1970. According to its website, http://www.ntis.gov/, NTIS serves as \"the federal government's central source for the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and related business information by or for the U.S. government and complementary materials from international sources.\" Its mission is to support \"the nation's economic growth and job creation by providing access to information that stimulates innovation and discovery.\" The NTIS claims to hold approximately 3 million government information products,",
      " with 600,000 of these documents available through its online searchable database. In addition, NTIS offers a variety of fee-based services to federal agencies. These services include, but are not limited to, distribution of information products, support services, web development, multimedia production, and custom research services. The advent and rapid growth of electronic and multimedia publishing both challenges and affirms the role of NTIS. On the one hand, the growth of the Internet and electronic documents contributed, in part, to a decline in NTIS sales as more documents become available online at no charge from other sources. In addition, the emergence of a range of new information brokers raises the question of whether or not the services NTIS provides are redundant and/or directly compete with those provided by private sector companies.",
      " On the other hand, the dynamic nature of online content means that websites and their content can move location or disappear without notice. Moreover, even in the case of websites that are well established and relatively consistent in maintaining content, there is no guarantee that online materials will be archived or remain available indefinitely. In contrast, part of NTIS's responsibilities include maintaining a \"permanent repository\" of information. Bureau of the Census17 For discretionary domestic spending by the Bureau of the Census in FY2007, the Administration requested budget authority totaling $878.2 million: $184.1 million for salaries and expenses and $694.1 million for periodic programs,",
      " including the decennial census. The total request was $66 million greater than the FY2006 enacted amount of $812.2 million (and exceeded by $76.3 million the FY2006 level of $801.9 million, after rescissions). Much of the increase was due to preparations for the 2010 census, the Bureau's highest-priority program, which will involve a mail-out, mail-back short-form questionnaire to be answered by all U.S. households. The Bureau plans to replace the census long form with the American Community Survey (ACS), which provides yearly tabulations of data from monthly household samples. For the whole 2010 census program,",
      " the FY2007 request of $511.6 million was intended to go toward planning, testing, and developing the re-engineered census; improved mapping; and maintaining the full, nationwide ACS implementation level. To help fund the 2010 census, the Bureau proposed eliminating the Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey from the economic census. Also, the Bureau proposed phasing out and replacing the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), in the salaries and expenses account, as explained below. For the past two decades, the SIPP has been the leading source of [data on] the economic well-being of Americans. Its longitudinal household design provides many advantages;",
      " however, it also makes data processing and analysis difficult, leading to long delays before the data can be analyzed and understood. While the American Community Survey... and a growing body of administrative records now provide important sources of information, they cannot by themselves meet all the information needs of policy makers. The FY2007 request includes $9.2 million to design a new data collection system on income and wealth dynamics to meet the policy and operational needs of the country, which will replace the SIPP. Of the $9.2 million, the Bureau was to use $5.6 million to design the new data collection system and the remaining $3.",
      "6 million \"to facilitate the collection of another wave (i.e., a ninth wave) of 2004 SIPP panel data during FY2007,\" thus providing a full 2006 calendar year of SIPP data. The ninth wave, however, would have depended on the Bureau's \"success in getting partner agencies (such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Social Security Administration) that rely on SIPP data to also make combined investments of roughly another $6.4 [million], allowing for a ninth wave investment of $10 [million].\" The House Appropriations Committee recommended that the SIPP survey receive $10 million more than the requested amount in discretionary funds \"to continue SIPP data collection while a new survey is designed\"",
      " and that an additional $10 million \"from mandatory funds... be available to disseminate data collected from the SIPP in support of measuring the impact of welfare provisions.\" During consideration of H.R. 5672, the House approved three amendments to shift $58.3 million from FY2007 Census Bureau funding to crime-fighting endeavors. Representative Mark Kennedy proposed moving $50 million from the Bureau to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program under the Department of Justice to combat, in particular, crimes associated with methamphetamine. The House agreed to the amendment by a 291-129 vote (Roll No. 330). Representative Ginny Brown-Waite offered an amendment,",
      " approved by voice vote, to take $5 million from the Department of Justice's general administration and another $5 million from the Census Bureau and increase funding for the Violence Against Women Act by $10 million. Also approved on a voice vote was Representative Nancy Johnson's amendment to decrease Bureau funding by $3.3 million and increase, by the same amount, funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Innocent Images Program, which seeks to protect children from online sexual predators. The House agreed to $825.9 million for the Census Bureau in FY2007, $24 million more than the FY2006 enacted amount, after rescissions. The amount approved for salaries and expenses was $190.",
      "1 million; that for periodic programs was $635.8 million. The $58.3 million funding shift discussed above would have had, according to the Bureau, effects such as eliminating group quarters data collection for the ACS. Without these data, \"the ACS cannot fully represent the total population of the U.S.,\" including prisoners and the elderly in nursing homes, and \"cannot fully be the replacement for the long form in 2010.\" The Senate Appropriations Committee's recommended $828.2 million for the Bureau in FY2007 exceeded the House amount by $2.3 million and the FY2006 enacted amount, after rescissions,",

The shortfall was entirely in the periodic programs account, which was to receive $644.1 million instead of the requested $694.1 million. Salaries and expenses would have received $184.1 million, as requested. The committee report included language encouraging the Bureau \"to continue its hard work to minimize the number of personal visits for non-response follow-up for all census surveys.\" Increasing initial response rates would \"provide substantial cost savings in the ongoing American Community Survey, other periodic surveys, and the 2010 census.\" In P.L. 110-",

U.S. Patent and Trademark Office24 The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examines and approves applications for patents on claimed inventions and administers the registration of trademarks. It also assists other federal departments and agencies protect American intellectual property in the international marketplace. The USPTO is funded by user fees paid by customers that are designated as \"offsetting collections\" and subject to spending limits established by the Appropriations Committee.",
      " The President's FY2007 budget requested $1.843 billion in budget authority for the USPTO, an increase of 9.5% over the FY2006 figure. In addition, the budget document stated that the Office is to have \"full access\" to all fees collected in FY2007. The Administration also requested an extension of current law that temporarily increased patent fees for FY2005 and FY2006 and indicated that it will propose additional legislation to permanently extend this fee increase past FY2007. H.R. 5672, the FY2007 Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act as passed by the House during the 109 th Congress,",

The final FY2006 appropriations, P.L. 109-108, gave the USPTO the budget authority to spend $1.683 billion, a lesser amount due to a revision of estimated fee collections by the USPTO itself. Beginning in 1990, appropriation measures have limited the ability of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to utilize the full amount of fees collected in each fiscal year. This is an area of controversy. Opponents of this approach argue that agency operations are supported by payments for services that must be financed in the year the expenses are incurred. Proponents of methods to limit USPTO fee usage maintain that the fees are necessary to help balance the budget and the fees appropriated back to the Office are sufficient to cover operating costs.",

Science Agencies National Aeronautics and Space Administration31 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created by the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act (P.L. 85-568) to conduct civilian space and aeronautics activities. The agency is managed from headquarters in Washington,",
      " DC. It has nine major field centers around the country, plus the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated under contract by the California Institute of Technology. Dr. Michael Griffin became NASA Administrator in April 2005. NASA requested $16.792 billion for FY2007, a 1% increase over its FY2006 appropriation of $16.631 billion. If $385 million in supplemental funding for Hurricane Katrina response and recovery was excluded from the FY2006 figure, the requested increase for FY2007 was 3%. For FY2007 the House provided $16.709 billion in H.R. 5672. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $16.",
      "757 billion plus an additional $1.040 billion in emergency funding. The final continuing resolution ( P.L. 110-5 ) provided $16.247 billion, plus an unspecified amount for statutory increases in civil servant pay (Sec. 111). In September 2006, NASA announced a change in how it accounts for overhead expenses. The new system is known as \"full cost simplification.\" The change increases the stated cost of some programs and decreases the stated cost of others, without affecting actual program content. The increases and decreases exactly balance, so that NASA's total budget was unchanged. For any particular program, however, amounts expressed in the new accounting system were not directly comparable with amounts expressed in the previous system.",
      " In particular, amounts in the final FY2007 appropriation may not be directly comparable with amounts in the FY2007 request. NASA's initial operating plan for FY2007 would likely have clarified such comparisons, but it had not yet been made public. For more details, see CRS Report RS22381, cited at the end of this section. Budget priorities throughout NASA are being driven by the Vision for Space Exploration, announced by President Bush in January 2004 and endorsed by Congress in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 ( P.L. 109-155 ). The Vision includes returning the space shuttle to flight status, then retiring it by 2010;",
      " completing the space station, but discontinuing its use by the United States by 2017; returning humans to the moon by 2020; and then sending humans to Mars and \"worlds beyond.\" The President did not propose significantly increased funding for NASA to accomplish the Vision. Instead, most of the funding was to come from redirecting funds from other NASA activities. (Dr. Griffin has described this approach as \"go as you can afford to pay.\") The funding requirements of the Vision thus constrain other NASA priorities. In the Science, Aeronautics, and Exploration (SA&E) account, funding for Constellation Systems, the program responsible for developing vehicles to return humans to the moon,",
      " would have increased from $1.7 billion in FY2006 to $3.1 billion in the FY2007 request. The House provided $150 million less than the request for Exploration Systems, which consists of Constellation Systems and two smaller programs. The Senate committee also recommended less than the request for Exploration Systems. The final appropriation for Exploration Systems was $578 million less than the request, but the act was silent on how reductions should be allocated among Constellation Systems and the other programs. Meanwhile, also in SA&E, reduced growth in Science funding would have added up to a proposed reduction of $3.1 billion through FY2010 relative to projections in the previous year's request.",
      " Most of that reduction would have been to offset higher than expected costs for returning the space shuttle to flight status following the February 2003 Columbia accident. The request for Science included full funding for a Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, but funding for several robotic missions to Mars were cancelled or deferred. No funding was requested for the SOFIA airborne infrared telescope or the Europa mission to one of Jupiter's moons. The request for Research and Analysis, which provides grant funding to individual researchers, was down 15% from FY2006 in most programs. The House provided $75 million more than the request for Science, including $50 million for Research and Analysis.",
      " The Senate committee recommended increases totaling $31.5 million for two Science programs and directed NASA to proceed with SOFIA \"from within available funds.\" The final appropriation, however, was $5.251 billion, less than the request by $79 million. The request for Aeronautics Research in SA&E was about the same as was projected the previous year, but its content had changed significantly. The largest program, Vehicle Systems, has been renamed Fundamental Aeronautics and now focuses on \"core competencies\" in subsonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flight regimes, including work on rotorcraft. In the FY2006 budget cycle,",
      " proposals to eliminate several of these areas met with strong congressional opposition. An amendment to the Senate FY2007 budget resolution ( S.Amdt. 3033 to S.Con.Res. 83 ) increased the recommended funding for NASA aeronautics by $179 million. The House provided $100 million more than the request for Aeronautics Research. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $35 million more than the request. The final appropriation provided $890 million for aeronautics, more than the request by $166 million. In the Exploration Capabilities account, NASA's current human space flight programs, the space shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS), are also being significantly affected by the Vision.",
      " The President's speech directed that the space shuttle be retired in 2010 after ISS construction is completed. The Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) being developed by the Constellation Systems program, whose primary purpose is to take astronauts to the moon, would also be able to visit the ISS. However, because it is planned for \"no later than 2014\" there is likely to be a multi-year gap when the United States will be unable to launch its own astronauts into space. As for the ISS, the President's speech directed NASA to restructure the broad-based research program it had planned to conduct aboard ISS to support only research needed to accomplish the Vision.",
      " (Congress responded in the NASA Authorization Act of 2005 by directing that at least 15% of ISS research funding be used for research not related to the Vision.) It is unclear what will happen to the ISS after its use by NASA is completed in 2017. The House provided the requested amount for the space shuttle but less than the request for the ISS and other Exploration Capabilities activities. The Senate committee recommended the requested amount for Exploration Capabilities. The final appropriation for Exploration Capabilities was $6.140 billion, less than the request by $94 million. A Mikulski amendment in the full Senate Appropriations Committee markup created two new appropriations accounts for NASA:",
      " $1 billion for space shuttle Return to Flight expenses and $40 million for additional Hurricane Katrina recovery expenses. Both were designated as emergency funding. Neither was included in the request, the House bill, or the final appropriation.

National Science Foundation (NSF)32 Agency Mission The National Science Foundation (NSF) was created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950,",
      " as amended (P.L. 81-507). The NSF has the broad mission of supporting science and engineering in general and funding basic research across many disciplines. The majority of the research supported by the NSF is conducted at U.S. colleges and universities. In addition to helping to ensure the nation's supply of scientific and engineering personnel, the NSF promotes academic basic research and science and engineering education across many disciplines. Other federal agencies, in contrast, support mission-specific research. The NSF provides support for investigator-initiated, merit-reviewed, competitively selected awards, state-of-the-art tools, and instrumentation and facilities. Also, NSF provides almost 30%",
      " of the total federal support for science and mathematics education. Support is provided to academic institutions, industrial laboratories, private research firms, and major research facilities and centers. Although the NSF does not operate any laboratories, it does support Antarctic research stations, selected oceanographic vessels, and national research centers. In addition, the NSF supports university-industry relationships and U.S. participation in international scientific ventures. The NSF is an independent agency in the executive branch and under the leadership of a presidentially appointed Director and a National Science Board (NSB) composed of 24 scientists, engineers, and university and industry officials involved in research and education. The NSB and the Director make policy for the NSF.",
      " The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the NSF has the responsibility of, among other things, conducting audits and investigations of NSF programs, and promoting efficiency and effectiveness in NSF programs and operations. The OIG reports directly to the NSB and Congress. Key Budget Issues Overview of the FY2007 Appropriation The FY2007 appropriation for the National Science Foundation (NSF) was included in P.L. 110-5, H.J.Res. 20, Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2007. NSF is funded at $5.92 billion in FY2007, approximately $336 million (6%) above the FY2006 level of $5.",
      "58 billion. (The continuing resolution provided increased funding for the Research and Related Account (R&RA) for FY2007. All other accounts in NSF were maintained at approximately the same level as FY2006). The President's American Competitiveness Initiative proposes to double the NSF budget over the next 10 years. The FY2007 appropriation was to be the first installment toward that doubling effort. The FY2007 appropriation for NSF provided support for several interdependent priority areas: broadening participation in the science and engineering enterprise, providing world-class facilities and infrastructure, advancing research at the frontier, and bolstering K-12 education. NSF will invest more than $600 million in programs targeted at those groups underrepresented in the science and engineering workforce.",
      " Funding has been provided for the construction of world-class facilities and for activities at advancing research at the frontiers of science. NSF asserts that international research partnerships are critical to the nation in maintaining a competitive edge, addressing global issues, and capitalizing on global economic opportunities. To address these particular needs, the FY2007 appropriation provided increased funding for the Office of International Science and Engineering. Also, in FY2007, NSF will continue in its leadership role in planning U.S. participation in observance of the International Polar Year, which spans 2007 and 2008. A first-year investment was provided to address major challenges in polar research.",
      " Other FY2007 highlights include funding for the National Nanotechnology Initiative, investments in Climate Change Science Program, continued support for homeland security, and funding for Networking and Information Technology Research and Development. Also, a new effort in the FY2007 appropriation was support for a program of fundamental research on new technologies for sensor systems that detect explosives. The FY2007 appropriation included $4.67 billion for Research and Related Activities (R&RA), a 7.7% increase ($334.5million) over the FY2006 level of $4.33 billion. R&RA funds research projects, research facilities, and education and training activities.",
      " Partly in response to concerns in the scientific community about the imbalance between support for the life sciences and the physical sciences, the FY2007 appropriation provided increased funding for the physical sciences. Research in the physical sciences often leads to advances in other disciplines. R&RA includes Integrative Activities (IA) and is a source of funding for the acquisition and development of research instrumentation at U.S. colleges and universities. It also funds Partnerships for Innovation, disaster research teams, and the Science and Technology Policy Institute. The Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is funded in the R&RA. In FY2006, responsibility for funding the costs of icebreakers that support scientific research in polar regions was transferred from the U.S.",
      " Coast Guard to NSF. The NSF will continue to operate and maintain the three icebreakers. The OPP is funded at $485 million in the FY2007 appropriation, 24.2% above the FY2006 level. Significant increases in OPP for FY2007 are directed at the programs for Arctic and Antarctic sciences. Funding levels for other programs and activities in the R&RA resulting from the CR are not yet available. Research project support in the FY2007 appropriation totals approximately $2.40 billion. Support is provided to individuals and small groups conducting disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research. NSF supports a variety of individual centers and center programs.",
      " The FY2007 appropriation provided funding for Science and Technology Centers, Materials Centers, Engineering Research Centers, Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers, and Centers for Analysis and Synthesis. The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account was funded at the CR level of $190.9 million in FY2007, the same as FY2006. The MREFC supports the acquisition and construction of major research facilities and equipment that extend the boundaries of science, engineering, and technology. Of all federal agencies, NSF is the primary supporter of \"forefront instrumentation and facilities for the academic research and education communities.\" First priority for funding is directed at ongoing projects.",
      " Second priority is given to projects that have been approved by the National Science Board (NSB) for new starts. NSF requires that for a project to receive support, it must have \"the potential to shift the paradigm in scientific understanding and/or infrastructure technology.\" NSF states that the projects receiving support in the FY2007 appropriation meet that qualification. Six ongoing projects and two new starts are funded in FY2007. Projects receiving support are the Atacama Large Millimeter Array Construction ($64.3 million), EarthScope ($27.4 million), IceCube Neutrino Observatory ($28.7 million), National Ecological Observatory Network ($4 million), Scientific Ocean Drilling Vessel ($42.",
      "9 million), Alaskan Region Research Vessel ($9.4 million), and Ocean Observatories Initiative ($5.1 million). An additional $9.1 million was provided for the South Pole Station Modernization project. The FY2007 appropriation provided support for several NSF-wide investments: biocomplexity in the environment, human and social dynamics, and mathematical sciences. Additional priority areas include those of strengthening core disciplinary research, continuing as lead federal agency in networking and information technology R&D, and sustaining organizational excellence in NSF management practices. The NSF maintains that researchers need not only access to cutting-edge tools to pursue the increasing complexity of research, but funding to develop and design the tools critical to 21 st century research and education.",
      " A proposed investment of $596.8 million in cyberinfrastructure will allow for funding of modeling, simulation, visualization and data storage, and other communications breakthroughs. NSF anticipates that this level of funding will make cyberinfrastructure more powerful, stable, and accessible to researchers and educators through widely shared research facilities. Increasing grant size and duration has been a long-term priority for NSF. The funding rate for research grant applications has declined from approximately 30% in the late 1990s to an estimated 23% in FY2006. The FY2007 appropriation for the Education and Human Resources Directorate (EHR) was $796.",
      "7 million, the same level as FY2006. (Disaggregated data on funding of specific programs and activities in the EHR, as a result of the CR, are not yet available). The EHR portfolio is focused on, among other things, increasing the technological literacy of all citizens, preparing the next generation of science, engineering, and mathematics professionals, and closing the achievement gap in all scientific fields. Support is provided at the various educational levels: pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate. Priorities at the pre-college level include research and evaluation on education in science and engineering, informal science education, and a new program,",
      " Discovery Research K-12. Discovery Research will combine the strengths of three existing programs and encourage innovative thinking in K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. At the undergraduate level, approximately 72% of the funding was in support of new awards and activities. Priorities at the undergraduate level include the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program; Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Talent Expansion Program; the National STEM Education Digital Library; the Federal Cyber Service; and Advanced Technological Education. The Math and Science Partnership Program (MSP) has been transferred to the undergraduate level in FY2007.",
      " The MSP has made approximately 80 awards, with an overall funding rate of about 9%. No new partnerships have been proposed in FY2007. Funding in the FY2007 appropriation will provide support for ongoing awards, in addition to data collection, evaluation, knowledge management, and dissemination. At the graduate level, priorities are those of Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, Graduate Research Fellowships, and the Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education. Added support was given to several programs directed at increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in science, mathematics, and engineering. The FY2007 budget had requested the following amounts for theses programs:",
      " Historically Black Colleges and Universities Programs ($29.7 million), Tribal Colleges and Universities Program ($12.4 million), Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation ($39.7 million), and Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology ($24.9 million). As previously stated, the CR maintained FY2007 funding for the EHR at the FY2006 level, ($19.3 million less than the request), and it has not been determined as yet what the \"revised\" funding levels are for any of the science education programs. Policy Issues There has been considerable debate in the academic and scientific community and in Congress about the management and oversight of major projects selected for construction and the need for prioritization of potential projects funded in the MREFC account.",
      " The NSF was directed to improve its oversight of large projects by developing an implementation plan that included comprehensive guidelines and project oversight review. One continuing question focused on the selection process for including major projects in the upcoming budget cycle. In February 2004, the National Academies released the congressionally mandated study of the process for prioritization and oversight of projects in the MREFC account. The report recommended a more open process for project selection, broadened participation from various disciplines, and well-defined criteria for the selection process. In September 2005, the NSB released its management report on the new guidelines for the development, review, and approval of major projects:",
      " Setting Priorities for Large Research Facility Projects Supported by the National Science Foundation. The report describes facilities under construction and those being considered for future funding. Because of the changing nature of science and technology, NSF deems it essential that it have the flexibility to reconsider facilities at the various stages in their development. Also, the NSF states that it must be able to respond effectively to possible changes in interagency participation, international and cooperative agreements, or co-funding for major research facilities. The NSF encourages project planning from disciplines and fields in which scientists and engineers have not traditionally partnered or collaborated. The report notes that although some \"concepts\" may evolve into MREFC candidates,",
      " others may prove infeasible for major project support. The NSF has stated that the facility plan will be updated as needed. In September 2006, the NSF released the report, Investing in America's Future\u2014Strategic Plan FY2006-2011. NSF states that the report addresses the accelerating pace of scientific discoveries that are occurring in a more competitive international environment. The Strategic Plan lists several investment priorities that are targeted for increased emphasis of funding over the next five years. The investments include furthering U.S. economic competitiveness; promoting transformational, multidisciplinary research; improving k-12 teaching and learning in science and mathematics;",
      " developing a comprehensive, integrated cyberinfrastructure; and strengthening the nation's collaborative advantage through unique networks and innovative partnerships. In addition, NSF will continue to improve management excellence, with a focus on joining such areas as resource allocation, communication strategies, award management and oversight, and the core processes of merit review.

In its passage, on June 29, 2006, of H.R. 5672, the SSJC appropriations bill for FY2007, the House (following the recommendation of its Appropriations Committee) provided $2 million for SJI, $1.46 million less than the FY2006 funding amount.",

For the five fiscal years prior to FY2007, appropriations conferees in Congress had encouraged SJI to obtain funds, at least in part, from sources other than Congress. In response to a directive from House-Senate conferees for the FY2006 appropriations act, SJI, in its FY2007 request, noted that it has adopted a 50% \"cash match requirement\"",

However, the committee noted, these groups were \"not inclined to contribute to operations of the SJI beyond providing matching grant funds for individual projects.\" For this reason, the committee said, it continued to recommend funding for SJI even though the President's FY2006 request did not. The committee commended SJI for beginning to work with OJP on issues involving state courts and encouraged SJI to continue seeking funds from OJP grant programs.",
      " The $3.5 million approved by Congress for SJI in FY2006 marked the second fiscal year in a row in which funding for the institute had been increased\u2014following a number of years during which appropriators in Congress considered whether to provide any funding for SJI. For FY2007, the House Appropriations Committee recommended $2 million for SJI in FY2007, $1.46 million less than the institute's FY2006 appropriation. The committee, in its report on the SSJC appropriation bill for FY2007, commended SJI for \"continuing to work with the Office of Justice Program (OJP)",
      " on issues involving State courts,\" and it encouraged SJI \"to continue to seek funding from OJP grant programs.\" The committee also \"applauded\" SJI for \"recent successes in obtaining dollar-for-dollar matching funds for grants awarded,\" adding that it expected \"this goal to remain in place during fiscal year 2007.\" For its part, the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $4.5 million for SJI in FY2007, $1.05 million above the level enacted for FY2006. In its report, the committee's discussion of recommended funding for SJI simply noted that the institute had been created in 1984 to further the development and adoption of improved judicial administration in state courts.",

      " Commission on International Religious Freedom54 The Commission on International Religious Freedom was created by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 ( P.L. 105-292 ) as a federal government commission to monitor religious freedom abroad and to advise the President, the Secretary of State, and Congress on promoting religious freedom and combating intolerance in other countries. For FY2007, the Administration requested $3 million, a 6.3% decline from the estimated FY2006 appropriation of $3.2 million, after rescissions. The House-passed bill and the Senate Appropriations Committee agreed with the $3 million funding level for FY2007. The final enacted funding for FY2007 was $3.",

USIP's mission is to promote international peace through activities such as educational programs, conferences and workshops, professional training, applied research, and dialogue facilitation in the United States and abroad. Prior to the FY2005 budget, USIP funding came from the Labor, HHS appropriation. In the FY2005 budget process, it was transferred to the Commerce, Justice, State and related agencies appropriation primarily for relevancy reasons. For the FY2007 request, the Administration request was $26.98 million, up nearly $5 million from the FY2006 estimated level of $22.07 million, after rescissions. The House-passed bill ( H.R.",

    "answer": "This report monitors actions taken by the 109th Congress for the House's Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies (SSJC) and the Senate's Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (CJS) FY2007 appropriations bill. Appropriations bills reflect the jurisdiction of the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in which they are considered. Jurisdictions for the subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees changed at the beginning of the 109th Congress. On September 29, 2006, Congress passed the Defense Department Appropriation (H.R. 5631/P.L. 109-289), which included a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the most other agencies, including SSJC agencies, through November 17, 2006. On November 15, 2006, Congress passed a second CR (H.J.Res. 100) which extended funding provided in the initial continuing resolution through December 8, 2006. On December 8, the House passed a third CR (H.J.Res. 102), which extended funding through February 15, 2007. The Senate passed the measure on December 9. On February, 15, 2007, the President signed into law H.J.Res. 20 (P.L. 110-5), which amended P.L. 109-289, the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution, extending continuing appropriations through FY2007. For the FY2007 SSJC/CJS appropriations, the Administration requested $62.5 billion/$52.3 billion in the budget that it sent to Congress on February 6, 2006. The Administration request for the major departments and their related agencies are Department of Justice (DOJ), $21.3 billion; Department of Commerce (DOC), $6.3 billion; Department of State, $10.2 billion; Science, $22.8 billion; and Related Agencies, $2.3 billion. (The numbers may not add to the total due to rounding.) The House passed its SSJC appropriation bill (H.R. 5672) on June 29, providing a total of $62.6 billion. The House funding level included $22.5 billion for DOJ, $5.9 billion for DOC and related agencies, $22.7 billion for the Science agencies, $9.7 billion for the Department of State and international broadcasting, and $2.3 billion for related agencies. The Senate committee reported its bill covering State Department funding (H.R. 5522) on July 10. The enacted FY2006 appropriation provided $62.1 billion ($63.1 billion, including FY2006 supplemental funds) for the agencies under the jurisdiction of the Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations subcommittee of the House. The appropriations enacted for the major departments and their related agencies were DOJ, $21.7 billion; DOC, $6.6 billion; Department of State, $9.5 billion; Science, $22.2 billion; and Related Agencies, $2.5 billion. This report is the final update for the FY2007 SSJC report. Any future adjustments of the FY2007 numbers will be in the FY2008 appropriation report.\n",

    "context": "Background The Army Reserve is a partner with the active Army and the Army National  Guard in fulfilling the country's military and contingency needs. The Army  Reserve provides nearly half of the Army\u2019s combat support capabilities.  The Army Reserve has approximately 2,000 units that drill at 1,500 Army  Reserve Centers located in communities spread throughout the United  States and territories. As of May 2004, the Army Reserve reported that it  had about 328,000 members in the Ready Reserve. During peacetime, Army Reserve units report to the United States Army  Reserve Command (USARC), located in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Chief of  the Army Reserve, located in Washington, D.C. In addition, the Army  Reserve has established Regional Readiness Commands to provide  resource, logistics, and personnel management support for Army Reserve  units within their region. When not mobilized to active duty, Army Reserve  units are required to maintain readiness at a sufficiently high level to  facilitate prompt active duty mobilization. While in a reserve status, Army  Reserve soldiers are required to attend one drill weekend each month and  obtain a minimum amount of training (usually about 2 weeks) each year.  During national emergencies, the President has the authority to mobilize  the Army Reserve to active duty status. While mobilized, Army Reserve  units are accountable to the combatant commander of the theater in which  they are assigned to operate, and ultimately, to the President. On September 14, 2001, the President declared a national emergency as a  result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United  States. Concurrent with this declaration, the President authorized the  Secretary of Defense to mobilize reserve troops to active duty pursuant to  10 U.S.C. Section 12302. The Secretary of Defense delegated to the  Secretary of the Army the authority to order Army Reserve soldiers to  active duty. Since September 2001, the Army has mobilized unprecedented  numbers of Army Reserve soldiers (as well as other reserve and national  guard forces) to active duty on lengthy tours. DOD reported that as of April  2004, about 96,000 Army Reserve soldiers have been mobilized to active  duty at some point since September 2001 to carry out critical missions. In contrast to the Army National Guard forces that may be assigned  traditional combat roles, Army Reserve forces are generally assigned  combat support missions. The Army National Guard and Army Reserve  both include military police and intelligence units. However, while the  Army National Guard has special forces and other units that have combat  mission assignments, Army Reserve units are generally limited to combat  support mission assignments, such as supply, medical, and transportation  operations. Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 mobilizations during the period of our audit were  also affected by two other Army actions. First, the Army issued a \u201cstop  loss\u201d order affecting Army Reserve soldiers in November 2002. The stop  loss order was authorized by statute and allows the Army to retain soldiers  in the service beyond their date of separation or retirement for an open- ended period. Second, in November 2003, the Army extended the orders  for all mobilized Army Reserve soldiers expected to return from active duty  on December 1, 2003, for an additional year. There have been three major contingency operations involving mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers since September 2001: Operation Noble Eagle,  Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In general,  missions to provide domestic defense were funded through Operation  Noble Eagle, missions to fight terrorism outside the United States were  initially funded under Operation Enduring Freedom. More recently,  missions related to the combat in Iraq and subsequent policing operations  in that region were funded under Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example,  Army Reserve soldiers participated in combat support missions in  Afghanistan that were carried out as part of Operation Enduring Freedom,  whereas Army Reserve soldiers participating in homeland security  missions, such as assisting in intelligence data analysis, were considered  part of Operation Noble Eagle. According to Army Reserve data, approximately 45,700 Army Reserve  soldiers were activated as of April 2004. At that time, Army Reserve  soldiers accounted for about 27 percent of all mobilized DOD reserve  components. Many of these Army Reserve soldiers were mobilized as  small units, including about 2,800 units with 10 or fewer soldiers and about  1,000 one-soldier units. The Army assigns a separate unit identification  number to each of these small groups or detachments of Army Reserve  soldiers (these units are known as derivative units). According to Army  Reserve data as of April 2004, the Army Reserve had soldiers assigned to  almost 6,000 different unit numbers. While on active duty, all Army Reserve soldiers earn various statutorily  authorized types of pays and allowances. The types and amounts of pays  and allowances that Army Reserve soldiers are eligible to receive vary  depending upon rank and length of service, dependency status, skills and  certifications acquired, duty location, and the difficulty of the assignment.  While Army Reserve soldiers mobilized to active duty may be entitled to  receive over 50 types of pays and allowances, we focused on 14 types of  pays and allowances applicable to the Army Reserve units we selected for  case studies. As shown in table 1, we categorized these 14 pay and  allowance types into two groups: (1) pays, including basic pay, medical and  dental and foreign language proficiency skill-based pays, and location- based hostile fire and hardship duty pays, and (2) allowances, including allowances for housing, subsistence, family separation, and cost of living  for the continental United States. Several of these types of pays and allowances have multiple subcategories  of entitlement. For example, there are eight different types of basic  allowances for housing that soldiers may be entitled to receive based on  individual circumstances and documentation (including documents  establishing dependency status or court documents). In addition, Army  Reserve soldiers may be eligible for significant tax advantages associated  with their mobilization to active duty. Mobilized Army Reserve soldiers  assigned to or working in a designated combat zone are entitled to exclude  from taxable income certain types of military pays that would otherwise be  taxable. In addition to the complexities of determining and documenting the  specific circumstances surrounding each individual soldier\u2019s initial active  duty pay, allowance, and tax benefit entitlements, these types of pays and  benefits are further complicated because entitlements vary depending on  soldiers\u2019 locations as they move through their active duty tours. That is,  maintaining effective accountability and paying mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers as they move from location to location during their active duty  tours require extensive close coordination among a variety of operational,  personnel, finance, and pay organizations throughout DOD. Key  components requiring closely coordinated efforts in this worldwide team  are the  mobilized soldier;  unit commanders and unit administrators for all mobilized Army   United States Army Reserve Pay Center located at Fort McCoy;  Army Reserve Pay Management Division at Fort McPherson;  12 Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands;  U.S. Army Finance Command;  personnel and finance offices at Army mobilization stations;  Army area servicing finance offices assigned to support deployed units;   personnel and finance offices at Army demobilization stations;  Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at Indianapolis,   DFAS at Denver, Colorado; and  DFAS at Cleveland, Ohio. As shown in figure 1, three key phases are associated with the pays and  allowances applicable to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers:   (1) mobilization: starting applicable active duty pays and allowances,   (2) deployment: starting and stopping applicable location-based active duty  pays while continuing other nonlocation-based active duty pay and  allowance entitlements, and (3) demobilization: stopping active duty pays  and allowances. Mobilization Phase During the initial mobilization, units receive an alert order and begin a  mobilization preparation program, Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP).  Among other things, the SRP is intended to ensure that each soldier\u2019s  financial records are in order. The initial SRP is to be conducted by the  unit\u2019s administrator at the unit\u2019s home station assisted by personnel from  the cognizant Army Reserve Regional Readiness Command or designee.  This initial SRP is to include a verification of the accuracy of records  supporting applicable active duty pays and allowances. The unit  commander, supported by the unit administrator, is responsible for  ensuring that all personnel data, such as birth certificates for dependents  or foreign language certifications, are current for all soldiers under their  command. During this phase, the unit administrator is required to gather all  supporting documents and send the documentation to the Reserve Pay  Center at Fort McCoy. Pay technicians at the Reserve Pay Center are  responsible for entering transactions to start initiating basic pay and  allowances for mobilized Army Reserve soldiers based on the active duty  tour information that appears on a hard copy of each soldier\u2019s mobilization  order. If transactions are entered correctly and on time, activated Army  Reserve soldiers will automatically start to receive basic pay and basic  allowances for housing and subsistence based on the entered active duty  mobilization start date. After soldiers complete their initial SRP, they travel as a unit to an assigned  active duty Army mobilization station. At the mobilization station,  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are required to undergo a second SRP. As  part of this second SRP, finance personnel at the mobilization station are  responsible for confirming or correcting the results of the first SRP,  including obtaining the documentation necessary to support any changes  needed to the automated pay records. Pay technicians at the various Army  mobilization stations are required to promptly initiate appropriate active  duty pay and allowance transactions that were not initiated during the first  SRP. Transactions to initiate and terminate pays for all mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers entitled to receive special medical and dental pay  entitlements are entered and processed centrally at DFAS-Indianapolis. Deployment Phase While Army Reserve soldiers are deployed on active duty, there are several  active Army and DFAS components involved in paying them. The Army  area servicing finance office, which may be within the United States or in a  foreign country, is responsible for initiating pays earned while the soldier is  located in certain specified locations, such as location-based pays for  hostile fire and hardship duty. Pay technicians at these area servicing  finance offices are responsible for starting these types of pays for each  soldier based on documentation, such as annotated battle rosters or flight  manifests, showing when soldiers arrived at these designated locations.  Thereafter, hostile fire pay is automatically generated each pay period until  an established end-of-tour date is reached or a pay technician manually  stops the pay. In contrast, other location-based pays, such as hardship duty  pay, require manual entry of pay transactions each month by the assigned  Army area servicing finance office. While the designated Army area servicing finance offices have primary  responsibility for administering pay for deployed Army Reserve soldiers,  particularly starting and stopping location-based active duty pays (such as  hardship duty pay), finance personnel at the cognizant mobilization station  or at the Reserve Pay Center can also enter certain pay-altering  transactions that occur during deployments, such as those related to a  soldier\u2019s early separation from active duty. In addition, the Reserve Pay  Center has responsibility for entering all monthly nonlocation-based,  nonautomated pay and allowance transactions, such as foreign language  proficiency pay. Demobilization Phase Upon completion of an active duty tour, Army Reserve soldiers normally  return to the same active Army locations from which they were mobilized  for demobilization processing before returning to their home stations. The  personnel section at the demobilization station is required to provide each  soldier and the military pay technicians at the demobilization station with a  copy of the Release from Active Duty order and a DD Form 214, Certificate  of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. The demobilization station  military pay technicians are required to use the date of release from active  duty shown on these documents as a basis for stopping all Army Reserve  soldiers\u2019 active duty pay and allowances. The Reserve Pay Center is  responsible for discontinuing monthly input of all nonlocation-based,  nonautomated pays and allowances. If the active Army demobilization  station did not take action to stop active duty payments for demobilized  Army Reserve soldiers, or if a soldier did not return to the demobilization  station for active duty out-processing, the responsibility for stopping active  duty pays and allowances falls to the soldier\u2019s unit or the Reserve Pay  Center. Automated Systems  Environment Paying Army Reserve soldiers is complicated by the number of  nonintegrated, automated order-writing, tactical, personnel, and pay  systems involved in authorizing, entering, and processing active duty pays  and allowances to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers during the  mobilization, deployment, and demobilization phases of their active duty  tours. These automated systems are  the Defense Joint Military Pay System \u2013 Reserve Component (DJMS- RC)\u2014a DFAS-operated system used to pay reserve soldiers;  the Defense Military Pay Office (DMO)\u2014data input system used to enter  pay transactions for processing;   the Army Reserve\u2019s Regional Level Application System (RLAS),  including its personnel order-writing functions;  the Total Army Personnel Database\u2013Reserves (TAPDB-R);  the Army\u2019s Tactical Personnel System; and   the Army\u2019s Transition Processing (TRANSPROC) System. Many of these systems were originally designed for other purposes, but  have been adapted to help support payments to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. For example, DJMS-RC, a large, complex automated payroll  system application now used to pay Army and Air National Guard and  Army and Air Force Reserve soldiers, was originally designed to be used to  pay Reserve and Guard soldiers for monthly drills, short periods (30 days  or fewer) of active duty or training. DFAS has acknowledged that its  current military pay systems (including DJMS-RC) are aging, unresponsive,  fragile, and a major impediment to efficient and high-quality customer  service. DFAS has primary responsibility for developing guidance and managing  system operations for DJMS-RC. DFAS-Denver is responsible for designing,  developing, and maintaining customer requirements for all of DOD\u2019s  military pay services. Its Technical Support Office is responsible for  designing and maintaining the DJMS-RC core pay software. DFAS- Indianapolis is the central site for oversight of all Army military pay. As  such, DFAS-Indianapolis is responsible for maintaining an estimated   1 million Army soldier pay records, including those for Army Reserve  soldiers. DFAS-Indianapolis serves as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for DJMS-RC in that it  monitors the daily status of data uploaded to the system to ensure that all  received transactions are processed. After manual entry of the mobilization dates from hard copies of  mobilization orders into DJMS-RC, DJMS-RC is designed to automatically  generate most active duty pay and allowance payments based on the  mobilization date, twice a month, until the stop date is entered into the  system. Without additional manual intervention, DJMS-RC will  automatically stop generating these active duty payments to Army Reserve  soldiers as of the stop date recorded in DJMS-RC. This automated edit  control feature is intended to prevent erroneous payments to soldiers  beyond their authorized end of active duty date. Because pay and  personnel systems are not integrated, human intervention and additional  manual data entry are required when a pay or allowance error is detected  or an event occurs that requires a change in the soldier\u2019s pay-related  personnel and pay records. For example, a change in dependent status,  such as marriage or divorce; a promotion; jump pay disqualification; or  being demobilized before the active duty tour end date shown on a soldier\u2019s  original mobilization order would necessitate manual input to  appropriately change or eliminate some of the pays and allowances a  soldier would be entitled to receive. All Army Reserve soldier pays and allowances are to be documented in the  Master Military Pay Account\u2014the central repository for soldier pay  records in DJMS-RC. All pay-related transactions that are entered into  DJMS-RC, primarily through the DMO input application, update the Master  Military Pay Account. DMO is the DJMS-RC pay input subsystem used by  the Reserve Pay Center, active Army finance offices, and military pay  offices\u2014including offices located at overseas locations throughout the  world\u2014to enter transactions to initiate and stop active duty pays to  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. DMO is used to manually enter  transactions to (1) initiate any Army Reserve soldier pay and allowances  that were not started at initial mobilization, as well as applicable location- based pays, such as hostile fire and hardship duty pays, (2) stop all  location-based pays when soldiers depart designated locations, and   (3) stop all active duty pays and allowances at demobilization. In addition to DJMS-RC and DMO, the Army Reserve relies on four other  nonintegrated automated systems as a basis for authorizing active duty pay,  allowance, and related benefit entitlements to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers:  RLAS is operated at the Army Reserve\u2019s regional support locations and  contains multiple modules to support regional human resource,  resource management, and training operations for Army Reserve  soldiers. The personnel module within RLAS is used to process Army  Reserve personnel actions, including those that have an impact on pay,  such as promotions and discharges. Within the personnel module, there  is an order-writing sub-module used for writing and generating  mobilization orders for individual Army Reserve soldiers. Army Reserve  soldier data in the personnel module of RLAS is used by the RLAS order- writing sub-module to help create the individual orders for mobilized  soldiers. TAPDB-R is the central repository for Army Reserve-wide personnel  data. Selected pay-related personnel data, such as solders\u2019 initial  enrollment in the Army Reserve, contained in Army Reserve soldiers\u2019  pay records in DJMS-RC, are received through an automated interface  with TAPDB-R. The Tactical Personnel System is a stand-alone Army-wide personnel  system operated by Army personnel at overseas airports where Army  soldiers first enter or leave an overseas deployment location. Hard  copies of Tactical Personnel System-generated manifests showing  names and dates of soldiers\u2019 arrivals and departures are one source of  authorization for starting or stopping Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 location- based hostile fire pay, hardship duty pay, and combat zone tax exclusion  tax benefits. Arriving and departing soldiers can enter data, such as  name, rank, and Social Security number, into the Tactical Personnel  System from their common access cards using a barcode scanner  function. TRANSPROC is an Army-wide system used to track and support Army  soldier processing at mobilization and demobilization stations.  TRANSPROC is used to generate a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release  or Discharge from Active Duty, for Army Reserve soldiers completing  their active duty mobilization tours. Case Studies Illustrate  Pay Problems We identified significant pay problems at all eight of the Army Reserve case  study units we audited. Specifically, we identified 256 Army Reserve  soldiers who were overpaid their active duty pay and allowance  entitlements by about $247,000, 245 soldiers who received late pay and  allowance payments of about $77,000, and 294 soldiers who were  underpaid their pay and allowance entitlements by about $51,000. As  discussed in the following sections, we found that these pay problems were  associated with a series of processes, human capital issues, and automated  system deficiencies. The Army Reserve units we audited for our case studies had various  functions, including a Quartermaster (supply), dental services,  transportation, military police, and military intelligence unit. These units  were assigned a variety of combat support missions associated with the  global war on terrorism while mobilized on active duty in and around Iraq,  Afghanistan, Qatar, and Kuwait and in support of intelligence operations  here in the United States. The units we audited, their locations, and  information about their mobilizations are shown in table 2. Overall, 332 of the 348 soldiers (95 percent) in our eight case study units  that were mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the 18- month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at least one pay  problem associated with their mobilization to active duty. Many of the  soldiers had multiple pay problems associated with their active duty  mobilizations. Problems lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of  time. For example, for some soldiers, problems lingered through the entire  period of their active duty mobilization and for several months after their  active duty tours ended. Table 3 summarizes the number of Army Reserve  soldiers at each of our case study locations that had at least one problem  associated with their pays and allowances during each of the three phases  of their active duty mobilization. We counted soldiers\u2019 pay problems as a problem only in the phase in which  the problem first occurred, even if the problems persisted into subsequent  phases. In addition, many soldiers had more than one problem associated  with their entitled pays and allowances. Further, our case study audits  reflect only the problems we identified. However, because our audits were  only intended to provide more detailed perspective on the types and causes  of any pay problems experienced by mobilized Army Reserve soldiers,  rather than an exact calculation of what soldiers should have received, we  likely did not identify all of the active duty pay and allowance problems  related to our case study units. In addition to pay and allowance problems, while we did not attempt to  fully quantify the tax withholding and tax filing effects, we also identified  problems with timeliness and accuracy of combat zone tax exclusion  benefits for soldiers with the seven case study units we audited that were  deployed overseas in Kuwait, Afghanistan, Qatar, or Iraq. Specifically, while  soldiers in these units were eligible to receive their pays and allowances  tax free when they first arrived in-theater, almost all failed to receive this  benefit until at least a month after arrival. Over- and underpayment of  active duty pays and allowances for soldiers deployed in designated  combat zones adversely impacted the accuracy and timeliness of soldiers\u2019  combat zone tax exclusion benefits. Establishing the exact amount owed and collecting overpayments of active  duty pays and allowances erroneously provided to soldiers placed an  additional administrative burden on both the individual soldiers and DOD.  Soldiers were sometimes required to spend considerable time and were  frustrated in their efforts to determine the exact sums owed or to establish  a repayment plan. For example, it took one soldier over a year and about 20  phone calls, e-mails, and faxes to identify and resolve the active duty  overpayments and related tax benefits he received. In other instances, we  identified soldiers who received extensive improper active duty payments,  sometimes for over a year, but who may not have contacted anyone within  DOD to stop these erroneous overpayments. These soldiers received  significant overpayments, but did not acknowledge their receipt or set  aside sufficient funds to repay these erroneous overpayments. In these  instances, the soldiers may be subject to criminal prosecution. For  example, we identified a soldier who did not mobilize with his unit, yet  received over $36,000 in active duty pay and allowances for over a year.  When questioned, the soldier stated he was not aware that he had received  $36,000 in erroneous pay and could not immediately pay back all the  erroneous active duty overpayments he received. We referred this, and  other similar cases, to the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division for  further investigation into whether criminal prosecution of these soldiers  may be warranted for attempting to fraudulently convert government funds  to personal use. Further, these overpayment debts placed an additional labor-intensive  burden on the Army and DFAS. Determining the exact amounts soldiers  owed as a result of overpayments, particularly when the combat zone tax  exclusion benefits were involved, required labor-intensive efforts to gather  necessary supporting documentation (in some instances from multiple  locations) and compare these data with pay and tax withholdings,  sometimes spanning more than 1 year, to manually compute amounts owed  as a result of erroneous overpayments. In addition, DFAS was required to  track and monitor collections from soldiers against these debts. Collection  of these debts may become more difficult the longer they remain  outstanding. For example, Army auditors reported in 2003 that, to the  extent that soldiers leave the Army with outstanding debts, collection rates  are only about 40 percent. Examples of pay and allowance problems found through our audits of  soldiers\u2019 pay experiences at the eight case study units included the  following:  Forty-seven soldiers deployed overseas with the 824th Quartermaster  Company from North Carolina improperly received several months of  hardship duty pay, totaling about $30,000, for several months after they  left Kuwait. Nine soldiers of the 824th Quartermaster Company improperly received  family separation allowance payments totaling an estimated $6,250  while serving at Fort Bragg, their unit\u2019s home station. Forty-nine soldiers with the 824th Quartermaster Company did not  receive the hardship duty pay they were entitled to receive when they  arrived at their designated duty locations overseas until about 3 months  after their arrival. Subsequently, they continued to erroneously receive  hardship duty pay for 5 consecutive months after departure from their  overseas duty locations. Ten soldiers with the 443rd Military Police Company had problems with  their overseas housing allowance associated with their deployment in  Iraq, including five soldiers who were underpaid about $2,700 and seven  who did not receive their last allowance until more than 2 months after  their active duty tour ended. A soldier with the 443rd Military Police Company who demobilized from  an active duty deployment in August 2002, subsequently received  erroneous active duty payments of about $52,000 through May 2004.  These erroneous payments were not detected and stopped by DOD. The  soldier contacted us to ask for our assistance in resolving this matter. A soldier from the 965th Dental Company who received an emergency  evacuation from Kuwait as a result of an adverse reaction to anthrax  and antibiotic inoculations he received in preparing for his overseas  deployment, continued to receive about $2,900 in improper hostile fire  and hardship duty payments after his return from Kuwait. A soldier with the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment did not  receive an estimated $3,000 in family separation allowance payments  associated with his active duty mobilization. Further, seven of our eight units were deployed overseas during their  mobilization. Almost all the soldiers in these seven units had problems with  the timeliness of their combat zone tax exclusion benefits. All the soldiers  at our seven case study units who were deployed overseas experienced  problems with the late receipt of their combat zone tax benefits because  DJMS-RC could not simply stop withholding federal taxes, but instead had  to first withhold the taxes and then in the following month\u2019s pay  processing, reimburse the soldier the taxes previously withheld. As a  result, soldiers generally did not benefit from the tax exemption for at least  one month after their tax withholdings should have ceased. In addition to  this systemic issue, we identified other problems associated with these  benefits with respect to the soldiers at our case study units:  Twenty of the 20 soldiers with the 948th Forward Surgical Team waited  over 2 months after they arrived in Afghanistan to benefit from the  combat zone tax exclusion. It took nearly a year to identify and resolve a $1,100 overpayment  associated with one soldier\u2019s combat zone tax exclusion benefit. Several soldiers with Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company never  received the correct amount of reimbursement for taxes withheld,  which sometimes resulted in underwithholding taxes, and other times  resulted in overwithholding taxes. These pay mistakes were the source of many complaints, took  considerable time and effort to address, and were likely to have had an  adverse effect on soldier morale. In addition, soldiers at one of our case  study units told us that a delay in receiving their active duty pays and  allowances created financial hardship for them and their families.  Specifically, several of the unit\u2019s soldiers told us they could not pay their  bills when they were initially deployed overseas and were forced to borrow  money from friends and relatives in order to meet their financial  obligations. We provided data on the pay problems we identified to Army Reserve  officials. For the most part, they concurred with our analysis and reported  that they have taken action to address any identified over- and  underpayments and withholdings we identified. Appendixes II through IX  provide a more detailed description of the pay experiences of the soldiers  at each of the Army Reserve case study units we audited. Significant Weaknesses  Exist in Mobilized  Army Reserve Pay  Processes The pay problems we found were caused, at least in part, by design  weaknesses in the extensive, complex set of processes and procedures  relied on to provide active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits  to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. We identified issues with the  procedures in place for both determining eligibility and processing related  transactions of active duty pay to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. These  process weaknesses involve not only the finance and military pay  component of the Army, Army Reserve, and DFAS, but the Army\u2019s  operational and personnel functions as well. Specifically, we found  deficiencies in processes for (1) tracking and maintaining accountability  over soldiers as they moved from location to location to carry out their  mobilization orders, (2) carrying out SRPs\u2014primarily at the mobilization  stations, (3) distributing and reconciling key pay and personnel reports  during mobilizations, and (4) determining eligibility for the family  separation allowance associated with active duty mobilizations. Flaws in Procedures for  Tracking and Maintaining  Accountability over Soldiers  throughout Mobilization Mobilization policies and procedures did not provide the Army with  effective accountability and visibility over soldiers\u2019 locations to provide  reasonable assurance of accurate and timely payments for Army Reserve  soldiers\u2019 active duty mobilizations. Accountability breakdowns can occur  as soldiers pass through four main transitions during the course of a typical  mobilization cycle, including transitions from (1) their home station to  their designated mobilization station, (2) the mobilization station to their  assigned deployment location, (3) the deployment location to their  demobilization station, and (4) the demobilization station back to their  home station. Soldiers\u2019 active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits are directly  tied to being able to account for soldiers\u2019 locations during these transitions.  For example, timely data on the dates soldiers arrive at and leave  designated locations are essential for accurate and timely hardship duty  pays, allowances, and related combat zone tax exclusion benefits. To  effectively account for soldiers\u2019 movements during these transitions, unit  commanders, unit administrators, as well as individuals assigned to  personnel and finance offices across the Army Reserves, Army  mobilization stations, and in-theater Army locations must work closely and  communicate extensively to have the necessary data to pay Army Reserve  soldiers accurately and on time throughout their active duty tours. However, we identified several critical flaws in the soldier accountability  procedures in place during the period of our audit. Specifically, we  identified flawed procedures for accountability over soldiers\u2019 actual  locations and associated pay entitlements in that (1) soldiers received  mobilization orders, but did not report for active duty and (2) dates of  soldiers\u2019 arrival at, and departure from, designated hardship duty  deployment locations were not reported. Such breakdowns in  accountability procedures resulted in erroneously starting, or delays in  starting, active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits, and  erroneously continuing these pays, allowances and benefits when soldiers  were no longer entitled to receive them. Mobilization Station  Accountability Effective procedures were not in place to monitor and validate the  propriety of active duty payments to mobilized reservists. We found that  preventive controls for initiating and stopping active duty payments for  Army Reserve soldiers were ineffective. In addition, the accountability  controls in place at Army stations responsible for unit mobilization and  demobilization processing were not effective in detecting any Army  Reserve soldiers assigned to units passing through those locations who  were not entitled to receive active duty pays and allowances. As a result of  these control design flaws, we found several soldiers who received up to a  year of active duty payments based on issued mobilization orders, even  though the soldiers never reported for active duty. Army officials have  acknowledged that active duty payments are increasingly vulnerable to  such overpayments as a result of the Army Reserve\u2019s November 2003 action  to extend Army Reserve soldiers on active duty at that time for another  year. When a unit is called to active duty, soldiers in the mobilized unit receive  individual mobilization orders. Processing procedures provide that these  orders be used as a basis for initiating active duty pays and allowances to  begin on the first day of active duty designated in the individual active duty  mobilization orders. The Reserve Pay Center, located at Fort McCoy, is  generally responsible for initiating active duty pays and allowances based  on the data shown on a hard copy of the individual orders. However, the  Reserve Pay Center did not receive the data necessary to identify, on a unit- by-unit basis, which soldiers reported to the active Army mobilization  stations so that this information could be compared with a list of soldiers  for that unit for whom the Reserve Pay Center started active duty pays and  allowances. In addition, Army mobilization station finance personnel did  not receive a list of soldiers in a unit who were receiving active duty pay to  compare with the names of unit soldiers who actually reported to the  mobilization station. At one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company, we found that this  process flaw resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in overpayments. Individual Case Illustration: Flawed Soldier Location  Accountability Procedures Result in $36,000 Erroneous Active  Duty Payments A soldier assigned to the 965th Dental Company received a mobilization  order, but based on a discussion with his commander about a medical  condition, was told he would be transferred to a unit that was not  mobilizing. However, the unit commander did not provide a list of the  unit\u2019s mobilizing soldiers to the Reserve Pay Center and did not provide  any information on this soldier indicating that he would not be reporting  to the unit\u2019s mobilization station. Consequently, neither the Reserve Pay  Center nor the mobilization station personnel had any means of detecting  that a soldier had not mobilized with his unit and therefore was  improperly receiving active duty payments. As a result, the soldier\u2019s pay  was started on February 11, 2003, and continued through February 29,  2004, resulting in more than $36,000 in overpayments. This improper  active duty pay was stopped only after we identified the error and  notified Army officials. In another instance, the Army\u2019s inability to determine that one soldier\u2019s  actual location did not match his \u201cpaper\u201d mobilization resulted in an  estimated $52,000 in erroneous payments. Individual Case Illustration:  Soldier Accountability Flaws Lead  to Estimated $52,000 in Erroneous Active Duty Payments   A soldier contacted GAO in March 2004 to inquire as to why he had been  receiving active duty pay for almost a year even though, according to the  soldier, he was not mobilized to active duty during that time.  Subsequent  inquiry determined that, at least on paper, the soldier was transferred  from Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company to Pennsylvania\u2019s 307th  Military Police Company in February 2003, and was mobilized to active  duty with that unit on March 3, 2003.  Applicable active duty pays and  allowances for the soldier were initiated based on these March 3, 2003,  orders.  After the 307th Military Police Company demobilized in February  2004, the soldier\u2019s mobilization order was revoked.  Nonetheless,  available pay documentation indicated the soldier continued receiving  erroneous active duty pay and allowances for basic pay, and allowances  for subsistence, housing, and family separation totaling an estimated  $52,000 through May of 2004. In addition, Army Reserve officials told us about similar cases at other  units not included in our case studies in which soldiers did not report for  active duty, but nonetheless received erroneous active duty pay for lengthy  periods. They told us they identified soldiers who received large improper  active duty payments, some of whom had received erroneous active duty  payments for over a year before they were identified and stopped, as the  following examples illustrate:  A soldier from an Army Reserve chemical unit in South Carolina  received an individual mobilization order in February 2003, but did not  mobilize with the unit. Nonetheless, her active duty pays and allowances  (a total of over $45,000) continued until they were stopped in April 2004. A soldier from a Louisiana Army Reserve unit received an individual  mobilization order in January 2003. However, the unit commander  determined the soldier should not be mobilized with the unit because he  had not yet completed required training. Nonetheless, the soldier  received active duty pays and allowances totaling over $25,000 until they  were stopped in March 2004. A soldier attached to a Puerto Rico Quartermaster Reserve unit was  mobilized in February 2003, but did not report for active duty. The  soldier continued to receive improper active duty pays and allowances  totaling about $36,000 until the payments were stopped in April 2004. A soldier assigned to an Illinois Reserve Military Police Company  received an individual mobilization order in December 2002. However,  she did not report to the mobilization station with her unit and her  mobilization order was revoked in January 2003. Nonetheless, the  soldier continued to receive active duty pay and allowances totaling  about $24,000 until the payments were stopped in April 2004. Army Reserve officials told us that these improper payments were not  identified through any systemic preventive accountability control process  associated with an active duty mobilization or demobilization, but rather as  a result of after the fact detective controls in place at the unit or the Army  Reserve pay center. For example, one soldier reported for a weekend drill  and the unit pay administrator attempted to enter a transaction to pay him  for weekend drill duties. However, the unit pay administrator discovered  the soldier\u2019s receipt of erroneous active duty payments when the weekend  drill pay transaction was rejected by DJMS-RC. Army Reserve officials told  us they have referred these improper payments to the Army\u2019s Criminal  Investigations Division to determine if criminal prosecution of the soldiers  involved may be warranted. Deployment Accountability Flaws in soldier accountability procedures associated with overseas  deployment locations resulted in late, under-, and overpayments of active  duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits associated with almost all the  soldiers in our case study units. Soldiers were generally paid late or  underpaid location-based incentives upon their initial arrival into  designated hardship duty and hostile fire locations. Subsequently, they  were often overpaid these same location-based entitlements because these  payments continued, sometimes for long periods of time, after soldiers left  designated overseas locations. These failures occurred because Army  procedures in place during our audit were ineffective in accounting for  when soldiers entered into and departed from designated hardship duty  and hostile fire locations. In addition, as discussed in a subsequent section  of this report, automated systems deficiencies also contributed to, and in  some cases exacerbated, location-based active duty pay problems. According to DFAS procedures, Army local area servicing finance locations  are to obtain documentation showing soldier and associated arrival and  departure date information to start and stop location-based pays,  allowances, and associated tax benefits. We were told that flight manifest  lists generated through the Army\u2019s Tactical Personnel System were the  primary source documents used as a basis for entering manual transactions  to start and stop location-based pays during most of our audit period. One of our case study units, the 443rd Military Police Company, relied on an  extraordinary, labor-intensive workaround to ensure that necessary  documentation supporting any changes in the location of the unit\u2019s  soldiers, as well as other pay-support documentation, was received by the  unit\u2019s area servicing finance office while the soldiers were deployed in Iraq. Individual Case Illustration: Biweekly Flights to Transmit Unit  Pay Documents While deployed to guard Iraqi prisoners at Camp Cropper in Iraq, the unit  commander of the 443rd Military Police Company assigned a sergeant to  help address myriad pay complaints. The sergeant was deployed to Iraq  as a cook, but was assigned to assist in pay administration for the unit  because he was knowledgeable in DJMS-RC procedures and pay-support  documentation requirements and was acquainted with one of the soldiers  assigned to the unit\u2019s servicing finance office in Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.  Every 2 weeks, for about 5 months, the sergeant gathered relevant pay- support documentation from the unit\u2019s soldiers, took a 1 hour and 15  minute flight to the Kuwait airport, and then drove an hour to the Army  finance office at Camp Arifjan. The day following the sergeant\u2019s biweekly  journey to Camp Arifjan, the sergeant worked with the Army finance  officials at Camp Arifjan to enter transactions into DMO, often for 8-12  hours, to get unit soldiers\u2019 pay entitlements started or corrected,  particularly hardship duty pay requiring manual input every month. However, despite diligent efforts by Army local area servicing finance  officials to develop and maintain accurate lists of soldiers at the designated  deployment locations, our analysis of payments to soldiers at our case  study units indicated that this information was often not timely or accurate.  Finance officials at the Army area servicing finance offices either did not  obtain manifests (documentation showing soldier arrival and departure  dates) at all, received the documentation late (often months after the unit\u2019s  actual arrival or departure dates), or obtained manifests listing soldiers  that should not have been included for pay purposes. For example, an  Army Reserve soldier assigned to support Air Force operations did not  process through, or have any access to, an Army location that could  provide a manifest showing his arrival date in-country to local Army area  servicing finance office officials so that they could start his location-based  pays. In this case, the soldier did not receive his location-based pays until  he returned to his demobilization station and insisted that personnel at that  location take the actions necessary to start this payment. Also, we were  told that soldiers departing from designated locations on emergency or rest  and recreation leave, who are still entitled to continue to receive  designated location-based pays while on such leave, were sometimes  erroneously included on departure manifests used as source documents to  stop active duty location-based pays. These flawed procedures, which were relied on to account for Army  Reserve soldiers\u2019 actual locations and their related pay entitlements while  deployed, resulted in pay problems in all seven of our case study units that  deployed soldiers overseas, as the following examples illustrate:   All 49 soldiers that deployed overseas with our 824th Quartermaster  Company case study unit were underpaid their hardship duty pay when  they first arrived in the country. Subsequently, almost all soldiers in the  unit were overpaid their hardship duty pay---most for up to 5 months-- after they left the designated location, and some continued to receive  these payments even after they were released from active duty. In total,  we identified about $30,000 in improper hardship duty payments  received by this unit\u2019s soldiers. Seventy-six soldiers with the 965th Dental Company received improper  hardship duty payments totaling almost $47,000 after they had left their  hardship duty location. Ten soldiers with the 431st Chemical Detachment received improper  hardship duty payments for 7 months after their return to their home  station. None of the 24 soldiers deployed with the 629th Transportation  Detachment received hardship duty pay for the months they arrived and  departed the hardship duty areas. In addition, they did not receive  hostile fire pay for almost 3 months after their arrival at their assigned  overseas deployment locations. The debts created by overpayment of these location-based payments  placed an additional administrative burden on both the soldiers and the  department to calculate, monitor, and collect the corrected amounts. Lack of Clear Pay Review  Procedures at Mobilization  Stations Some of the pay problems we found were associated with flawed  procedural requirements for the pay support review, which is part of the  SRP process carried out at Army mobilization stations. Procedures  followed by Army mobilization station finance officials during the SRP  were inconsistent with respect to what constitutes a \u201cthorough review\u201d of  soldiers\u2019 pay support documentation to determine if it is current and  complete and has been entered into the DJMS-RC pay system. Procedures followed for our 824th Quartermaster Company case study unit  at the Fort Bragg mobilization station provided that the pay support portion  of the SRP at that location consisted of finance representatives briefing the  entire unit on required pay support. Finance personnel did not meet  individually with each soldier to compare his or her pay support  documentation with on-line soldier pay data in DJMS-RC. As a result,  missing or outdated documentation required to support active duty pays  and allowances at the time of the 824th Quartermaster Company\u2019s SRP  contributed to some of the late payments we identified. For example, one  soldier with this unit who was certified as ready for mobilization as a result  of the SRP, did not receive entitled family separation allowance payments  because documentation necessary to start this allowance was not  submitted as part of the SRP process. Six months later, after the soldier  demobilized at Fort Bragg, the paperwork necessary to receive this  allowance was obtained and submitted for payment. This soldier received  about 6 months of back family separation allowance in September 2003  totaling $1,400. We also found indications that the pay support documentation review  carried out at the Army\u2019s Fort Lee mobilization station was less than  thorough. Personnel at the Fort Lee mobilization station did not carry out a  detailed review of Master Military Pay Account records, which would have  shown that soldiers with the unit would stop receiving their entitled  housing allowances and family separation allowances because there were  incorrect end dates for these payments entered into DJMS-RC. As a result,  several soldiers from the 443rd Military Police Company had their basic  allowance for housing switched to a rate less than the soldiers were  entitled to receive and had their family separation allowance stopped for a  period during their deployment because the Fort Lee mobilization station  finance personnel did not take action necessary to extend the end-of- eligibility dates for these two entitlements. In contrast, pay support documentation review procedures in place as part  of the SRP at the Army\u2019s mobilization stations at Fort McCoy and Fort  Eustis provided that, in addition to a unitwide finance briefing, finance  officials at those sites were to conduct one-on-one pay support  documentation reviews with each soldier. Members of the 948th Forward  Surgical Team, who mobilized through Fort McCoy, and the 629th  Transportation Detachment, who processed through Fort Eustis, had their  pay records reviewed and compared to DJMS-RC on-line records by  finance officials during the finance portion of their SRP. We found very few  problems with either the 948th or 629th units\u2019 active duty pay entitlements,  excluding in-theater entitlements, after these units passed through the one- on-one soldier pay documentation review as part of the SRP at Fort McCoy  and Fort Eustis. Inadequate Processes in  Place for Reconciling and  Distributing Key Pay and  Personnel Reconciliation  Reports Design flaws in the procedures in place to obtain and reconcile key pay and  personnel reports impaired the Army\u2019s ability to detect improper active  duty payments. As discussed previously, we identified several cases and the  Army has also identified a number of instances in which such improper  payments continued for over a year without detection. The reserve pay review and validation procedures for Army Reserve  soldiers were initially designed to service reservists as they perform  weekend drills, annual training, and short-term active duty mobilizations of  30 days or fewer. Correspondingly, pay and personnel reconciliation  processes in place during our audit were focused primarily on  requirements for unit commanders to reconcile data for reserve soldiers  while they are in an inactive (drilling reservist) status. However, as  illustrated by the pay problems discussed in this report, there is an equal or  even greater need to clearly establish required procedures for the review  and reconciliation of pay and related personnel data for Army Reserve  soldiers mobilized on extended active duty tours. Specifically, with respect to the monthly review and reconciliation of two  key reports, the Pay/Personnel Mismatch Report and the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report, current procedures contained in  USARC Pamphlet 37-1 provide that unit commanders are required to  review the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report for soldiers in their  units on weekend drill activities and for active duty mobilization planning  activities. However, these procedures do not clearly require unit  commanders to review this key report for Army Reserve soldiers in  subsequent phases of their active duty mobilization tours. Appendix I of  USARC Pamphlet 37-1 provides that unit pay data in the Unit Commander\u2019s  Pay Management Report should be reconciled with unit training and  attendance reports, but does not require reconciling pay data with related  data on mobilized soldiers. As a result, the unit commander at one of our  case study units, the 965th Dental Company, stated that he did not believe  that a review and reconciliation was needed. Instead, he stated he relied on  the unit\u2019s soldiers to identify any pay problems. In light of the extensive  manual entry, and nonintegrated systems currently relied on for mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 pay, the timely and complete reconciliation of  comparable pay and personnel data in these key reports can serve as an  important detective control to identify any pay errors shortly after they  have occurred. In addition, Army guidance does not specify how deployed units are to  receive these reports. Distribution of these reports is particularly  problematic for units deployed in remote locations overseas. As a matter of  practice, we found that for units in an inactive status, the unit\u2019s Regional  Readiness Command usually provides these reports. However, we also  found no procedural guidance in place to distribute the same reports to  unit commanders and administrators while their units are on active duty.  Unit commanders for several of our case study units stated they did not  receive these key reports while their units were deployed. Had those  reports been available and reconciled, they could have been used to  identify and correct improper active duty payments, such as the large,  erroneous active duty overpayments discussed previously. Procedures for Applying  Family Separation  Allowance Eligibility  Requirements Were Not  Clear The existing procedures for applying eligibility requirements for activated  Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 family separation allowance payments were not  clear. These flawed procedural requirements for paying the family  separation allowance led to varying interpretations and pay errors for Army  Reserve soldiers at the implementing Army home stations and mobilization  stations. DOD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 7A policy clearly  provides that soldiers are entitled to receive a family separation allowance  if their family does not reside near the duty station, which is generally  defined as within 50 miles. However, DOD procedures and the form  needed to implement this FMR policy were not clear. Implementing  guidance and DD Form 1561 (a document that must be completed to  receive the family separation allowance) do not provide for a  determination that a soldier\u2019s family does not live near the soldier\u2019s duty  station. Specifically, DD Form 1561 does not specifically require soldiers to  certify that the soldier is entitled to receive family separation allowance  benefits because (1) they live over 50 miles away from the unit\u2019s home  station and do not commute daily or (2) the soldier\u2019s commander has  certified that the soldier\u2019s required commute to the duty station is not  reasonable. We noted that in several of our case study units, soldiers began  receiving the family separation allowance while stationed in Army  installations less than 50 miles away from their residence and without any  documentation showing the unit commander\u2019s determination that the  soldier\u2019s commute, even though within 50 miles, was nonetheless,  unreasonable. For example, soldiers from the 824th Quartermaster  Company received family separation allowance payments while stationed  at their Fort Bragg home station, even though they lived within 50 miles of  the base and no documentation was available showing that the unit  commander authorized an exception. In contrast, 14 soldiers with  Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company who lived over 50 miles away  from their home station, including several soldiers from Puerto Rico, did  not receive a family separation allowance as of the date of their arrival at  their home station. Human Capital Issues  Affect Pay Accuracy  and Timeliness Human capital weaknesses also contributed to the pay problems mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers experienced in our eight case study units. Our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  effective human capital practices are critical to establishing and  maintaining a strong internal control environment, including actions to  ensure that an organization has the appropriate number of employees to  carry out assigned responsibilities. Even in an operational environment  supported by a well-designed set of policies and procedures and a world- class integrated set of automated pay and personnel systems, an effective  human capital strategy\u2014 directed at ensuring that sufficient numbers of  people, with the appropriate knowledge and skills, are assigned to carry  out the existing extensive, complex operational requirements\u2014is essential.  Such a human capital strategy supporting accurate and timely active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers must encompass potentially  hundreds of DOD components that are now involved in carrying out the  extensive coordination, manual intervention, and reconciliations required  to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Well-trained pay-support personnel throughout various DOD components  are particularly critical given the extensive, cumbersome, and labor- intensive process requirements that have evolved to provide active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. We encountered many  sincere and well-meaning Army, Army Reserve, and DFAS personnel  involved in authorizing and processing active duty payments to these  soldiers. The fact that mobilized Army Reserve soldiers received any of  their entitled active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits accurately and  on-time is largely due to the dedication and tireless efforts of many of these  pay-support personnel to do the right thing for these mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers. However, in conjunction with our case studies, we  observed human capital weaknesses related to (1) inadequate resources  provided to support unit-level pay management, (2) inadequate pay  management training across the spectrum of pay-support personnel, and  (3) customer service breakdowns. Inadequate Resourcing for  Critical Unit Administrator  Positions Vacancies and turnovers in key unit administrator positions, and the  deployment of unit administrators to fill other military requirements,  impaired a unit\u2019s ability to carry out critical pay administration tasks that  could have prevented or led to early detection of pay problems associated  with our case study units. In addition to pay administration responsibilities,  unit administrator duties include personnel and supply operations. We  were told that vacancies in unit administrator positions were difficult to fill  and often remained vacant for many months because Army policy requires  the individual filling the unit administrator position to have a dual status,  which means the individual must perform duties both in the capacity of an  Army Reserve military occupation specialty as well as unit administrator. For example, at the 948th Forward Surgical Team, the unit administrator  position was vacant prior to and during the unit\u2019s mobilization. We were  informed that the 948th Forward Surgical Team had difficulty filling the  vacancy because of its dual status. Specifically, the unit officials stated that  this position was difficult to fill because the individual must have a medical  background to meet the dual status requirement. That is, the person filling  the position must be able to meet the unit\u2019s mission requirements as well as  have knowledge and experience performing the personnel, payroll, and  supply tasks of a unit administrator. In the absence of a unit administrator,  the unit commander assigned a sergeant with limited knowledge of pay  entitlements and DJMS-RC processing requirements to help carry out some  of the unit administrator\u2019s pay management duties. The sergeant told us  that during a 2-week period during late April 2003, she spent about 100  hours attempting to resolve the unit\u2019s pay problems, while concurrently  carrying out her duties as a health specialist. Providing adequate resources to support the execution of critical pay  management responsibilities was particularly problematic for Army  Reserve soldiers that were cross-leveled (transferred) to other units and  mobilized to active duty with those units. For three of the four case study  units we audited where small groups of Army Reserve soldiers were  transferred and mobilized to active duty with another unit, we found that  these soldiers experienced pay problems that could be attributed, at least  in part, to inadequate resources to carry out critical unit-level pay  management responsibilities. For example, because he did not have any  unit-level support to assist in processing his active duty payments, a soldier  who was mobilized as a single-soldier unit did not receive any location- based active duty pays until he returned from Qatar. Inadequate Pay  Management Training In addition to concerns about the level of resources provided to support  critical unit administrator positions, we identified instances in which the  lack of adequate unit administrator and finance office personnel training on  pay management duties and responsibilities contributed to the soldiers\u2019 pay  problems we identified. In addition, we found that unit commanders did  not always support these important pay management duties. Our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that  management should establish and maintain a positive and supportive  attitude toward internal controls and conscientious management. Several of the individuals serving as unit administrators in our case study  units informed us that they had received limited or no formal training  covering unit administrator responsibilities and that the training they did  receive did not prepare them for mobilization issues associated with  supporting and processing active duty pays and allowances. Unit  administrators have responsibility for a variety of pay-related actions,  including working with the unit soldiers to obtain critical pay support  documentation, maintaining copies of pay support records, providing pay- transaction support documentation to the Reserve Pay Center, and  reviewing pay reports for errors. Without adequate training, unit  administrators may not be aware of these critical pay management  responsibilities. Few unit administrators at our case study units had completed all of the  required training on active duty pay and allowance eligibility and  processing requirements. While unit administrators are required to attend  two courses (each lasting 2 weeks), few of the unit administrators for our  case study units took the required training at or near the time they assumed  these important pay management and other key unit administrator duties.  For example, the unit administrator at one of our case study units, the 824th  Quartermaster Company, stated she had not attended any formal training  courses, but instead received on-the-job training. Our audit showed that  she did not always effectively carry out her pay management report review  responsibilities. For example, while our audit of unit pay reports showed  she reviewed the documents, we saw no indication she used this tool to  identify and stop an overpayment of $18,000 to one soldier in her unit. As a  result, the erroneous pay was allowed to continue for another 5 months. At other units, we identified instances in which available documentation  indicated that unit administrators did not take timely action to submit pay- support transactions. For example, several soldiers with the 965th Dental  Company did not receive promotion pay increases and other entitlements  for over 2 months because the unit administrator failed to process  necessary pay-support documentation, available at the time of the unit\u2019s  initial SRP, until the unit was already deployed on active duty. At the 443rd  Military Police Company, we found the unit\u2019s finance sergeant assigned  pay management responsibilities did not gather and submit current  documentation needed to support active duty pays and allowances,  including current documents showing soldiers\u2019 marital status and number  of dependents. As a result, soldiers from the 443rd Military Police Company  experienced over-, under-, and late payments associated with their housing  and cost of living allowances. In addition to inadequate unit administrator training, inadequate training of  military pay technicians at Army finance offices at mobilization stations,  area servicing finance offices (for deployed soldiers), and demobilization  stations adversely affected the accuracy and timeliness of payments to  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Few of the military finance personnel  responsible for processing pays and allowances at the mobilization and  demobilization stations and at the area servicing finance offices for  deployed units had formal training on DJMS-RC pay procedures. Instead,  several of the military pay technicians and supervisors we talked to at the  Army mobilization and demobilization stations told us they relied primarily  on on-the-job training to become knowledgeable in the pay eligibility and  pay transaction processing requirements for mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. For example, military pay personnel at the Defense Military Pay  Office at Fort Eustis informed us that they did not receive any formal  training on active duty pay entitlements or DJMS-RC pay processing before  assuming their assigned responsibilities for mobilization and  demobilization pay processing. Instead, they stated they became  knowledgeable in mobilization and demobilization pay processing  procedures by processing hundreds of soldiers within 2 to 3 weeks of being  assigned these responsibilities. They also said they contacted full-time  civilians in the finance office, as well as Reserve Pay Center and DFAS  officials, by telephone for assistance. Also, few of the Army finance personnel at overseas area servicing finance  offices were adequately trained in active duty pay entitlements and  processing procedures for mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Specifically,  these key personnel with responsibility for location-based active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers deployed in Kuwait and Iraq  and surrounding areas did not receive formal training on pay eligibility and  DJMS-RC processing requirements before assuming their duties. USARC  Pamphlet 37-1 provides that an Army in-theater servicing finance office has  primary responsibility for supporting active duty payments to mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers when a reserve unit is deployed overseas. Camp  Arifjan was the Army location assigned responsibility for processing active  duty payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers deployed in Kuwait and  Iraq during 2003. Officials from the 336th Command, the Army command  with oversight responsibility for Camp Arifjan, confirmed that while  finance personnel at Camp Arifjan received training in the pay eligibility  and pay processing procedures for active duty Army soldiers, they were not  adequately trained in pay eligibility issues of Army Reserve soldiers. We were told of instances in which Army finance personnel were unable to  help reserve soldiers resolve their pay problems. For example, the 948th  Forward Surgical Team contacted an Army finance unit located in  Kandahar, Afghanistan, to request its assistance in resolving the unit\u2019s pay  problems. However, the finance personnel at that location were unable to  help resolve the 948th Forward Surgical Team\u2019s pay problems because they  said they had not had training in this area and were not familiar with DJMS- RC processing requirements and procedures. All 20 soldiers with the 948th  Forward Surgical Team experienced pay problems associated with their  location-based payments related to their deployment in Afghanistan,  including hardship duty pay. These payments require manual entry every  month by the unit\u2019s area servicing finance office. Further, we saw little evidence that the unit commanders of our case study  units received any training for their role in supporting their unit  administrators in these important pay management responsibilities. For  example, at one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company, the unit  commander informed us that he did not support the review of pay  management reports because soldiers had the capability to review their pay  online and would use this capability to identify and report any pay  problems. However, as discussed previously, we identified a number of  instances in which soldiers did not identify or report that they received  thousands of dollars in improper active duty payments. Customer Service  Breakdowns Our audit work at eight case study units identified significant soldier  concerns with both the level and quality of customer service they received  related to their active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits. The soldiers\u2019  concerns centered around three distinct areas: (1) the accessibility of  customer service, (2) the ability of customer service locations to help  soldiers, and (3) the treatment of soldiers requesting assistance. Servicing  soldiers and their families with pay inquiries and problems is particularly  critical in light of the error-prone processes and limited automated system  processing capabilities. Ultimately, pay accuracy is left largely to the  individual soldier. Although there are several sources that soldiers can turn to for pay issue  resolution, soldiers at our case study units experienced problems in  accessing these sources. Sources that soldiers can contact include their  home unit, the military pay section of the cognizant RRC, the  mobilization/demobilization station, the designated active Army area  servicing finance office in-theater, the online myPay system, and the 1-888- PAY-ARMY (729-2769) toll-free number. However, mission requirements  and the distance between deployment locations and field finance offices  often impaired the soldiers\u2019 ability to utilize the in-theater customer service  centers. Also, soldiers did not always have Internet and telephone access to  use the myPay system or to contact customer service sources such as 1- 888-PAY-ARMY, the home unit, or the cognizant RRC. The lack of Internet  access for deployed soldiers was particularly problematic because it  limited soldiers\u2019 access to pay, allowance, and tax benefit data reflected in  their leave and earnings statements. Lacking leave and earnings  statements, soldiers had no means to determine the propriety of their  active duty payments. For example, soldiers with the 948th Forward  Surgical Team told us that their inability to access the leave and earnings  statements adversely affected their overall morale. Even when mobilized reservists were able to contact customer service  sources, their pay issues often continued because the office they were  instructed to contact was unable to address their inquiry or correct their  problem. In some cases, customer service sources failed to help soldiers  because they lacked an understanding of what was needed to fix the  problems. When representatives of the 948th Forward Surgical Team  contacted their parent company for help in correcting pay problems,  personnel with the parent company informed them that they could not fix  the unit\u2019s pay problems because they (incorrectly) believed that the unit  was paid through the Army\u2019s active duty Army system. Soldiers at other  units were redirected from one source to another. Soldiers were not aware  of which sources could address which types of problems, and more  significantly, the customer service sources themselves often did not know  who should correct a specific problem. An Army Reserve major\u2019s experience illustrates the time and frustration  that was sometimes involved with soldiers\u2019 attempts to obtain customer  service for correcting errors in active duty pays, allowances, and related  tax benefits. Individual Case Illustration: Extensive, Time-consuming Action  Required to Resolve Pay Issue A soldier from Maryland was mobilized in March 2003 from the Army\u2019s  Individual Ready Reserve to active duty to serve as a liaison between the  Army and Air Force to help coordinate ground and air combat operations  in Iraq. After completing his 2-month active duty tour and returning to an  inactive reserve status in May 2003, he contacted Army officials to inform  them that he was continuing to receive active duty payments and  volunteered to immediately repay these erroneous overpayments. In July  2003, he wrote a check for $6,150.75 after receiving documentation  showing his debt computation. However, he continued to receive Leave  and Earnings Statements indicating that he had an outstanding debt. He  contacted his Army demobilization finance office to determine how to get  the erroneous outstanding debt removed from his pay records. After  being referred by officials at that location to various DFAS locations  (including once being told, \u201cThere is nothing more I can do for you.\u201d), he  contacted us for assistance. After DFAS recomputed the soldier\u2019s debt as  a result of our inquiry, the soldier was informed that he owed an  additional $1,140.54, because the original debt computation did not fully  consider the erroneous combat zone tax exclusion benefits he received.  Overall, he spent nearly a year after his 2-month active duty tour ended,  and about 20 phone calls, faxes, and letters in contacting at least seven  different DOD representatives at five different customer service centers  to correct active duty pay and allowance overpayments and associated  combat zone tax exclusion benefit problems. Finally, soldiers expressed concern about the treatment they sometimes  received while attempting to obtain customer service. Soldiers felt that  certain customer service representatives did not treat soldiers requesting  assistance with respect. For example, one soldier who attempted to make  corrections to his DD Form 214, Certificate of Discharge or Release from  Active Duty, informed us that mobilization station personnel told him that  the citations and dates of service he was trying to add \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d and  that he could fix them later. Additionally, some soldiers told us that while  they raised concerns about the quality of customer service they received  with respect to their pay inquiries and concerns, they were sometimes  ignored. For example, soldiers with Connecticut\u2019s 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment told us that while they contacted the local  Inspector General when they believed that finance personnel at their  deployment location had both actively tried to impair the payment of their  active duty entitlements and had tried to intimidate and discourage the  unit\u2019s soldiers from seeking help elsewhere, they were not aware of any  action taken as a result of their concerns. As a result, soldiers with the unit  told us they believed they had no recourse but to accept the poor treatment  they believed they received. Automated Systems  Deficiencies Constrain  Accurate and Timely  Payments Weaknesses in automated systems contributed significantly to the  underpayments, overpayments, and late payments we identified. These  weaknesses consisted of (1) nonintegrated systems with limited system  interfaces and (2) limited processing capabilities within the pay system.  The Army and DFAS rely on the same automated pay system to authorize  and process active duty payments for Army Reserve soldiers as they use for  Army National Guard soldiers. In addition, similar to the Army National  Guard, the Army Reserve\u2019s personnel and order-writing systems are not  integrated with the pay system. Consequently, many of the systems  problems experienced by mobilized Army Reserve soldiers were similar to  those that we identified in our report on pay issues associated with  mobilized Army National Guard soldiers. Because of the automated systems weaknesses, both Army Reserve and  active Army personnel must put forth significant manual effort to  accurately process pays and allowances for mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. Moreover, to compensate for the lack of automated controls over  the pay process, both DFAS and the Army place substantial reliance on the  review of pay reports to identify pay errors after the fact. Part of this  reliance includes the expectation that soldiers review their own leave and  earnings statements, even though these statements do not always provide  clear explanations of all payments made. Finally, because of DJMS-RC\u2019s  limitations, the system cannot simply stop withholding taxes for soldiers in  designated combat zone locations. Instead, for these soldiers, the system  withholds taxes and then reimburses the soldiers the amount that should  not have been withheld at least a month after the soldiers were first entitled  to receive this benefit. Automated Systems Are Not  Integrated and Have Limited  Interfaces The key pay and personnel systems involved in authorizing, entering,  processing, and paying mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are not integrated  and have only limited interfaces. Figure 2 provides an overview of the key  systems involved in authorizing, entering, processing, and making active  duty payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Lacking either an integrated or effectively interfaced set of personnel and  pay systems, DOD must rely on error-prone, manual data entry from the  same source documents into multiple systems. In an effectively integrated  system, changes to personnel records automatically update related payroll  records from a single source of data input. While not as efficient as an  integrated system, an automatic personnel-to-payroll system interface can  also reduce errors caused by repetitive manual data entry into more than  one system. Because of the lack of effective integration or interfaces among key  personnel and pay systems, pay-affecting data recorded in the personnel  system are not automatically updated in the pay system. Therefore, pay- affecting personnel changes recorded in the personnel system must be re- entered into the pay system from hard copies of documents, such as  soldiers\u2019 mobilization orders. We found numerous instances in which pay- affecting personnel information was not entered promptly into the pay  system, resulting in numerous pay errors. Individual Case Illustration: Overpayment due to Lack of  Integrated Personnel and Pay Systems A soldier assigned to an Illinois Military Police Company received a  mobilization order in December 2002 to report to Fort Dix, New Jersey.  Data from her individual mobilization order were entered into DJMS-RC  and she began receiving active duty pays and allowances based on the  active duty mobilization date shown in her mobilization order. However,  her mobilization order was revoked in early January 2003 after she was  found to be ineligible for mobilization. But, because of the lack of  integration or an effective interface between personnel and pay systems,  this order was not automatically processed in DJMS-RC to stop the  soldier\u2019s active duty pay. Consequently, the soldier was overpaid from  December 2002 through May 2004. Overpayments to the soldier totaled  over $24,000. We found several instances in which soldiers that were promoted while on  active duty did not receive their pay raises when they should have because  the promotion information was not promptly recorded in DJMS-RC. For  example, one Army Reserve soldier\u2019s promotion was effective on July 1,  2003. However, the soldier\u2019s promotion was not processed in the pay  system until October 2003, which delayed an increase in both his basic pay  and basic allowance for housing. The soldier finally received his promotion  pay, including back pay, in late October 2003, resulting in late payments  totaling over $2,700. Lacking an effective interface between pay and personnel systems, DOD  and the Army must rely on after-the-fact detective controls, such as pay and  personnel system data reconciliations, to identify and correct pay errors  occurring as a result of mismatches between personnel (TAPDB-R) and pay  system (DJMS-RC) data. In this regard, the Army Reserve has an automated  reconciliation tool\u2014the Participation Management and Reporting  Subsystem (PMARS)\u2014to help identify data inconsistencies between pay  and personnel systems. Specifically, the Army Reserve uses PMARS to  identify mismatches of soldiers accounted for in one system and not in the  other, and to compare the systems\u2019 information on individual soldiers, such  as their ranks and dates of service. However, this tool is not effective in  identifying soldiers that are being paid for active duty while in inactive  status because TAPDB-R currently does not capture and maintain this  information. Although TAPDB-R maintains a \u201cdeployability\u201d code, this code does not  necessarily indicate whether or not a soldier is on active duty. If TAPDB-R  included a code that specifically identified soldiers on active duty, then the  PMARS comparison of TAPDB-R data with DJMS-RC data could help  identify those soldiers improperly receiving active duty pay. Limited Automated  Processing Capabilities DJMS-RC was not designed to pay Army Reserve soldiers for active duty  tours longer than 30 days. According to DOD officials, requiring DJMS-RC  to process various types of pays and allowances for active duty tours that  exceed 30 days has stretched the system\u2019s automated processing  capabilities to the limit. Because of the system\u2019s limitations, the Army and  DFAS were required to make repetitive manual inputs for certain active  duty pays, such as hardship duty pay. We found many instances in which  these manual inputs resulted in payment errors. Moreover, because of the  way in which hardship duty pay was processed, mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers could not always determine whether they received all of their  entitled pays and allowances. In addition, under current processing  limitations, DJMS-RC does not process a required tax exclusion promptly  for soldiers in a combat zone, which has resulted in late payments of this  benefit for all entitled Army Reserve soldiers. Hardship Duty Pay During our audit period, we found numerous errors in hardship duty pay as  a result of a DJMS-RC processing limitation that required the use of a  miscellaneous payment code for processing this type of pay. Because of the  use of this miscellaneous code instead of a code specifically for hardship  duty pay, this pay could not be automatically generated on a monthly basis  once a soldier\u2019s eligibility was established. Therefore, hardship duty pay  had to be manually input every month for eligible soldiers. As previously  discussed, reliance on manual processing is more prone to payment errors  than automated processing. We found that nearly all soldiers in our case studies who were eligible for  hardship duty pay experienced problems with this pay, including late  payments, underpayments, and overpayments. For example, the 965th  Dental Company\u2019s soldiers at Seagoville, Texas, experienced both  underpayments and overpayments. Specifically, all 85 soldiers deployed to  Kuwait were underpaid a total of approximately $8,000 for hardship duty  pay they were entitled to receive during their deployment overseas.  Subsequently, 76 of the unit\u2019s soldiers were overpaid a total of almost  $47,000 because they continued to receive hardship duty payments for  more than 6 months after they had left the designated hardship duty  location. Both underpayments and overpayments, as well as late payments, of  hardship duty pay occurred largely because of the reliance on manual  processing of this pay every month. The errors often occurred because  local area servicing finance office personnel did not receive accurate or  timely documentation such as flight manifests or data from the Tactical  Personnel System indicating when soldiers arrived or left the designated  hardship duty location. As a result, finance personnel did not start these  payments on time, and did not stop these payments as of the end of the  soldiers\u2019 active duty tour date recorded in DJMS-RC. The DJMS-RC system processing limitation that led to using the systems\u2019  miscellaneous code to process hardship duty pay, also contributed to  overpayments of this active duty pay. That is, finance personnel mistakenly  continued to manually enter transactions to process hardship duty pay to  soldiers beyond soldiers\u2019 end of active tour dates because DFAS had no  way of implementing a system edit that could identify and stop erroneous  hardship duty pay while permitting other types of transactions processed  using this code to continue. Similarly, no edit was in place to prevent duplicate payments of hardship  duty pay. As a result, hardship duty pay could be entered more than once  for a soldier in a given month without detection. From our case studies, we  identified three soldiers who each received two hardship duty payments for  one month. None of these duplicate payments was identified or collected  until we submitted inquiries about these soldiers\u2019 payments to the Reserve  Pay Center. In addition, we were told that soldiers had difficulty  determining that they received duplicate hardship duty payments because  this type of payment was not clearly identified on their leave and earnings  statement. Use of the miscellaneous payment code also made it difficult for soldiers to  understand, and determine the propriety of, some of the payments  reflected on their leave and earnings statements. Hardship duty pay and  other payments that are processed using the miscellaneous payment code  are reported on leave and earnings statements as \u201cother credits.\u201d  Furthermore, the leave and earnings statements did not provide any  additional information about what the \u201cother credits\u201d were for unless pay  clerks entered additional explanations in the \u201cremarks\u201d section of the  statement, which they rarely did. As a result, soldiers often had no means  to determine if these types of payments were accurate. Unit commanders told us that they relied on soldiers to identify any pay  problems based on their review of their leave and earnings statements.  However, because leave and earnings statements do not always provide  adequate information or are not available to soldiers while they are  deployed, reliance on the soldiers to identify pay errors is not an effective  control. Combat Zone Tax Exclusion In addition to soldiers\u2019 pay problems that occurred primarily because of the  extensive use of manual processes, soldiers also experienced systematic  problems with automated payments related to their combat zone tax  exclusion, which resulted in late payments of this benefit for all soldiers in  the seven case study units that deployed overseas. Soldiers are entitled to  the combat zone tax exclusion for any month in which the soldier performs active service in a designated combat zone area. For any applicable  month, this benefit applies to the entire month, rather than being prorated  based on the number of days the soldier was in the combat zone. However, because DJMS-RC was designed as a pay system for inactive  Army Reserve soldiers, it does not have the processing capability to  suspend withholding of federal and state income taxes applicable to pay  that is ordinarily taxable. Instead, as a workaround procedure to  compensate for this limitation, the system first improperly withholds taxes  applicable to payments made while soldiers are in a combat zone, then  later reimburses soldiers for these withheld amounts in the following  month. For example, when an Army Reserve soldier is assigned to a  location where he is entitled to receive tax-free active duty pays, DJMS-RC  (improperly) withholds taxes from at least the soldier\u2019s first one or two  active duty payments. Subsequently, during the first pay cycle of the  following month, DJMS-RC reimburses the soldier for the amount of taxes  improperly withheld during the previous month. As a result of this  workaround process, all Army Reserve soldiers who served in a combat  zone received their combat zone tax exclusion benefit at least one month  late. DJMS-RC processing limitations cause further delays in soldiers\u2019 receipt of  entitled combat zone tax benefits when soldiers arrived in a combat zone  after the midmonth cutoff, which is approximately on the 7th day of each  month. In these cases, entitlement to the tax exclusion is not recognized  until the following month, which then delays the soldier\u2019s receipt of his  combat zone tax benefit until the next month\u2014the third month the soldier  is deployed in the combat zone. For example, members of the 824th  Quartermaster Company that deployed to Afghanistan arrived in country  on July 14, 2003, but did not receive their first combat zone tax exclusion  reimbursements until early October, almost 3 months after they became  eligible for the exclusion. Recent Actions Should  Result in  Improvements DOD and the Army have reported a number of relatively recent positive  actions with respect to processes, human capital practices, and automated  systems that, if implemented as reported, should improve the accuracy and  timeliness of active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits  provided to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. The accuracy and timeliness  of payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers rely on many of the same  processes and automated systems used for payments to mobilized Army  National Guard soldiers. Consequently, actions to improve the accuracy  and timeliness of Army Reserve soldier payments are closely tied to actions  taken in response to several of the recommendations in our November 2003  Army National Guard pay report. Because many of DOD\u2019s actions in this area were implemented in the fall of  2003 or later, they were not in place soon enough to have had a positive  impact on mobilized Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 payments as of the January  2004 cutoff for the soldier pay data we audited. However, if implemented as  reported to us, many of DOD\u2019s actions in response to our November 2003  report recommendations should help reduce the incidence of the types of  pay problems we identified for Army National Guard soldiers as well as  those identified in the Army Reserve case study units discussed in this  report. With respect to the process deficiencies and related recommendations,  DOD reported implementing additional procedural guidance intended to  help minimize the pay problems attributable to nonstandard or unclear  procedures. For example, in June 2004, the Army issued a comprehensive  \u201cFinance Mobilization and Demobilization Standing Operating Procedure.\u201d  This guidance clarified pay management responsibilities and transaction  processing requirements to be followed for all Army Reserve and Army  National Guard soldiers mobilized to active duty. One of the purposes of  this guidance is to eliminate any questions regarding which DOD entity is  responsible for resolving a soldier\u2019s pay issues or questions. Further, as of  January 2004, DOD reported establishing a new procedure under which  DFAS assumed responsibility (from the Army finance offices located in  various overseas locations) for all monthly manual entry of mobilized Army  Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers\u2019 location-based hardship duty  pay. DOD also reported completing several actions related to our previous  recommendations to improve the human capital practices related to  payments to mobilized Army soldiers. For example, the Army reported that  it had taken action to provide additional training for Army finance  personnel at overseas finance locations, mobilization and demobilization  stations, and for those Army finance personnel scheduled for deployment.  This training is directed at better ensuring that these personnel are  adequately trained on existing and new pay eligibility and pay processing  requirements for mobilized Army National Guard and Army Reserve  soldiers. DOD also reported establishing a new policy in January 2004  directed at more clearly affixing responsibility for addressing soldiers\u2019 pay  problems or inquiries. Under this new policy, the Army National Guard  established a pay ombudsman to serve as the single focal point for ensuring  coordinated, prompt customer service on all Army National Guard soldiers\u2019  pay problems. Thus far, DOD\u2019s reported actions have not yet addressed,  and consequently we are reiterating, our previous human capital  recommendations with respect to (1) requiring unit commanders to receive  training on the importance of adhering to requirements to carry out  monthly pay management responsibilities, and (2) modifying existing  training policies and procedures to require active Army pay and finance  personnel who are responsible for entering pay transactions for mobilized  reserve component soldiers to receive appropriate training upon assuming  such duties. With respect to automated systems, the Army and DFAS have  acknowledged serious deficiencies in the current automated systems used  to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers, and report that they have  implemented a number of significant improvements, particularly to reduce  an estimated 67,000 manual monthly entries for hardship duty pay. For  example, in response to our recommendations in the Army National Guard  report, DOD reported taking actions to (1) automate manual monthly  hardship duty pay in April 2004, (2) eliminate the use of the miscellaneous  code for processing hardship duty pay and instead process these payments  using a unique transaction code to facilitate implementing a system edit to  identify and stop erroneous payments, (3) compare active duty release  dates in the Army\u2019s system used to generate Release From Active Duty  orders with soldiers\u2019 end of active duty tour dates shown in DJMS-RC to  identify and stop any erroneous active duty pays, and (4) increase the  reliability and timeliness of documentation used to support soldiers\u2019 arrival  at and departure from designated overseas locations. However, DOD has not yet fully addressed, and consequently we are  reiterating two of our previous recommendations directed at interim  automated system improvements and one of our longer-term system  improvement recommendations. Specifically, we are reiterating previous  interim recommendations related to evaluating the feasibility of (1) using  the personnel-to-pay interface as a means to proactively alert pay  personnel of actions needed to start active duty pays and allowances and  (2) establishing an edit check and requiring approval before processing any  payments above a specified dollar amount. DOD has a major system enhancement effort under way in this area\u2014the  Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS). As an  interim measure, DOD is now pursuing Forward Compatible Payroll (FCP).  FCP is intended to replace payroll systems now used to pay Army military  personnel and help eliminate several of the labor-intensive, error-prone  workarounds necessitated by current DJMS-RC processing limitations. As  of May 2004, FCP was expected to be operational for all Army Reserve  soldiers by March 2005. We are also reiterating our previous longer term recommendation with  respect to taking action to ensure that DIMHRS and related efforts include  a complete reengineering of not only the related automated systems, but  the supporting processes and human capital practices used to pay  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers as well. Such fundamental reengineering  is necessary because, as discussed in the preceding sections, many of the  pay problems we found were associated with procedural and human  capital practice issues, as well as nonintegrated automated systems that  extend beyond existing pay system processing limitations. Conclusions The increased operating tempo for Army Reserve and Army National Guard  active duty mobilizations has stressed the current processes, human  capital, and automated systems relied on to pay these soldiers. The  significant number of problems we identified associated with active duty  pays, allowances, and related tax benefits provided to mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers at eight case study locations raises serious concerns about  whether current operations can be relied on to provide accurate and timely  payments. These pay problems caused considerable frustration, adversely  affected soldiers\u2019 morale, and placed an additional, unnecessary burden on  both the soldiers and their families. Further, if not effectively addressed,  these pay problems may ultimately have an adverse impact on Army  Reserve reenlistment and retention. Strengthening existing processes, human capital practices, and automated  systems is critical to preventing, or at minimum, promptly detecting and  correcting, the errors we identified. In this regard, DOD and the Army have  reported a number of relatively recent positive actions intended to improve  the accuracy and timeliness of active duty pays, allowances, and related tax  benefits provided to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. DOD\u2019s completed  and planned near-term actions, if implemented as reported, should reduce  the number of pay problems. However, mobilized Army Reserve soldiers  cannot be reasonably assured of accurate and timely active duty pays,  allowances, and related tax benefits until DOD completes a reengineering  of all the processes, human capital practices, and automated systems  supporting this critical area. Fully and effectively addressing Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 pay problems will  require priority attention and sustained, concerted, coordinated efforts by  DFAS, the Army, and the Army Reserve to build on actions taken and  planned. For these reasons, we are reaffirming two of our previous human  capital-related recommendations and three of our previous automated  systems-related recommendations from our November 2003 report on  payments to mobilized Army National Guard soldiers. However, we are also  offering 15 additional recommendations identified as a result of our audit  of mobilized Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 pay experiences. Recommendations for  Executive Action We recommend that the Secretary of the Army, in conjunction with the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), take the following 15 actions to  address the issues we found with respect to the existing processes,  personnel (human capital), and automated systems relied on to pay  activated Army Reserve soldiers. Establish procedures for unit commanders and unit administrators, or  other designated officials (for soldiers transferred between units), to  reconcile the names of Army Reserve soldiers receiving active duty pay  with the names of Army Reserve soldiers reporting for duty at  mobilization stations. Establish procedures for unit commanders and unit administrators, or  other designated officials, to provide the names and arrival dates for all  soldiers entering and exiting in-theater locations to a designated area  servicing finance office to facilitate accurate and timely payment of in- theater location-based active duty pays, allowances, and related tax  benefits. Establish procedures to provide demobilization stations with a list of  soldiers returning from overseas that are scheduled to arrive at the  demobilization station for outprocessing. Establish procedures to reconcile the names of Army Reserve soldiers  who recently demobilized with the names of Army Reserve soldiers still  receiving mobilization pay and take appropriate action to resolve any  identified pay issues. Clarify policy concerning \u201cthorough\u201d review of soldiers\u2019 pay records  upon initial mobilization to specify that finance personnel at Army  mobilization stations must conduct a one-on-one review of online pay  records for each mobilized soldier. Establish procedures to ensure unit commanders and unit  administrators, or other designated officials, have online access to pay  management reports, such as the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management  Report, particularly for mobilized units. Clarify DJMS-RC procedures to specifically require unit commanders,  unit administrators, or other designated officials to review and reconcile  key pay and personnel data every month, including personnel records,  with the monthly Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report, for all  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Clarify and simplify procedures and forms implementing the family  separation allowance entitlement policy, particularly with respect to the  30-day waiting period and commuting distance criteria. Take appropriate action to address the issues of inadequate resources  provided to carry out key unit administrator pay management  responsibilities identified at our case study units, particularly with  respect to (1) vacancies in unit administrator positions resulting from  the requirement for dual status unit administrators and (2) lack of pay  management support for Army Reserve soldiers transferred between  units. Determine whether issues of inadequate resources identified at our case  study units apply to other mobilized Army Reserve units and soldiers,  and if so, take appropriate action to address any deficiencies identified. Evaluate the feasibility of establishing an ombudsman to serve as the  single focal point and have overall coordination responsibility and  visibility to ensure that all Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 problems and  inquiries with respect to applicable active duty pays, allowances, and  related combat zone tax exclusion benefits are promptly and fully  resolved. Interim Improvements to Current Automated Systems  Evaluate the feasibility of modifying the deployability code or adding  a duty status code in TAPDB-R that can be compared with the pay  status code field in DJMS-RC to assist in identifying pay errors  resulting from discrepancies between the soldiers\u2019 duty status and  pay status. Evaluate the feasibility of modifying DJMS-RC to suspend  withholding taxes from soldiers when they serve in designated tax- exempt combat zones. Evaluate the feasibility of establishing a system edit to prevent DJMS- RC from generating payments for active duty service to soldiers after  their date of demobilization from active duty. Address the deficiencies noted in this report as part of the functional  requirements for the FCP and DIMHRS system development efforts  currently under way. Agency Comments and  our Evaluation In its written comments, DOD concurred with our recommendations and  stated its actions to address the identified deficiencies. Specifically, DOD\u2019s  response outlined some actions already taken, others that are under way,  and further planned actions with respect to our recommendations. If  effectively implemented, these actions should substantially resolve the  deficiencies pointed out in our report. DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix X.

Scope and Methodology To obtain an understanding and assess the processes, personnel (human  capital), and systems used to provide assurance that mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers were paid accurately and on time, we reviewed applicable  laws, policies, procedures, and program guidance; observed pay processing  operations; and interviewed cognizant agency officials. The key laws,  policies, and procedures, we obtained and reviewed included  10 U.S.C. Section 12302;   DOD Directive Number 1235.10, \u201cActivation, Mobilization &  Demobilization of the Ready Reserve;\u201d DOD FMR, Volume 7A, \u201cMilitary Pay Policy and Procedures Active Duty  and Reserve Pay;\u201d USARC Regulation 37-1, \u201cFinancial Administration: USAR Financial  Management and USAR Support;\u201d USARC Pamphlet 37-1, \u201cDefense Joint Military Pay System \u2013 Reserve  Component (DJMS-RC) Procedures Manual;\u201d Army Regulation 600-8-101, \u201cPersonnel Processing (In-, Out-, Soldier  Readiness, Mobilization, and Deployment Processing);\u201d  the Army\u2019s Consolidated Personnel Policy Guidance for Operations  Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom, September 2002; and   500-3-3, Reserve Component Unit Commander\u2019s Handbook;   500-3-4, Installation Commander\u2019s Handbook; and  500-3-5, Demobilization Plan. We also reviewed various Under Secretary of Defense memorandums, a  memorandum of agreement between Army and DFAS, and DFAS, Army,  Army Forces Command, and Army Reserve Command guidance applicable  to pay for mobilized reserve component soldiers. We also used the internal control standards provided in the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government. We applied the policies and procedures prescribed in these documents to  the observed and documented procedures and practices followed by the  various DOD components involved in providing active duty pay to Army  Reserve soldiers. We also interviewed officials from USARC, RRCs, Army  Reserve Regional Readiness Commands, Army Central Command, Army  and DOD military pay and personnel offices, Army Finance Command,  DFAS, and unit commanders and unit administrators to obtain an  understanding of their experiences in applying these policies and  procedures. From these interviews, we also obtained information on  examples of recent mobilized Army Reserve pay problems they  encountered in the course of their work. In addition, as part of our audit, we performed a review of selected edit and  validation checks in DJMS-RC. Specifically, we obtained documentation  and performed walk-throughs associated with DJMS-RC edits performed  on pay status/active duty change transactions, such as those to ensure that  tour start and stop dates matched MMPA dates and that the soldier cannot  be paid basic pay and allowances beyond the stop date that was entered  into DJMS-RC. We also obtained documentation on and performed walk- throughs of the recently implemented personnel-to-pay system interface  process, the order writing-to-pay system interface process, and on the  process for entering mobilization information into the pay system. We did  not independently test DOD\u2019s reported edit and validation checks in DJMS- RC, but we held interviews with officials from U.S. Army Reserve  Headquarters, Army Finance Command, and DFAS-Indianapolis to  supplement our documentation and walk-throughs. Because our preliminary assessment determined that current operations  used to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers relied extensively on error- prone manual entry of transactions into multiple, nonintegrated systems,  we did not statistically test current processes and controls. Instead, we  used a case study approach to provide a more detailed perspective of the  nature of any deficiencies in the three key areas of processes, people  (human capital), and automated systems relied on to pay mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers. Specifically, we gathered available data and analyzed the  pay experiences of Army Reserve soldiers mobilized to and demobilized  from active duty in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom,  and Iraqi Freedom during the period from August 2002 through January  2004. We audited the pay experiences of soldiers in the following eight  Army Reserve units as case studies of the effectiveness of the processes,  human capital practices, and automated systems in place over active duty  pays, allowances, and related tax benefits:  824th Quartermaster Company, Fort Bragg, N.C.   965th Dental Company, Seagoville, Tex.  948th Forward Surgical Team, Southfield, Mich.  443rd Military Police Company, Owings Mills, Md. FORSCOM Support Unit, Finksburg, Md.  629th Transportation Detachment, Fort Eustis, Va.  3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment, New Haven, Conn.  431st Chemical Detachment, Johnstown, Pa. From the population of Army Reserve units mobilized and demobilized  between August 2002 and January 2004, we selected units from various  specialties that represented the wide variety of missions performed by the  Army Reserve during wartime. These case studies are presented to provide  a more detailed view of the types and causes of any pay problems  experienced by these units as well as the financial impact of pay problems  on individual soldiers and their families. We used mobilization data supplied by the Army Reserve Headquarters  Operations Center to assist us in selecting the eight units we used as our  case studies. We did not independently verify the reliability of the  Operations Center database. We used the data to select RRCs that had a  large number of activated Reserve units that had mobilized, deployed, and  returned from their tour of active duty in support of Operations Noble  Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. From the list of units  assigned to these Readiness Commands, we selected our eight case studies  that had a variety of deployment locations and missions, including both  overseas and continental U.S. deployments. In addition to our case studies,  during our visits to Army mobilization locations, we interviewed small  numbers of soldiers currently in the process of returning from active duty  to obtain their perspectives on their experiences with active duty pays,  allowances, and related tax benefits. We also obtained testimonial data from soldiers at several of our case study  units. We asked numerous soldiers at these units to discuss pay-related  experiences during their deployment. The information we obtained during  these interviews is presented to provide further insight into the pay  experiences of Army Reserve soldiers who were mobilized under current  military operations, but is not intended to be representative of the views of  all soldiers in their units nor of those of Army Reserve soldiers overall. We used DJMS-RC pay transaction extracts for the period from August 2002  through January 2004 to identify pay problems associated with our case  study units. However, we did not perform an exact calculation of the net  pay soldiers should have received in comparison with what DJMS-RC  records show they received. Rather, we used available documentation and  follow-up inquiries with cognizant personnel at the Army Reserve  Command, Regional Readiness Commands, and the Reserve Pay Center at  Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, to determine if (1) soldiers\u2019 entitled active duty pay  and allowances were received within 30 days of their initial mobilization  date, (2) soldiers were paid within 30 days of the date they became eligible  for active duty pay, allowances, and entitlements associated with their  deployment locations, and (3) soldiers stopped receiving active duty pay  and allowances as of the date of their demobilization from active duty. For  the pay problems we identified, we counted them as problems only in the  phase (mobilization, deployment, and demobilization) in which they first  occurred even if the problems persisted into other phases. For purposes of  characterizing pay and allowance problems for this report, we defined  overpayments and underpayments as those that were in excess of  (overpayment) or less than (underpayment) the entitled payment. We  considered as late payments any active duty pay or allowance paid to the  soldier over 30 days after the date on which the soldier was entitled to  receive such payments. As such, these payments were those that, although  late, addressed a previously unpaid entitlement. We used available data  through February 2004, as well as dollar amounts reported by Reserve Pay  Center officials, to determine collections against identified overpayments  through February 2004. In addition, while we did not attempt to calculate  the exact impact of any soldier\u2019s over-, under-, and late payments on their  combat zone tax exclusion benefits, we did examine readily available data  to determine the extent to which our case study unit soldiers\u2019 received their  entitled combat zone tax exclusion benefits. Our audit results only reflect problems we identified. Soldiers in our case  study units may have experienced additional pay problems that we did not  identify. Further, our work was not designed to identify, and we did not  identify, any fraudulent pay and allowances to any mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. However, to the extent we identified any problems with our case  study unit soldiers\u2019 active duty pays, allowances, tax benefits, and related  collections, we provided documentation showing the results of our analysis  to appropriate Army Reserve officials for a complete review of all soldier  pay records to determine whether, and take appropriate action if,  additional amounts are owed to the Army Reserve soldiers or to the  government. We briefed officials of the DOD Comptroller, Army Finance Command,  Army Reserve Command, Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands,  Army Forces Command, and DFAS-Indianapolis on the details of our audit,  including our findings and their implications. On July 9, 2004, we requested  comments on a draft of this report. We received comments on August 11,  2004, from the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and have  summarized those comments in the section of this report entitled \u201cAgency  Comments and Our Evaluation.\u201d DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix X. We conducted our audit from November 2003 through June  2004 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing  standards. 824th Quartermaster Company, Fort Bragg,  North Carolina Beginning on February 2, 2003, the 824th Quartermaster Company was  called to active duty for up to a year in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom. A total of 68 soldiers from the 824th Quartermaster Company  mobilized at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and went through in-processing at  Fort Bragg\u2019s mobilization station in the first few weeks of February. Over  the next several months, members of the unit performed their mission of  rigging parachutes for individual soldiers and large equipment drops at Fort  Bragg, in Afghanistan, and in and around Kuwait. On April 6, 2003, 44  members of the 824th Quartermaster Company deployed to Kuwait to assist  in parachute preparations. After completing their mission, the soldiers  returned to Fort Bragg 2 months later on June 19. Another 5 soldiers from  the unit deployed to Afghanistan on July 14 and performed similar  parachute rigging duties, returning to Fort Bragg on September 1, 2003. The  other 19 soldiers in the unit remained at Fort Bragg for the entire duration  of their tour of duty where they assisted in parachute rigging at the base.  Beginning on July 15, 2003, soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company  began to demobilize and return to their civilian jobs, and by the end of  September 2003, all but one soldier had been released from active duty. The  soldier that remained on active duty was receiving medical treatment for  injuries related to his military service. A time line of actions associated  with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is shown in figure 3. As summarized in table 4, at every stage of the unit\u2019s tour of active duty,  soldiers experienced a variety of pay problems. Fifty-eight of the 68  soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company experienced at least one pay  problem associated with their activation to, during, or deactivation from  active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, (1) we  found that 11 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late  payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 50 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active  duty at Fort Bragg, in Afghanistan, and in and around Kuwait, including in- theater incentives such as hostile fire pay; and (3) 13 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, and/or late payments associated with their  demobilization, with most of the problems relating to the continuation of  active duty pay after demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments, underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $60,000, $10,000, and  $3,000, respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $2,000 was  subsequently collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers. Almost $18,000 of the  overpayments we identified was associated with one soldier, who  continued to receive active duty pay for more than 5 months after his  discharge from the Army. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 5, we found that 11 soldiers from the 824th  Quartermaster Company experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments related to basic pay and associated entitlements when called  to active duty. For example, we identified several soldiers who received  their $250 per month family separation allowance even though they  performed their military duty at Fort Bragg, their home station, and were  not separated from their families as provided by the DOD FMR Volume 7A.  The soldiers were not informed by pay technicians at the unit or their  mobilization station that they were not entitled to the family separation  allowance if their home of record was within a reasonable commuting  distance, generally 50 miles, even though the soldiers were staying at Fort  Bragg. Prior to being mobilized, the soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company  attended a SRP at their unit\u2019s home station. The purpose of this review was  to ensure that all soldiers had all required administrative paperwork,  financial documents, and were physically fit for the ensuing mobilization.  Members of the 81st Regional Readiness Command and unit members of the  824th Quartermaster Company, who conducted the finance portion of the  SRP, were required to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial  documentation, and, if necessary, submit transactions with the necessary  supporting documentation to the Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy to  update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay Accounts to reflect their mobilized  status. After performing the SRP at the unit\u2019s home station, the 824th  Quartermaster Company reported to Fort Bragg, its active Army  mobilization station. Fort Bragg personnel conducted a second SRP that  was intended, in part, to verify each soldier\u2019s pay account with supporting  finance documents. However, instead of conducting the required review of  each soldier\u2019s pay record, Fort Bragg\u2019s finance personnel performed only a  perfunctory review of the soldiers\u2019 supporting documents. According to  finance personnel at Fort Bragg\u2019s mobilization station, the physical layout  of the in-processing station did not allow them to sit with each soldier \u201cone  on one\u201d to compare their pay account as shown in DJMS-RC with the  soldier\u2019s pay supporting documentation in real time. The perfunctory review and oversights during the SRPs at the home station  and mobilization station allowed several soldiers to receive FSA when they  were not entitled to receive it. A review by personnel at the SRP should  have identified that the soldiers were not separated from their families as  required, and therefore they would not have signed off as approvers of the  entitlement forms. A lack of adequately trained staff with enough time to  review the unit\u2019s pay forms may have caused this pay error. Missing or noncurrent documentation required to support active duty pays  and allowances at the time of the SRP contributed to some of the late pays  and allowance payments we identified. For example, one soldier did not  receive family separation allowance payments because documentation  necessary to start this allowance was not submitted as part of the SRP  process, although the soldier was certified as ready for mobilization as a  result of the SRP. It was 6 months later, when the soldiers were  demobilizing at Fort Bragg, that the paperwork necessary to receive this  allowance was submitted to the Fort Bragg finance office. This soldier  received about 6 months of back pay in September 2003. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 6, we identified a number of problems associated  with the unit\u2019s active duty pays and allowances. During the soldiers\u2019 deployment to Afghanistan and Kuwait, they  encountered pay problems related to payments for soldiers located in  designated hardship duty locations and hostile fire zones. Most soldiers did  not receive the full amount of hardship duty pay payments while deployed.  In addition, they continued to receive their hardship duty pay well after  they had returned to Fort Bragg and demobilized. All 49 soldiers deployed  overseas were incorrectly paid for either hardship duty or hostile fire pay. Army area servicing finance officials, who had responsibility for initiating  these entitlements, did not initiate the unit\u2019s hardship duty pay payments  until several months after the unit had arrived. The delay resulted in the  deployed soldiers being underpaid for most of their time in the hardship  duty location. Local active Army finance officials also did not terminate payments of  hardship duty pay until 5 months after the soldiers had left the hardship  duty pay location, in most cases. This erroneous continuation of hardship  duty payments may have been the result of pay clerks continuing to  manually process these payments each month using a roster of soldiers in  the country that did not properly reflect the unit\u2019s departure from the  overseas deployment location. In addition, the DJMS-RC system processing  procedures in place at the time required that hardship duty pay be  processed using a miscellaneous payment code that could be used for a  variety of payments. The use of this miscellaneous code for hardship duty  pay precluded the system from identifying the payments as active duty pay  and therefore allowed these payments to continue after the soldiers were  demobilized. The use of the miscellaneous payment code also led to soldier  confusion because the Leave and Earning Statement did not identify the  nature of the entitlement. In addition, soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan told us that in some  cases, they had trouble finding in-theater finance officers willing to help  them with their pay problems. The soldiers stated that when they arrived in  Afghanistan, the finance office on duty at the time was preparing to return  to the United States because its tour in the country was ending. Several  weeks passed before the transition of finance offices was complete, and in  that time the Reserve soldiers did not have any local support that would  assist them with finance problems. This gap in a functioning supporting  finance office for the deployed soldiers could only have added to their  frustration and confusion over in-theater pays. In addition to the problems soldiers experienced related to their pay and  entitlements, they also experienced systematic problems related to their  combat zone tax exclusion benefits. All 49 of the soldiers from the 824th  Quartermaster Company who deployed overseas were eligible for this tax  benefit and all of them experienced some type of problem with their  combat zone tax exclusion. Specifically, we found that all 49 soldiers  received their combat zone tax exclusion late, totaling about $20,000. Five  soldiers did not receive all of the combat zone tax exclusion benefits they  were due during their deployment. Moreover, the soldiers who deployed to  Afghanistan did not have the combat zone tax exclusion applied to their  pay until nearly 3 months after they arrived in the country, and never  received their combat zone tax exclusion benefit for September 2003. The  error for the month of September caused over $1,300 of extra taxes to be  collected from these soldiers while in a combat zone. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Soldiers of the 824th Quartermaster Company began to demobilize in July  2003. As summarized in table 7, during their demobilization and after their  release from active duty, soldiers continued to experience pay problems.  These problems were primarily overpayments associated with soldiers  receiving pay after their active duty demobilization dates. The largest pay problem related to the 824th Quartermaster Company\u2019s  demobilization involved a soldier who was put into a medical hold  company. The soldier initially mobilized with the unit in February, and was  in-processed by personnel at Fort Bragg. During the in-processing, it was  determined that the soldier had a medical condition that did not allow him  to mobilize with the unit and perform his duty. He was then transferred to a  medical holding company under the command of the Fort Bragg Garrison  Support Unit. In this unit, the soldier underwent treatment for his condition  and concluded that treatment in August 2003. On August 13, 2003, the  soldier was discharged entirely from the Army and his pay should have  stopped on that date. According to DFAS guidance, several locations can  initiate transactions to stop a soldier\u2019s pay. The primary location is the  demobilization station where the soldier receives his or her DD Form 214,  Certificate of Discharge or Release from Active Duty. As a secondary catch,  the Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy can also stop the soldier\u2019s pay on his  or her release date. Although the soldier did out-process through Fort Bragg and received his  DD Form 214, personnel at the demobilization station at Fort Bragg did not  amend the soldier\u2019s pay record to cut off pay on August 13. The unit also  did not take any action to stop the soldier\u2019s pay because the soldier should  have been off of its pay records and in the pay records of the medical hold  company. This had not been done and the result was that the medical hold  company could not view the soldier\u2019s pay records but knew he was  discharged. Meanwhile, the unit could view the pay records but, under  current procedures, did not receive a copy of the DD Form 214 showing the  soldier had been discharged. Ultimately, the soldier\u2019s pay and allowances  were stopped only as a result of actions we took. Specifically, in August  2003, the soldier contacted his old unit, the 824th Quartermaster Company,  and faxed them a copy of his DD Form 214. At this point the unit had all  necessary documentation to identify the overpayment to the soldier after  his discharge date of August 13, but did not review the pay records and  identify the problem. The soldier continued to get paid until the end of  January 2004 when we identified the error, which resulted in an  overpayment of almost $18,000. Finally, after we brought the error to the  unit\u2019s attention, the unit requested that the Reserve Pay Center at Fort  McCoy stop the soldier\u2019s pay and initiate collection. 965th Dental Company Seagoville, Texas On February 9, 2003, the 965th Dental Company was called to active duty in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom for an initial 1-year tour. The unit  mobilized at its home station, Seagoville, Texas, on February 11, 2003, and  reported for active duty at Fort Hood, Texas, on February 14, 2003. On  March 23, 2003, the 965th Dental Company deployed to Camp Arifjan,  Kuwait, to provide dental services to Army soldiers involved in military  operations in Iraq and surrounding areas. Upon completion of its mission,  the company redeployed from Kuwait to Fort Hood in two separate groups;  the first group returned on May 22, 2003, and the second on June 10, 2003.  Within a few days of returning to Fort Hood, soldiers were sent home and  following end-of-tour leave were discharged from active duty. By the end of  July 2003, all but three soldiers had been released from active duty. Two  soldiers remained on active duty because they were still receiving medical  treatment for injuries sustained during their deployment and one was still  deployed overseas at the time of our review. A time line of actions  associated with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is shown in figure 4. As summarized in table 8, soldiers of the 965th Dental Company  experienced various pay problems at every stage of the unit\u2019s tour of active  duty. Overall, 89 of 93 mobilized soldiers experienced some type of pay  problem associated with their activation to, during, or deactivation from,  active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, 25  soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late payments  associated with their initial mobilization; 86 experienced underpayments,  overpayments, or late payments during their deployment to areas in and  around Kuwait, including in-theater incentives such as hostile fire pay and  hardship duty pay; and 7 soldiers experienced underpayments or  overpayments associated with their demobilization, including problems  related to the continuation of active duty pay after demobilization. One  soldier received $36,000 of active duty pay even though he never mobilized  with the unit. Another soldier incorrectly received hostile fire pay, hardship  duty pay, the family separation allowance, and the combat zone tax  exclusion benefit following his return home to recuperate from injuries  sustained overseas. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments, underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $100,000, $16,000, and  $27,000, respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $400 was  subsequently collected from the soldiers prior to the time we started our  audit. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 9, we found that 25 soldiers from the 965th Dental  Company experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late payments  related to basic pay and associated entitlements during mobilization  processing. The unit administrator conducted a premobilization SRP review during  October 2002 at the unit\u2019s home station. However, according to the unit  administrator, about 30 to 40 soldiers did not attend the SRP session  because the soldiers would have had to travel from distant locations, such  as Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they typically attended Army Reserve  inactive duty training, or for other reasons. Thus, when these soldiers  arrived at the unit\u2019s home station prior to reporting to Fort Hood, the unit  administrator quickly performed the SRP process for them at that time.  However, instead of submitting necessary changes to soldiers\u2019 pay  accounts to the Reserve Pay Center, the unit administrator waited until the  unit arrived at the Fort Hood mobilization station to submit them.  According to documentation obtained from the Reserve Pay Center, some  soldiers\u2019 documentation was not submitted until March 22, 2003, a month  after the unit was mobilized. As a result, promotion pay increases and other  entitlements were paid over 2 months late. For 3 soldiers, correct  entitlements were not received until the soldiers returned from their  overseas tour. Delays in submitting required forms and documentation were the primary  causes for late pay and entitlements. Also, three soldiers were overpaid pay  and benefits because their active duty pay was started too early. These  minor overpayments were collected from the soldiers\u2019 pay during  demobilization out-processing. One soldier received double the amount of  basic allowance for housing, for an estimated overpayment of $6,600. In  addition, the process of paying soldiers their family separation allowance  was not consistently applied for the soldiers of the 965th Dental Company.  For example, a soldier from Gulfport, Mississippi, was paid family  separation allowance during his commute to the mobilization station;  however, a soldier from Claremore, Oklahoma, was not. The lack of accountability for deploying soldiers resulted in one unit  soldier being paid active duty pay even though the soldier never mobilized  with the unit. This soldier received orders to mobilize with the unit, but  because the soldier had a disability that prevented his serving on active  duty, the unit commander excused the soldier from mobilization. However,  although unit personnel transferred the soldier to another unit that was not  mobilizing, no one canceled the soldier\u2019s original mobilization order in the  Army Reserve personnel system, or notified the Reserve Pay Center to stop  the soldier\u2019s active duty pay. In addition, unit personnel did not notify the  Fort Hood mobilization station that this soldier had received a mobilization  order so the mobilization station could confirm that the order had been  revoked and stop pay for this soldier. Further, the soldier receiving the  unauthorized pay did not report the overpayments to the unit to which he  had been transferred. Thus, the soldier received approximately $36,000 of  active duty pay for which he was not entitled. These overpayments  continued for more than 12 months and were not identified until we  discovered them during our visit to the unit in January 2004. During our visit to the home station, we informed the unit commander  about the soldier\u2019s overpayment and he stated that this soldier should not  be held responsible for repaying the overpayment because he believed the  soldier did nothing wrong or illegal. He also stated that he did not review  the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report because the soldiers were  able to review their pay online. It is likely that the improper payments to  this soldier would have been identified if either the unit commander or unit  administrator had monitored the unit\u2019s pay reports. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 10, we identified extensive problems associated  with active duty pays and allowances applicable to the unit\u2019s overseas  deployment to Kuwait. In total, 86 soldiers experienced some type of pay  problem during the deployed phase, including one soldier who did not  deploy overseas, but received in-theatre incentives. During the unit\u2019s deployment to Kuwait, soldiers encountered pay  problems related to hardship duty pay, hostile fire pay, and the combat  zone tax exclusion, all of which are benefits eligible to soldiers when  serving in designated hardship duty locations and hostile fire zones. All 85  of the soldiers deployed overseas were incorrectly paid for either hardship  duty pay or hostile fire pay, most of which were overpayments. In total, 85 soldiers did not receive the full amount of their hardship duty  pay entitlement while deployed to Kuwait. These soldiers were underpaid a  total of about $8,000. In addition, 76 soldiers continued to receive hardship  duty pay payments following their return from Kuwait. Sixty-six of these  soldiers continued receiving the payments for 6 or more months following  their return home. Overpayments made to all 76 soldiers amounted to  approximately $46,500. This amount does not include the overpayments  made to soldiers involving a type of hardship duty pay that is no longer paid  to soldiers serving in Kuwait. In addition, we estimated that the combat zone tax exclusion benefit was  applied to 76 soldiers late or incorrectly. We estimated that approximately  75 soldiers received their combat zone tax relief benefits 2 to 3 months late,  which was after their deployment ended, totally $24,000. In addition, one  soldier did not receive all of the combat zone tax exclusion benefits she  was due during her deployment, resulting in an estimated $200  underpayment, while 2 other soldiers were overpaid for a combined  overpayment of about $300. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Soldiers of the 965th Dental Company returned to Fort Hood in two  different groups; the first group returned on May 22, 2003, and the second  group returned on June 10, 2003. As summarized in table 11, 7 of 93 soldiers  had problems associated with properly stopping their active duty pays and  allowances during their demobilization. Of the soldiers who experienced pay problems associated with this phase,  most had underpayments. One of the soldiers we reviewed had his active  duty pay stopped before his actual demobilization date and another  soldier\u2019s special medical pay was stopped a month early. Each soldier was  underpaid an estimated $1,200. Another soldier\u2019s active duty pay continued  past his demobilization date for an overpayment of approximately $1,400. In addition, one soldier returned home early from deployment in May 2003  due to a medical emergency. However, his pay and entitlements were not  adjusted correctly. As a result, during his convalescence, much of which  was at his home, the soldier continued to receive hardship duty pay, hostile  fire pay, the family separation allowance, and the combat zone tax  exclusion through April 2004 when we brought the overpayments to the  unit\u2019s attention. 948th Forward Surgical Team, Southfield,  Michigan On January 20, 2003, the 948th Medical Detachment Forward Surgical (948th  Forward Surgical Team) was mobilized to active duty in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom for a 1-year tour. A total of 20 soldiers from  the 948th Forward Surgical Team, including four surgeons, mobilized at its  home station in Southfield, Michigan, and went through in-processing at  the mobilization station at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. On February 28, 2003,  the unit deployed to Afghanistan through Baghram Air Base, Afghanistan.  Most of the 20 soldiers remained in Kandahar for about 5 months. While  there, the unit provided emergency medical attention to wounded soldiers  and civilians in and around Kandahar and prepared them for evacuation to  a combat support hospital. Two surgeons from the team returned in June  2003 and a third soldier returned in July 2003 as a result of a medical  condition and was released from active duty on September 27, 2003.  Sixteen of the remaining 17 soldiers returned to Fort McCoy on August 5,  2003, for demobilization and were released from active duty by August 29,  2003. The 948th Forward Surgical Team\u2019s commander remained in  Afghanistan until August 8, 2003, when he returned to Fort McCoy for  demobilization and was released from active duty on September 4, 2003. A  time line of the unit\u2019s movements associated with its mobilization under  Operation Enduring Freedom is shown in figure 5. All 20 soldiers in the 948th Forward Surgical Team experienced one or more  pay problems associated with their 2003 mobilization to active duty. As  summarized in table 12, soldiers in the 948th Forward Surgical Team  experienced pay problems during all phases of their active duty  mobilization, with the majority of the problems encountered in the last two  phases. Specifically, we identified pay problems associated with (1) basic  active duty pay, special medical pays, or allowances for 5 soldiers during  the mobilization phase; (2) basic active duty pay, special medical pays,  allowances, combat zone tax exclusion, or an in-theater incentive pay  associated with the deployment phase for 20 soldiers; and (3) basic active  duty pay, special medical pays, or allowances associated with 18 soldiers\u2019  demobilization from active duty. In total, the pay problems we identified resulted in estimated overpayments  of about $20,700, underpayments of about $2,000, and late payments of  about $5,600. In addition, we identified about $15,300 and about $130 of  combat zone tax exclusions that were delayed or not refunded,  respectively. Available records showed that about $2,300 of the $20,700 in  identified overpayments were subsequently collected from the soldiers. We were informed of several instances in which the unit\u2019s pay problems  created financial hardships for the unit\u2019s soldiers and their families.  Specifically, several of the unit\u2019s soldiers could not pay their bills while they  were deployed and were forced to borrow money from friends and  relatives in order to meet their financial obligations. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 13, we found that five soldiers from the 948th  Forward Surgical Team experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late  payments related to their active duty pay and allowances associated with  their initial mobilization. Five soldiers experienced a variety of pay problems associated with their  mobilization to active duty. For example, one physician was underpaid the  special medical pay he was entitled to receive while on active duty. In  January 2003, the physician began receiving special medical payments at a  rate lower than he was entitled to receive. In March 2003, DFAS identified  and corrected this error by paying the physician the correct special medical  pay. However, DFAS did not retroactively pay the physician the correct  medical pay covering the first 39 days he was on active duty. Another soldier experienced a problem related to his basic pay. The soldier  had previously received a reduction in rank for not completing training  requirements. On February 12, 2003, the commanding officer signed an  order revoking the reduction in rank\u2014after the unit was mobilized to  active duty, but before it was deployed to Afghanistan. The Reserve Pay  Center received the revocation order on March 7, 2003, but did not process  this personnel action until April 4, 2003, resulting in late payments totaling  an estimated $520. Deployment Pay  Problems In late February 2003, the 948th Forward Surgical Team left Fort McCoy and  traveled to Afghanistan. While in Kandahar, the soldiers experienced  further pay problems related to hardship duty pay, hostile fire pay, and to a  lesser extent, active duty basic pay, basic allowance for housing, family  separation allowance, and special medical pays. They also experienced  problems with respect to their benefits associated with the combat zone  tax exclusion. Table 14 summarizes the pay, allowance, and tax benefit  problems that the 948th Forward Surgical Team encountered during its  deployment. We found that 19 of the 20 soldiers did not receive their initial hostile fire  pay of $150 for February until an average of 47 days after arriving in  Afghanistan. We also found that one soldier never received her initial  hostile fire pay for February and March totaling $300. She also never  received a retroactive hostile fire payment of $75 for February 2003. All 20 soldiers experienced problems with their hardship duty pay.  Nineteen of the 20 soldiers did not receive their hardship duty pay for  February 2003 until April 2003. For 13 of the 19 soldiers, their February  2003 hardship duty payment was not only late but contained an  overpayment because the payments covered a period when the soldiers  were still at Fort McCoy. Additionally, 19 soldiers continued to receive  hardship duty payments not only after they left the location for which they  were authorized to receive this pay, but for periods ranging from 1 to 5  months following demobilization. All 20 soldiers waited 67 days before receiving their February combat zone  tax exclusion benefit payment, which averaged $377. We also found that  one soldier was not refunded the total amount of taxes withheld while in  combat zone tax exclusion status. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Eighteen of 20 soldiers in the 948th Forward Surgical Team experienced pay  problems associated with their demobilization from active duty. Seventeen  of the unit\u2019s soldiers returned to Fort McCoy in August 2003 to begin their  demobilization process. The other 3 left Afghanistan and returned to Fort  McCoy in June and July 2003. As summarized in table 15, soldiers were  overpaid their active duty basic pay, certain allowances, and special  medical pays after their release from active duty, while others never  received (and were therefore underpaid) all of the family separation  allowance or special medical pays they were entitled to receive. We determined that 16 soldiers received 1 or more days worth of active  duty basic pay, special medical pays, or allowances after being released  from active duty. These pay problems occurred because the demobilization  station was late in entering transactions to stop pays and allowances as of  the date the soldiers were released from active duty. 443rd Military Police Company, Owings Mills,  Maryland The 443rd Military Police Company, headquartered in Owings Mills,  Maryland, has been called to active duty twice since September 11, 2001.  However, only the second mobilization fell within the time period of our  case study analysis. The first mobilization (October 6, 2001, to September  2002) activated 112 soldiers to perform \u201csecure and defend\u201d functions at  Fort Sam Houston in support of Operation Noble Eagle. On February 24,  2003, 121 soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company were mobilized with  the unit, including 76 who had returned from the deployment to Fort Sam  Houston 5 months prior to this mobilization and 25 soldiers who were  cross-leveled in from other units. These cross-leveled soldiers included 12  soldiers from Puerto Rico, 7 soldiers from Pennsylvania, 3 soldiers from  Maryland, and 1 soldier each from New Jersey, Virginia, and West Virginia. In support of Operation Enduring Freedom, soldiers from the 443rd Military  Police Company reported to the home station in Owings Mills for a SRP  designed to help prepare them for mobilization. They later reported to Fort  Lee, Virginia on February 27, 2003, for additional mobilization and in- processing procedures. After approximately 2.5 months at Fort Lee, 112  soldiers arrived in Iraq on May 15. Of the 9 remaining soldiers, 1 soldier  arrived in Iraq earlier, on May 14, 1 soldier arrived on September 16, and 7  were on medical hold at Fort Lee for the entire mobilization. While in- theater, the 443rd Military Police Company operated a prison, Camp  Cropper, located near the Baghdad airport. On December 6, 2003, 112 of the  114 soldiers who deployed to Iraq left the Middle East and returned to Fort  Lee. One of the 2 other soldiers left early\u2014on August 17\u2014and the other left  later\u2014on December 14. The soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company  began demobilizing and returning to their civilian jobs on December 15. By  January 15, 2004, all but 6 of the 121 soldiers had demobilized; the 6  soldiers remained on active duty to receive medical treatment at Fort Lee.  A time line of actions associated with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is  shown in figure 6. As summarized in table 16, soldiers experienced a range of pay problems at  every stage of the 443rd Military Police Company\u2019s tour of active duty.  Overall, 119 of 121 soldiers who mobilized experienced some type of pay  problem associated with their activation to, during, or deactivation from  federal service in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, we  found that (1) 70 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 114 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active  duty at Camp Cropper, Iraq; and (3) 17 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their  demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments, underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $25,000, $15,000 and  $20,000, respectively. In addition, soldiers received late payment of their  combat zone tax exclusion benefit totaling about $33,000. Of the  overpayments we identified, about $4,000 were subsequently collected  from the unit\u2019s soldiers. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 17, we found that 67 soldiers from the 443rd Military  Police Company experienced overpayments, underpayments, or late  payments related to basic pay and the associated entitlements when called  to active duty. Before arriving at the mobilization station, the 99th Regional Readiness  Command performed a SRP for the 443rd Military Police Company at their  home station. This review was designed to prepare soldiers for  mobilization by confirming that their financial documents and personnel  paperwork were in order, as well as verifying that the soldiers were  medically fit to mobilize. The finance portion of the SRP consisted of a  briefing that covered the different entitlements soldiers could expect to  receive and a review of how to read the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay  Accounts. Soldiers who found errors in their individual accounts were  supposed to notify the Regional Readiness Command\u2019s finance personnel  at the SRP, who would then process the corrections upon returning to their  headquarters and send the necessary documentation to Fort McCoy\u2019s  Reserve Pay Center. Upon reporting to Fort Lee, the 443rd Military Police Company\u2019s active  Army mobilization station, the unit underwent a second SRP, as required by  Army regulations. However, despite going through two SRPs, the soldiers  still experienced various pay problems related to their mobilization. For example, not all of the eligible soldiers in the 443rd Military Police  Company received the proper amount of family separation allowance.  Many of the unit\u2019s soldiers began receiving family separation allowance  earlier than they should have, resulting in small overpayments that totaled  approximately $550 for the unit. In addition, 15 soldiers received late family  separation allowance payments during mobilization. In addition, the soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company also had  difficulties in starting their basic allowance for housing entitlements and  active duty basic pay. Ten soldiers experienced overpayments and 6  soldiers experienced underpayments of their basic allowance for housing. The 12 soldiers cross-leveled into the 443rd Military Police Company from  Puerto Rico were not entitled to the basic allowance for housing type I  during their mobilization because they were classified as overseas soldiers.  Instead, these soldiers received basic allowance for housing type II, a cost  of living allowance and an overseas housing allowance. One soldier  received an overpayment of the cost of living allowance and 2 soldiers  received underpayments of their overseas housing allowance entitlements,  all of which occurred because these payments were based on incorrect  rates. Four members of the unit experienced problems starting their active duty  basic pay. Two soldiers received a delay in their promotions, resulting in  nearly $500 in late payments. The two other soldiers had received  demotions that were not promptly entered into DJMS-RC. The first soldier\u2019s  demotion had been effective at the start of the mobilization, but the soldier  continued to receive payments at the incorrect, higher rate until July 2003.  The resulting overpayments of active duty basic pay, totaling over $2,500,  were not identified by the Reserve Pay Center until we raised questions  about them. The second soldier, however, incurred almost $6,400 in collections when  his demotion was processed 16 months after it became effective, and  despite the fact that his higher rank was restored shortly thereafter. His  demotion occurred because he had been unable to attend training to  maintain his rank before being mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle in  October 2001. During this mobilization, in February 2002, Army personnel  at the 99th Regional Readiness Command generated a grade reduction  order, but the transaction was not entered into DJMS-RC until June 2003, 4  months after the soldier\u2019s mobilization for Operation Enduring Freedom  and after his deployment to Iraq. Although his previous grade was restored  in July 2003, the restoration was not retroactive, so the soldier still had to  pay back almost $6,400. One problem that occurred during the mobilization process did not have an  immediate effect on the soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company, but  rather later, during their deployment. In October 2003, 20 soldiers had their  basic allowance for housing switched from the regular entitlement to the  partial basic allowance for housing. In addition, another 16 soldiers had  their family separation allowance entitlements stopped. These changes  occurred because during the SRP process in February, finance personnel  failed to extend the dates of eligibility for the basic allowance for housing  and the family separation allowance to reflect the end date of the current  mobilization. Pay records showed that these 36 soldiers were entitled to  receive one of these entitlements through October 2003, exactly 2 years  after the date of the first mobilization. While the soldiers were paid for  active duty beyond the October end date of eligibility in the system, the  allowances were automatically turned off by the system. Most of these  problems were caught shortly after occurring and were corrected by the  end of the following month, resulting in about $5,750 of late payments.  However, 4 soldiers failed to have their entitlements turned back on,  resulting in total underpayments of $3,500. Soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company complained that finance  personnel at Fort Lee in March refused to help them and told soldiers that  they needed to contact their unit administrator to fix their problems. The  unit administrator, who did not mobilize with the unit, voluntarily went to  Fort Lee to help ensure that all of the Company\u2019s soldiers\u2019 pay issues were  addressed. However, finance personnel at Fort Lee asked him to leave after  he attempted to help resolve some of his unit\u2019s pay problems. Despite  spending over 2 months at Fort Lee, many of the pay problems that began  during mobilization were not corrected by the time the soldiers deployed to  Iraq. In fact, 52 of the 121 soldiers left the mobilization station with  unresolved pay-related problems. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 18, we identified a number of pay problems  associated with active duty pays and allowances during the 443rd Military  Police Company\u2019s deployment while on active duty. While deployed in Iraq, all of the soldiers experienced problems related to  the location-based payments\u2014specifically, problems with hardship duty  pay, hostile fire pay, and the combat zone tax exclusion. All of the 114  soldiers deployed to Iraq with the 443rd Military Police Company  experienced some sort of overpayment, underpayment, or late payment of  at least one of these three entitlements. Soldiers in the 443rd Military Police Company were entitled to $100 per  month for hardship duty pay for serving in Iraq. However, officials at the  Army area servicing finance office paid the first partial month\u2019s hardship  duty pay more than 2 months after it was due to 107 of the 114 soldiers  deployed to Iraq. Of the remaining 7 soldiers, 4 received hardship duty pay  on time and 3 never received the first partial month\u2019s hardship duty pay  during our audit period. Additionally, none of the 113 soldiers remaining in  Iraq during December 2003 received any hardship duty pay payments for  the partial month they spent in-theater. Soldiers in the unit also  experienced assorted individual problems relating to the payment of the  hardship duty pay entitlement. For example, 1 soldier who remained on  medical hold at Fort Lee received hardship duty pay payments, totaling  over $350, despite never deploying. Two soldiers each received two  hardship duty pay payments in a given month, resulting in over $150 in  overpayments. Finally, one soldier continued to receive over $300 in  hardship duty pay payments after leaving Iraq in August 2003. Of the 113 soldiers entitled to hostile fire pay during the deployment, 3  experienced some sort of problem with this pay. Two soldiers received  overpayments of hostile fire pay, including 1 soldier who continued to  receive hostile fire pay after he left the in-theater location and another  soldier who erroneously received $300 in hostile fire pay instead of the  correct $225 amount for 1 month. This second soldier also received part of  his May 2003 hostile fire pay 75 days after it was due. Finally, 1 other soldier  experienced a $450 underpayment of hostile fire pay because he stopped  receiving the entitlement before leaving Iraq. Of the 114 soldiers deployed to Iraq, 112 received their first month\u2019s combat  zone tax exclusion more than 30 days after they were entitled to it. This  resulted in late payments totaling over $33,000, more than the late  payments from all other sources combined. Additionally, 3 soldiers  experienced overpayments and underpayments related to the combat zone  tax exclusion. One of these soldiers erroneously received over $250 as a  combat zone tax exclusion repayment related to a bonus payment that was  taxable. Another soldier did not receive his combat zone tax exclusion  repayment for the last 2 months of his mobilization, creating an  overwithholding of over $400. We were unable to determine the extent to which one additional soldier in  the unit experienced problems with his combat zone tax exclusion,  hardship duty pay, and hostile fire pay during the mobilization. His DD  Form 214, Certificate of Release and Discharge from Active Duty, stated  that the soldier served with his unit in theater from May 15, 2003, to  December 6, 2003. However, the soldier did not receive any of these  location-based entitlements during his tour of duty. Pay personnel at Fort  McCoy stated that his records indicate he was on convalescent leave (leave  for soldiers returning to duty after illness or injury) from May 21 to July 16,  and therefore may not have been entitled to these allowances. Pay  personnel at Fort McCoy were continuing to research this case and could  not tell us anything further. Without additional information, we could not  determine whether this soldier was paid correctly. In addition, during this phase, some of the soldiers of the 443rd Military  Police Company also experienced various individual problems with active  duty basic pay, the basic allowance for housing, and the overseas housing  allowance. Because of delays in promotions, six soldiers experienced late  payments of active duty basic pay and four of these soldiers also  experienced late payments of basic allowance for housing. Other problems  included one soldier who received overpayments of the basic allowance for  housing throughout the mobilization, totaling over $850, because her  spouse was a service member who periodically went on and off duty. Two  other soldiers had their overseas housing allowance paid inconsistently  and at varying rates, creating net overpayments for both soldiers. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty The soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company began to demobilize in  December 2003. As summarized in table 19, some soldiers continued to  experience pay problems throughout their demobilization and even after  release from active duty. These problems consisted primarily of differences  between the last dates for which soldiers were paid and the dates of release  from active duty as recorded on the DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or  Discharge from Active Duty. Of the 115 soldiers who demobilized by the end of our audit period,  including 2 who had been on medical hold, 6 soldiers were paid beyond  their date of demobilization and 2 soldiers had their pay stopped shortly  before demobilizing. The 6 soldiers paid beyond their date of  demobilization were overpaid for an average of 19 days and nearly $2,500  each. This includes 1 soldier who was overpaid for at least 68 days and  $10,500. This soldier, who demobilized in February 2004, stated that he  contacted his demobilization station, home unit, and the pay section of the  Regional Readiness Command by early April, but nevertheless continued to  be paid through April 2004. The 2 soldiers whose pays were stopped before  demobilizing were underpaid a total of almost $400. In addition to the problems associated with the date of release from active  duty, several soldiers experienced other problems related to their  demobilization. For example, the demobilization station processed  \u201chardship duty pay for certain places\u201d for 1 soldier from May 2003 to  December 2003. This type of hardship duty pay has not been authorized for  newly deployed soldiers since December 2001 and the soldier had received  his correct \u201chardship duty pay for designated areas\u201d while he was deployed  in Iraq. This erroneous transaction during the soldier\u2019s out-processing  created an overpayment of approximately $150 that went undetected.  Additionally, 7 of the 12 soldiers cross-leveled into the 443rd Military Police  Company from Puerto Rico experienced late payments of their last month\u2019s  overseas housing allowance entitlement, totaling almost $1,500. FORSCOM Support Unit, Finksburg, Maryland A major in the Army\u2019s Individual Ready Reserve, who lives in Maryland,  volunteered for active duty. He received orders mobilizing him to active  duty on March 6, 2003, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The major  was activated as a separate one-person unit. Because he was mobilized  from an inactive status, he did not have a home unit. He reported to Fort  McPherson, Georgia, on March 6, 2003, where he participated in an Army  SRP. On March 9, 2003, he reported to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for  training. Because he was to serve as an Army liaison to the Air Force while  deployed, on March 17, 2003, he reported to Seymour Johnson Air Force  base in North Carolina, where he underwent an Air Force mobilization in- processing review with the Air Force\u2019s 4th Fighter Wing. He arrived in Qatar  on March 25, 2003. He was assigned to serve as an Army Forces Command  (FORSCOM) Ground Liaison Officer attached to the Air Force\u2019s 379th  Expeditionary Force at the Air Force base at Doha, Qatar. As a Ground  Liaison Officer, he was responsible for a team of Army officers that briefed  Air Force pilots before every mission during the Iraqi offensive on the latest  information concerning the location of Army troops and enemy forces. He  was also responsible for providing briefings to the Air Force general in  charge of flight operations at Doha on the status and positions of coalition  ground forces. He served in this capacity until May 1, 2003, when he left  Qatar. On May 2, 2003, he underwent Air Force active duty outprocessing  with the Air Force\u2019s 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.  He arrived at Fort McPherson on May 4, 2003, for demobilization  processing. He was demobilized from active duty on May 15, 2003, and  returned to his home in an inactive status as a member of the Army\u2019s  Individual Ready Reserve. In August 2003, the major resigned his  commission and received an honorable discharge from the Army Reserve.  Key events associated with the major\u2019s active duty pays and allowances for  his 2003 mobilization are summarized in figure 7. As summarized in table 20, this one-soldier unit experienced various pay  problems associated with his location-based active duty pays and  allowances that continued until well after his demobilization to Individual  Ready Reserve status. Specifically, we found that this single-soldier unit (1)  did not have any underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during  initial mobilization; (2) experienced overpayments and late payments  associated with deployment location-based pays, allowances, and related  tax benefits; and (3) continued to experience problems with active duty  pays, allowances, and related tax benefits for months after his  demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments and late payments we  identified were about $8,000 and $300, respectively. Of the overpayments  we identified, all were subsequently collected from the soldier by May 31,  2004. Mobilization Pay  Problems Finance personnel at the soldier\u2019s mobilization station at Fort McPherson,  Georgia, started his active duty pay entitlements associated with his initial  mobilization. We did not identify any pay problems associated with the  soldier\u2019s initial mobilization to active duty. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 21, we identified active duty pay and combat zone  tax benefit problems associated with the soldier\u2019s assigned deployment  location while on active duty. When the soldier arrived at his assigned  active duty deployment location in Qatar on March 25, 2003, he was entitled  to receive hardship duty pay and was entitled to exempt his pay from  federal taxes while assigned to that location. However, while the soldier  went through an Air Force in-processing procedure when he arrived in  Qatar, there were no procedures in place to provide flight manifest  documentation to an Army area servicing finance office notifying it of his  arrival. Such documentation is necessary to start the soldier\u2019s hostile fire  pay and related combat zone tax exclusion benefits. Because he was  assigned to support an Air Force operation, he did not process through, or  have any access to, an Army area servicing finance office to start his  location-based pays and related tax benefits. It was not until he left Qatar  and arrived at his demobilization station at Fort McPherson that finance  personnel at that location received supporting documentation from the  soldier and took the actions necessary to process transactions for him to  receive his pay and tax benefit entitlements. Consequently, he did not  receive any of his hostile fire pay until May 21, 2003, or his related combat  zone tax exclusion benefits until June 4, 2003\u2014after he returned from his  overseas deployment. Army finance officials did not initiate the soldier\u2019s hostile fire pay and  combat zone tax exclusion benefit, which he was entitled to receive  beginning in March 2003, until officials at his demobilization station took  action to start this pay and tax benefit. The soldier was deployed to serve  as an Army liaison to an Air Force unit with an Air Force finance office; he  was unable to find anyone at or near his deployed location who could help  him get his entitled location-based pay and related tax benefits started. Air  Force finance personnel told the soldier to contact finance personnel back  in the United States at Fort McPherson to address his pay problems. The  soldier told us that while he was in Qatar he was able to contact DFAS by e- mail, but officials there told him there was little they could do to help him  get his location-based pays and tax benefits started. He said that telephone  calls to the United States were difficult because of time differences and his  limited access to phones to make an overseas call. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty The soldier left Qatar on May 1, 2003, to return to his demobilization station  at Fort McPherson. Fort McPherson issued orders to demobilize him from  active duty to the Army\u2019s Individual Ready Reserve as of May 15, 2003. As  summarized in table 22, during his demobilization and after his release  from active duty, the soldier continued to experience pay problems. These  problems were overpayments associated with the soldier receiving active  duty pay after the date of his demobilization from active duty. The soldier out-processed through Fort McPherson and received his DD  Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, with a  release from active duty date of May 15, 2003. However, finance personnel  at the Fort McPherson demobilization station did not take action to stop his  active duty pays and allowances as of that date. As a result, he continued to  receive active duty pays and allowances that he was not entitled to receive  for a month after his demobilization\u2014from May 16 through June 13, 2003.  In addition, he continued to receive his combat zone tax exclusion benefits  for the same period, May 16 through June 13, even though he had not only  left the combat zone, but had already demobilized from active duty and  returned home. The income tax withholdings for this period were refunded  directly to the soldier. His pay was not stopped at the end of his active duty  tour initially because finance personnel at Fort McPherson were waiting  for his hardship duty pays to \u201cclear,\u201d but they then forgot to stop all pays  related to active duty. This failure to stop the soldier\u2019s active duty pays and allowances on time  resulted in the soldier writing a $6,150.75 check to DFAS in an attempt to  resolve all overpayment issues associated with his mobilization. As  summarized in table 23, the soldier undertook a series of time-consuming  phone calls and faxes to Fort McPherson, DFAS-Indianapolis, DFAS- Denver, and DFAS-Cleveland over a 13-month period to finally get his pay  issues resolved. Ultimately, the soldier\u2019s pay issues related to his March and  April 2003 active duty deployment were only identified and resolved  through the relentless efforts of the soldier and our inquiries into the  matter. With the soldier\u2019s recent $1,140.54 check to DFAS, his pay issues  with his March and April 2003 mobilization were resolved\u2014over a year  after his deployment ended. The 629th Transportation Detachment was called to active duty in support  of Operation Enduring Freedom on March 15, 2003, for a period not to  exceed 365 days. Twenty-seven soldiers with the 629th Transportation  Detachment received orders to mobilize; but only 24 soldiers actually  deployed with the unit. The unit arrived at its home station, Fort Eustis,  Virginia, on March 15, 2003, where it began the SRP in-processing. On  March 18, 2003, the soldiers continued their mobilization processing at Fort  Eustis, Virginia, which was also their designated mobilization station. The  unit remained at Fort Eustis for approximately 2 months undergoing  additional in-processing and training. On May 22, 2003, the 629th  Transportation Detachment was deployed to Kuwait and was assigned  responsibility for tracking supplies in and out of Army field locations in and  around Kuwait. After completing its assigned mission, the unit left Kuwait  on December 5, 2003, to return to its demobilization station. By the end of  January 2004, all of the soldiers were released from active duty with the  exception of 1 soldier who was placed on medical hold. A time line of key  actions associated with the unit\u2019s mobilization under Operation Enduring  Freedom is shown in figure 8. As summarized in table 24, all 24 of the deployed soldiers experienced at  least one pay problem associated with their activation to, during, and  deactivation from, active duty service in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom. Specifically, we found that (1) 5 soldiers experienced  underpayments or late payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 24  soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late payments  during their tour of active duty in and around Kuwait, including in-theater  incentives such as hostile fire pay and hardship duty pay; and (3) 1 soldier  was underpaid entitled pays and allowances associated with his  demobilization. In total, we identified estimated overpayments of about $3,000,  underpayments of about $2,000, and late payments of about $14,000,  associated with the pay problems we identified. Specifically, we  determined the following:   More than half of the $3,000 in overpayments we identified was  associated with the majority of the unit\u2019s soldiers receiving an extra $75  payment of hostile fire pay during their tour of active duty in Kuwait. More than 70 percent of the soldiers deployed to Kuwait did not receive  hardship duty pay in the months of May and December 2003,  contributing to the underpayments of $2,000. An estimated $8,000 of the $14,000 in late payments we identified were  associated with two soldiers. Available pay records for one soldier show  he did not receive the correct amount of basic allowance for housing  during his active duty tour until 9 months after his mobilization date.  Another soldier did not receive the correct amount of basic pay and  basic allowance for housing until approximately 3 months after his  promotion had become effective. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 25, we identified several soldiers who experienced  underpayments or late payments related to basic pay and associated  entitlements associated with the mobilization phase. Most, if not all, of  these cases were likely the result of proper documentation not being  submitted promptly, resulting in some soldiers receiving delayed housing  allowances and promotions. For example, one soldier did not receive the  correct amount of basic pay and basic allowance for housing based on a  promotion that should have been effective in January 2003 but did not get  processed until 3 months later in mid-April. We found the personnel action  form was not signed until April 2003. Upon receipt of individual mobilization orders, the unit\u2019s soldiers reported  to their unit\u2019s home station in Fort Eustis, Virginia, where they attended a  SRP. The purpose of this SRP was to ensure that all soldiers had all  required administrative paperwork, financial documents, and were  physically fit for the ensuing mobilization. Personnel from the 99th Regional  Readiness Command sent a team who conducted the finance portion of the  SRP to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial documentation. If  necessary, the 99th Regional Readiness Command team submitted  transactions with the necessary supporting documentation to the Reserve  Pay Center at Fort McCoy to update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay  Accounts to correctly reflect their mobilized pay status. However, we  identified several soldiers who did not have appropriate supporting  documentation maintained in their files to justify basic allowance for  housing payments. For example, we identified 12 soldiers who received  basic allowance for housing payments for which we were unable to obtain  supporting documentation (i.e., DA Form 5960). Total basic allowance for  housing payments for those 12 soldiers amounted to over $110,000. Additionally, we identified inconsistencies with the determinations of  soldiers\u2019 entitlements to the family separation allowance made at the  mobilization station. According to the DOD FMR Volume 7A, soldiers  should be separated from their families by more than 50 miles in order to  receive the family separation allowance. We found 10 soldiers from the  629th Transportation Detachment, including the soldier who was placed on  medical hold, who received the family separation allowance while at their  home station and mobilization station even though that location was less  than 50 miles from their home. The soldiers were never informed by pay  technicians at the unit or at their mobilization station that they were not  entitled to the family separation allowance if they were staying at Fort  Eustis but their home of record was within 50 miles, and we did not see any  documentation showing that the unit commander had approved an  exception to the mileage restriction on family separation allowance  eligibility. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 26, we identified a number of pay problems with  five different types of active duty pays and allowances associated with the  unit\u2019s deployment while on active duty. During the soldiers\u2019 deployment to Kuwait, all 24 of the 629th  Transportation Detachment\u2019s soldiers encountered pay problems related to  hardship duty pay and hostile fire pay. Most soldiers did not receive any  hardship duty pay during the month they arrived in-theater and the month  that they left the theater. In addition, all of the soldiers received their  combat zone tax exclusion benefit at least one month late. Per DOD FMR Volume 7A, soldiers who perform duties in designated areas  for over 30 days are entitled to the hardship duty pay incentive. The  regulation specified the general area of Kuwait as a designated area and  provided $100 a month to all soldiers serving there. Per the same  regulation, soldiers serving in Kuwait are also entitled to hostile fire pay of  $225 per month. Both hardship duty pay and hostile fire pay should start at  the same time upon the soldier\u2019s arrival in Kuwait. In the case of the 629th  Transportation Detachment, the soldiers had their military identification  cards swiped into the Tactical Personnel System upon landing in Kuwait to  document their date of arrival. However, most of the soldiers never  received any payment for hardship duty pay in the month that they arrived  in Kuwait, nor did most receive any hardship duty pay payment in the  month that they left Kuwait. Officials at the local Army area servicing  finance office did not initiate the unit\u2019s hostile fire pay incentive until 1  month after the soldiers arrived in theater. Furthermore, the soldiers  incorrectly received a hostile fire pay payment of $300 during the month of  June (an overpayment of $75). One of the unit\u2019s soldiers left Kuwait earlier  than the rest of the unit, but the soldier\u2019s hardship duty pay continued for  another 6 months and his hostile fire pay continued for 1 extra month  before it was stopped. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Soldiers of the 629th Transportation Detachment returned to their  demobilization station at Fort Eustis, Virginia, around December 5, 2003,  and began the SRP out-processing. As summarized in table 27, we identified  one soldier who experienced pay problems associated with the  demobilization phase of his active duty tour. We identified one soldier who did not receive any family separation  allowance payments during the last 3 months of active duty. This soldier\u2019s  home of record was more than 50 miles from the demobilization station in  Fort Eustis, Virginia, and he was not commuting daily. Consequently, he  should have received family separation allowance for these 3 months. Ten  other soldiers in the unit who returned to Fort Eustis and lived within the  50-mile range of the demobilization station and did not have a commander\u2019s  exception on file received $250 per month in family separation allowance  payments until their release from active duty. By January 2004, all  mobilized soldiers, with the exception of the soldier who was on medical  hold, were released from active duty. 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment New  Haven, Connecticut The 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment was called to active duty in  support of Operation Noble Eagle on December 3, 2002. A total of 11  soldiers from the unit were mobilized to support operations at the  Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The 3423rd  Military Intelligence Detachment does not have a unit administrator during  peacetime and had no dedicated unit administrator during the mobilization.  The unit was called to active duty and reported to its mobilization station,  Fort Lee, Virginia, where the soldiers went through in-processing during  December 2002. After this processing, the unit went to the Army\u2019s National  Ground Intelligence Center in Charlottesville, Virginia, for 1 week of  additional in-processing and was then transferred to Fort Belvoir. For the  next 11 months, the unit carried out its mission to gather and analyze  intelligence information in support of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security  Command operations at Fort Belvoir. In November 2003, the 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment began to demobilize at Fort Lee and by December  2, 2003, all but 1 soldier had been released from active duty. The unit  reported that the remaining soldier stayed on active duty at Fort Belvoir for  an additional year. A time line of key actions associated with the unit\u2019s  mobilization to active duty is shown in figure 9. As summarized in table 28, soldiers experienced a range of pay problems at  every stage of the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment\u2019s tour of active  duty. The unit did not have a dedicated unit administrator to carry out pay  support responsibilities during its active duty mobilization. Overall, all 11  soldiers in the unit experienced some type of pay problem associated with  their activation to, during, or deactivation from active duty in support of  Operation Noble Eagle. Specifically, we found that (1) 10 soldiers  experienced underpayments, overpayments or late payments during their  initial mobilization; (2) 9 soldiers experienced underpayments,  overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active duty at Fort  Belvoir; and (3) 9 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments during their demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with the overpayments, underpayments,  and late payments we identified were about $18,500, $4,000, and $5,000,  respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $2,000 were  subsequently collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers as of January 31, 2004. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 29, we found that 10 of the 11 soldiers from the  3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment experienced pay problems related  to basic pay and the associated entitlements when called to active duty. Before mobilization, the unit attended several SRPs put on by the 94th  Regional Readiness Command. Specifically, after September 11, 2001, the  unit received warnings that it might be called up and therefore began  attending SRPs to prepare for impending mobilization. The unit first  attended a program at the Reserve center in Waterbury, Connecticut, in  October 2001, along with several other units that were definitely  mobilizing. The soldiers attended a second SRP in November 2002. The  finance portion of the SRP consisted of a briefing that covered the different  entitlements soldiers could expect to receive and a review of the soldiers\u2019  Master Military Pay Accounts. Upon reporting to the active Army  mobilization station at Fort Lee, the unit underwent a third SRP. We found 10 of the 11 soldiers in the 3423rd Military Intelligence  Detachment were entitled to the continental U.S. cost of living allowance  during their mobilization at a rate based on their principal place of  residence at the time they were ordered to active duty. One of these 10  soldiers did not receive the entitlement during his mobilization, resulting in  a $500 underpayment. The 9 remaining soldiers erroneously began  receiving the overseas cost of living allowance rather than the continental  U.S. cost of living allowance at the beginning of the mobilization. In April  2003, all 9 soldiers began correctly receiving continental U.S. cost of living  allowance and the entitlement was paid retroactively in May to 8 of the soldiers for the period December 2002 through March 2003. The erroneous  payments of the overseas cost of living allowance were collected  immediately for 4 of the soldiers, while the erroneous payments for the  other 4 soldiers were only partially collected later in the mobilization. The  delay in collecting the overseas cost of living allowance for the 4 soldiers  resulted in overpayments of over $3,500 that were not collected in full by  the end of the mobilization. One soldier continued to receive the overseas  cost of living allowance and the continental U.S. cost of living allowance  concurrently through August 2003, totaling more than $2,500. DOD began  to recoup these amounts in October 2003. In addition to the overpayments  and underpayments associated with overseas cost of living allowance  payments, discrepancies between the overseas and continental U.S. cost of  living allowance rates for 8 of the 9 soldiers led to over $700 in late  payments. We also found that 9 of the 10 soldiers in the 3423rd Military Intelligence  Detachment received family separation allowance overpayments during  mobilization. Because of pay clerks\u2019 confusion regarding family separation  allowance entitlement rules, the 9 soldiers began receiving the family  separation allowance 1 to 3 days earlier than they should have, resulting in  small overpayments that totaled almost $200 for the unit. Additionally, one soldier in the unit experienced a problem related to his  basic allowance for housing pay during mobilization. Shortly after  mobilization, the soldier\u2019s basic allowance for housing entitlement  erroneously switched from the \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate to the \u201cwithout  dependents\u201d rate for half of December 2002 and for January through March  2003. In April 2003, the soldier was repaid basic allowance for housing at  the \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate for January through March 2003. These  switches resulted in $800 in payments more than 30 days after the soldier  was entitled and almost $200 in underpayments for the period in December  2002 when the soldier did not receive basic allowance for housing at the  \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate. Furthermore, even though the soldier was  deployed from his home in Connecticut to his active duty location at Fort  Belvior in Virginia, he did not received his family separation allowance for  the entire mobilization, creating an estimated $3,000 underpayment. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 30, we identified a number of pay problems  associated with active duty pays and allowances during the 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment\u2019s deployment while on active duty. Two soldiers experienced individual problems with active duty basic pay,  basic allowance for housing, and foreign language proficiency pay.  Additionally, during their deployment to Fort Belvoir, the unit\u2019s soldiers  experienced pay problems related to the basic allowance for subsistence  provided to enlisted soldiers. Ten of the 11 soldiers in the unit experienced  some sort of overpayment, underpayment, or late payment associated with  their deployment. Two soldiers experienced problems relating to various pay entitlements  during their deployment. One soldier received about $1,800 in active duty  basic pay and basic allowance for housing payments more than 30 days  after he was entitled to receive them because of a delay in processing his  promotion. Another soldier did not receive his foreign language proficiency  pay for 1 month of his deployment, creating a $100 underpayment. While we did not count any of the unit\u2019s basic allowance for subsistence  payments as pay problems because of incomplete documentation, seven  enlisted soldiers in the unit experienced significant confusion over whether  they received their correct basic allowance for subsistence payments. The  unit\u2019s enlisted soldiers initially received the regular basic allowance for  subsistence until April 2003. At that time, all basic allowance for  subsistence amounts paid to these soldiers were collected and a different  basic allowance for subsistence rate, called \u201crations in kind not available,\u201d  was retroactively paid to these soldiers. In 2003, rations-in-kind-not- available payments were about $20 more per month than the regular basic  allowance for subsistence. However, finance personnel at the Intelligence and Security Command (the  unit\u2019s servicing finance office while deployed at Fort Belvoir) determined  that even though the unit was issued orders stating that housing and mess  would not be provided, the soldiers actually could eat at the Fort Belvoir  mess. This resulted in (1) a collection in May of all of the previous rations- in-kind-not available payments to the unit\u2019s soldiers except for payments  for the initial mobilization time prior to arrival at Fort Belvoir, and (2) a  retroactive repayment of the regular basic allowance for subsistence.  Nevertheless, the enlisted soldiers continued to receive the rations-in-kind- not-available rate from mid-May through July 2003. In July 2003, Fort  McCoy again initiated transactions to collect the rations-in-kind-not- available payments and instead pay regular basic allowance for  subsistence. The regular basic allowance for subsistence then continued  for the rest of the unit\u2019s mobilization, despite the fact that in June 2003, a  committee of finance personnel at Fort Belvoir determined that it was not  feasible for the soldiers to continue to use the mess facilities at Fort Belvoir  because of mission requirements and transportation costs. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty The soldiers of the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment began to  demobilize in November 2003. As summarized in table 31, some soldiers  continued to experience pay problems throughout their demobilization and  release from active duty. Of the 10 soldiers who demobilized by the end of our audit period, 9  continued to receive their active duty pay and entitlements past the date of  separation from the Army. Two of the 9 overpaid soldiers continued to  receive their entitlements for 28 days past the date of demobilization, while  the remaining 7 soldiers were overpaid for 13 days. This resulted in $14,000  in overpayments of active duty basic pay, basic allowance for housing,  basic allowance for subsistence, and where applicable, the family  separation allowance and foreign language proficiency pay. When demobilizing through Fort Lee, the demobilization finance officials  failed to change the pay status code in DJMS-RC to stop active duty pay for  nine of the unit\u2019s soldiers. The timing of the unit\u2019s release from active duty  made it more difficult to catch and correct these concerns, as the soldiers  demobilized during the Thanksgiving holiday and a particularly severe  snowstorm. The problem was eventually caught and corrected by the 94th  Regional Readiness Command when personnel examined the Unit  Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report in January 2004. Finance personnel  at the 94th Regional Readiness Command reported that available pay  reports indicated most of the soldiers\u2019 overpayments have now been  collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers. 431st Chemical Detachment Johnstown,  Pennsylvania The 431st Chemical Detachment was called to active duty in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom on January 16, 2003, for a period not to  exceed 365 days. Ten soldiers who received orders to mobilize with the  431st Chemical Detachment reported to their home station in Johnstown,  Pennsylvania, on January 16, 2003. They underwent an initial SRP at their  Johnstown home station. On January 19, 2003, they arrived at their  designated mobilization station at Fort Dix, New Jersey, where they  remained for the next month undergoing additional in-processing and  training. Approximately 1 month later, around February 22, 2003, 8 of the 10  soldiers from the 431st Chemical Detachment were deployed to Kuwait.  Two soldiers from the unit left for Kuwait 1 month later, on March 20, 2003. The primary mission of the 431st Chemical Detachment while deployed in  and around Kuwait was to track and report nuclear, biological, or chemical  attacks so that soldiers in the area could take appropriate protective  actions. After completing their mission, all 10 soldiers in the detachment  left Kuwait on May 21, 2003. Upon returning to Fort Dix, the soldiers began  the demobilization process and stayed at Fort Dix until the end of June  2003. For the period of July 1 through July 15, 2003, all of the soldiers in the  431st Chemical Detachment were placed on transitional leave. By July 15,  2003, all of the soldiers had been released from active duty. A time line of  key actions associated with the unit\u2019s mobilization under Operation  Enduring Freedom is shown in figure 10. As summarized in table 32, all 10 of the unit\u2019s soldiers experienced some  sort of pay problem, primarily associated with the overseas deployment  phase of their active duty mobilization. Pay problems included  overpayments, underpayments, and late payments of pay entitlements and  incentives, such as family separation allowance, hostile fire pay, and  hardship duty pay associated with their initial mobilization and deployment  to Kuwait. In total, we identified estimated overpayments of about $12,000,  underpayments of about $2,000, and late payments of about $1,000  associated with the pay problems we identified. Of the estimated $12,000 in  identified overpayments, we identified about $450 that was subsequently  collected. Specifically, we determined that   2 soldiers did not receive correct payments for up to 6 months after their   all 10 soldiers in the unit experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments associated with their tour of active duty deployment in  Kuwait, including problems with hostile fire pay and hardship duty pay. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 33, we identified six soldiers with pay problems  related to overpayments of family separation allowance during the unit\u2019s  initial mobilization to active duty. Upon receipt of individual mobilization orders, the soldiers reported to  their unit\u2019s home station in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where they attended  a SRP. The purpose of this SRP was to ensure that all soldiers had all  required administrative paperwork, financial documents, and were  physically fit for the ensuing mobilization. SRP finance officials were  required to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial documentation and  submit transactions with the necessary supporting documentation to the  Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy to update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military  Pay Accounts to reflect their mobilized status. However, we identified several soldiers who did not have appropriate  supporting documentation maintained in their files to justify their basic  allowance for housing payments. One soldier appeared to be underpaid for  the basic allowance for housing during the period that he was called to  report to his home station for active duty. During the first pay period of his  mobilization, he was paid at a lower basic allowance for housing rate.  Subsequent payments for the basic allowance for housing throughout his  tour of duty were at a higher rate. We were not able to substantiate the  higher amount through supporting documentation. The total basic  allowance for housing payments to this soldier that could not be verified  amounted to approximately $3,500. Furthermore, we identified four other soldiers who received basic  allowance for housing payments for which we were unable to obtain  supporting documentation (i.e., DA Form 5960). Total basic allowance for  housing payments for those four soldiers amounted to approximately  $30,000. In addition, we identified six soldiers in the 431st Chemical Detachment  who received overpayments of the family separation allowance because  they began receiving this entitlement upon reporting to their home station,  even though that location was less than 50 miles from their homes and  there was no evidence that they had an unreasonable commuting distance,  as required by DOD FMR Volume 7A. Based on these criteria, the family  separation allowance payments should not have started until the soldiers  reached their mobilization station at Fort Dix, New Jersey. The family  separation allowance overpayments to these soldiers totaled $150. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 34, we found that during the soldiers\u2019 deployment  to Kuwait, they experienced problems related to hardship duty pay and  hostile fire pay. In addition, all of the soldiers received their combat zone  tax exclusion benefit at least 1 month late. Most soldiers did not receive the full amount of their hardship duty pay  while deployed. Moreover, they continued to receive hardship duty pay  well after they had returned to Fort Dix and demobilized. In total, all 10  deployed soldiers were incorrectly paid for either hardship duty or hostile  fire pay. Soldiers of the 431st Chemical Detachment who deployed overseas had  their identification cards scanned into the Tactical Personnel System upon  landing at Kuwait International Airport. However, the unit\u2019s hostile fire  payments did not start until more than 2 months after the soldiers arrived  in theater. Moreover, it took approximately 3 months from the time that the  soldiers arrived to start receiving hardship duty payments. In fact, hardship  duty payments were not processed until May 21, 2003, the same day that  the soldiers left the designated hardship duty location. These delays resulted in the deployed soldiers being underpaid for most of  their time while serving in the hardship duty location. Furthermore,  hardship duty pay continued for another 7 months after the soldiers had  left Kuwait. As a result, the soldiers continued to receive payments of  hardship duty pay after their demobilization and release from active duty.  Also, local Army area servicing finance officials did not terminate  payments of hostile fire pay for the 2 months following the soldiers\u2019 return  to the United States. These two breakdowns in the process of paying the  correct in-theater incentives to soldiers in a timely manner resulted in  underpayments or late payments at the front end of the soldiers\u2019  deployment and overpayments after the soldiers had returned. In addition, the unit administrator, who also deployed with the unit, stated  that she had trouble finding anyone in the local Army area servicing finance  office in Kuwait to assist with getting the unit\u2019s hostile fire pay started.  Since the 431st Chemical Detachment was working for the Marine Corps  and was far away from the Army area servicing finance office, the unit was  given the number at Fort Doha as its supporting finance office in Kuwait.  The unit administrator made repeated telephone attempts to contact the  finance office at Fort Doha but could only reach a recording that told her to  call back later. This gap in a functioning supporting finance office for the  deployed soldiers added to their frustration and confusion over in-theater  pays. Upon the unit\u2019s return to the U.S. in May 2003, most of the soldiers noticed  that they continued to receive an additional $100 per month for 7 additional  months. However, because their Leave and Earnings Statements were not  clear as to what the payments represented, the soldiers contacted the unit  administrator for assistance. The unit administrator determined that the  payments represented erroneous hardship duty pay and tried to go through  the unit\u2019s chain of command to get the payments stopped, but received no  response. The unit administrator also accessed the pay hotline at 888-PAY- ARMY, but was placed on hold for such a long time that she gave up. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty All 10 soldiers of the 431st Chemical Detachment arrived at the  demobilization station at Fort Dix, New Jersey, on May 21, 2003, to begin  the SRP out-processing. The soldiers were stationed at Fort Dix for  approximately 1 month. At the end of June 2003, the soldiers returned to  their home station in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where they spent a few  days before being placed on transitional leave for the first 2 weeks in July  2003. While on transitional leave, the soldiers continued to receive $250 per  month for the family separation allowance even though they were not  separated from their families.

      "Background The Army Reserve is a partner with the active Army and the Army National  Guard in fulfilling the country's military and contingency needs. The Army  Reserve provides nearly half of the Army\u2019s combat support capabilities.  The Army Reserve has approximately 2,000 units that drill at 1,500 Army  Reserve Centers located in communities spread throughout the United  States and territories. As of May 2004, the Army Reserve reported that it  had about 328,000 members in the Ready Reserve. During peacetime, Army Reserve units report to the United States Army  Reserve Command (USARC), located in Atlanta, Georgia,",
      " and the Chief of  the Army Reserve, located in Washington, D.C. In addition, the Army  Reserve has established Regional Readiness Commands to provide  resource, logistics, and personnel management support for Army Reserve  units within their region. When not mobilized to active duty, Army Reserve  units are required to maintain readiness at a sufficiently high level to  facilitate prompt active duty mobilization. While in a reserve status, Army  Reserve soldiers are required to attend one drill weekend each month and  obtain a minimum amount of training (usually about 2 weeks) each year.  During national emergencies, the President has the authority to mobilize  the Army Reserve to active duty status.",
      " While mobilized, Army Reserve  units are accountable to the combatant commander of the theater in which  they are assigned to operate, and ultimately, to the President. On September 14, 2001, the President declared a national emergency as a  result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United  States. Concurrent with this declaration, the President authorized the  Secretary of Defense to mobilize reserve troops to active duty pursuant to  10 U.S.C. Section 12302. The Secretary of Defense delegated to the  Secretary of the Army the authority to order Army Reserve soldiers to  active duty.",
      " Since September 2001, the Army has mobilized unprecedented  numbers of Army Reserve soldiers (as well as other reserve and national  guard forces) to active duty on lengthy tours. DOD reported that as of April  2004, about 96,000 Army Reserve soldiers have been mobilized to active  duty at some point since September 2001 to carry out critical missions. In contrast to the Army National Guard forces that may be assigned  traditional combat roles, Army Reserve forces are generally assigned  combat support missions. The Army National Guard and Army Reserve  both include military police and intelligence units. However, while the  Army National Guard has special forces and other units that have combat  mission assignments,",
      " Army Reserve units are generally limited to combat  support mission assignments, such as supply, medical, and transportation  operations. Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 mobilizations during the period of our audit were  also affected by two other Army actions. First, the Army issued a \u201cstop  loss\u201d order affecting Army Reserve soldiers in November 2002. The stop  loss order was authorized by statute and allows the Army to retain soldiers  in the service beyond their date of separation or retirement for an open- ended period. Second, in November 2003, the Army extended the orders  for all mobilized Army Reserve soldiers expected to return from active duty  on December 1,",
      " 2003, for an additional year. There have been three major contingency operations involving mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers since September 2001: Operation Noble Eagle,  Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In general,  missions to provide domestic defense were funded through Operation  Noble Eagle, missions to fight terrorism outside the United States were  initially funded under Operation Enduring Freedom. More recently,  missions related to the combat in Iraq and subsequent policing operations  in that region were funded under Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example,  Army Reserve soldiers participated in combat support missions in  Afghanistan that were carried out as part of Operation Enduring Freedom,",
      "  whereas Army Reserve soldiers participating in homeland security  missions, such as assisting in intelligence data analysis, were considered  part of Operation Noble Eagle. According to Army Reserve data, approximately 45,700 Army Reserve  soldiers were activated as of April 2004. At that time, Army Reserve  soldiers accounted for about 27 percent of all mobilized DOD reserve  components. Many of these Army Reserve soldiers were mobilized as  small units, including about 2,800 units with 10 or fewer soldiers and about  1,000 one-soldier units. The Army assigns a separate unit identification  number to each of these small groups or detachments of Army Reserve  soldiers (these units are known as derivative units). According to Army  Reserve data as of April 2004,",
      " the Army Reserve had soldiers assigned to  almost 6,000 different unit numbers. While on active duty, all Army Reserve soldiers earn various statutorily  authorized types of pays and allowances. The types and amounts of pays  and allowances that Army Reserve soldiers are eligible to receive vary  depending upon rank and length of service, dependency status, skills and  certifications acquired, duty location, and the difficulty of the assignment.  While Army Reserve soldiers mobilized to active duty may be entitled to  receive over 50 types of pays and allowances, we focused on 14 types of  pays and allowances applicable to the Army Reserve units we selected for  case studies.",
      " As shown in table 1, we categorized these 14 pay and  allowance types into two groups: (1) pays, including basic pay, medical and  dental and foreign language proficiency skill-based pays, and location- based hostile fire and hardship duty pays, and (2) allowances, including allowances for housing, subsistence, family separation, and cost of living  for the continental United States. Several of these types of pays and allowances have multiple subcategories  of entitlement. For example, there are eight different types of basic  allowances for housing that soldiers may be entitled to receive based on  individual circumstances and documentation (including documents  establishing dependency status or court documents). In addition,",
      " Army  Reserve soldiers may be eligible for significant tax advantages associated  with their mobilization to active duty. Mobilized Army Reserve soldiers  assigned to or working in a designated combat zone are entitled to exclude  from taxable income certain types of military pays that would otherwise be  taxable. In addition to the complexities of determining and documenting the  specific circumstances surrounding each individual soldier\u2019s initial active  duty pay, allowance, and tax benefit entitlements, these types of pays and  benefits are further complicated because entitlements vary depending on  soldiers\u2019 locations as they move through their active duty tours. That is,  maintaining effective accountability and paying mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers as they move from location to location during their active duty  tours require extensive close coordination among a variety of operational,",
      "  personnel, finance, and pay organizations throughout DOD. Key  components requiring closely coordinated efforts in this worldwide team  are the  mobilized soldier;  unit commanders and unit administrators for all mobilized Army   United States Army Reserve Pay Center located at Fort McCoy;  Army Reserve Pay Management Division at Fort McPherson;  12 Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands;  U.S. Army Finance Command;  personnel and finance offices at Army mobilization stations;  Army area servicing finance offices assigned to support deployed units;   personnel and finance offices at Army demobilization stations;  Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)",
      " at Indianapolis,   DFAS at Denver, Colorado; and  DFAS at Cleveland, Ohio. As shown in figure 1, three key phases are associated with the pays and  allowances applicable to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers:   (1) mobilization: starting applicable active duty pays and allowances,   (2) deployment: starting and stopping applicable location-based active duty  pays while continuing other nonlocation-based active duty pay and  allowance entitlements, and (3) demobilization: stopping active duty pays  and allowances. Mobilization Phase During the initial mobilization, units receive an alert order and begin a  mobilization preparation program,",
      " Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP).  Among other things, the SRP is intended to ensure that each soldier\u2019s  financial records are in order. The initial SRP is to be conducted by the  unit\u2019s administrator at the unit\u2019s home station assisted by personnel from  the cognizant Army Reserve Regional Readiness Command or designee.  This initial SRP is to include a verification of the accuracy of records  supporting applicable active duty pays and allowances. The unit  commander, supported by the unit administrator, is responsible for  ensuring that all personnel data, such as birth certificates for dependents  or foreign language certifications, are current for all soldiers under their  command.",
      " During this phase, the unit administrator is required to gather all  supporting documents and send the documentation to the Reserve Pay  Center at Fort McCoy. Pay technicians at the Reserve Pay Center are  responsible for entering transactions to start initiating basic pay and  allowances for mobilized Army Reserve soldiers based on the active duty  tour information that appears on a hard copy of each soldier\u2019s mobilization  order. If transactions are entered correctly and on time, activated Army  Reserve soldiers will automatically start to receive basic pay and basic  allowances for housing and subsistence based on the entered active duty  mobilization start date. After soldiers complete their initial SRP,",
      " they travel as a unit to an assigned  active duty Army mobilization station. At the mobilization station,  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are required to undergo a second SRP. As  part of this second SRP, finance personnel at the mobilization station are  responsible for confirming or correcting the results of the first SRP,  including obtaining the documentation necessary to support any changes  needed to the automated pay records. Pay technicians at the various Army  mobilization stations are required to promptly initiate appropriate active  duty pay and allowance transactions that were not initiated during the first  SRP. Transactions to initiate and terminate pays for all mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers entitled to receive special medical and dental pay  entitlements are entered and processed centrally at DFAS-",
      "Indianapolis. Deployment Phase While Army Reserve soldiers are deployed on active duty, there are several  active Army and DFAS components involved in paying them. The Army  area servicing finance office, which may be within the United States or in a  foreign country, is responsible for initiating pays earned while the soldier is  located in certain specified locations, such as location-based pays for  hostile fire and hardship duty. Pay technicians at these area servicing  finance offices are responsible for starting these types of pays for each  soldier based on documentation, such as annotated battle rosters or flight  manifests, showing when soldiers arrived at these designated locations.  Thereafter,",
      " hostile fire pay is automatically generated each pay period until  an established end-of-tour date is reached or a pay technician manually  stops the pay. In contrast, other location-based pays, such as hardship duty  pay, require manual entry of pay transactions each month by the assigned  Army area servicing finance office. While the designated Army area servicing finance offices have primary  responsibility for administering pay for deployed Army Reserve soldiers,  particularly starting and stopping location-based active duty pays (such as  hardship duty pay), finance personnel at the cognizant mobilization station  or at the Reserve Pay Center can also enter certain pay-altering  transactions that occur during deployments,",
      " such as those related to a  soldier\u2019s early separation from active duty. In addition, the Reserve Pay  Center has responsibility for entering all monthly nonlocation-based,  nonautomated pay and allowance transactions, such as foreign language  proficiency pay. Demobilization Phase Upon completion of an active duty tour, Army Reserve soldiers normally  return to the same active Army locations from which they were mobilized  for demobilization processing before returning to their home stations. The  personnel section at the demobilization station is required to provide each  soldier and the military pay technicians at the demobilization station with a  copy of the Release from Active Duty order and a DD Form 214,",
      " Certificate  of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. The demobilization station  military pay technicians are required to use the date of release from active  duty shown on these documents as a basis for stopping all Army Reserve  soldiers\u2019 active duty pay and allowances. The Reserve Pay Center is  responsible for discontinuing monthly input of all nonlocation-based,  nonautomated pays and allowances. If the active Army demobilization  station did not take action to stop active duty payments for demobilized  Army Reserve soldiers, or if a soldier did not return to the demobilization  station for active duty out-processing, the responsibility for stopping active  duty pays and allowances falls to the soldier\u2019s unit or the Reserve Pay  Center.",
      " Automated Systems  Environment Paying Army Reserve soldiers is complicated by the number of  nonintegrated, automated order-writing, tactical, personnel, and pay  systems involved in authorizing, entering, and processing active duty pays  and allowances to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers during the  mobilization, deployment, and demobilization phases of their active duty  tours. These automated systems are  the Defense Joint Military Pay System \u2013 Reserve Component (DJMS- RC)\u2014a DFAS-operated system used to pay reserve soldiers;  the Defense Military Pay Office (DMO)\u2014data input system used to enter  pay transactions for processing;   the Army Reserve\u2019s Regional Level Application System (RLAS),  including its personnel order-writing functions;",
      "  the Total Army Personnel Database\u2013Reserves (TAPDB-R);  the Army\u2019s Tactical Personnel System; and   the Army\u2019s Transition Processing (TRANSPROC) System. Many of these systems were originally designed for other purposes, but  have been adapted to help support payments to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. For example, DJMS-RC, a large, complex automated payroll  system application now used to pay Army and Air National Guard and  Army and Air Force Reserve soldiers, was originally designed to be used to  pay Reserve and Guard soldiers for monthly drills, short periods (30 days  or fewer) of active duty or training.",
      " DFAS has acknowledged that its  current military pay systems (including DJMS-RC) are aging, unresponsive,  fragile, and a major impediment to efficient and high-quality customer  service. DFAS has primary responsibility for developing guidance and managing  system operations for DJMS-RC. DFAS-Denver is responsible for designing,  developing, and maintaining customer requirements for all of DOD\u2019s  military pay services. Its Technical Support Office is responsible for  designing and maintaining the DJMS-RC core pay software. DFAS- Indianapolis is the central site for oversight of all Army military pay. As  such, DFAS-",
      "Indianapolis is responsible for maintaining an estimated   1 million Army soldier pay records, including those for Army Reserve  soldiers. DFAS-Indianapolis serves as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for DJMS-RC in that it  monitors the daily status of data uploaded to the system to ensure that all  received transactions are processed. After manual entry of the mobilization dates from hard copies of  mobilization orders into DJMS-RC, DJMS-RC is designed to automatically  generate most active duty pay and allowance payments based on the  mobilization date, twice a month, until the stop date is entered into the  system. Without additional manual intervention,",
      " DJMS-RC will  automatically stop generating these active duty payments to Army Reserve  soldiers as of the stop date recorded in DJMS-RC. This automated edit  control feature is intended to prevent erroneous payments to soldiers  beyond their authorized end of active duty date. Because pay and  personnel systems are not integrated, human intervention and additional  manual data entry are required when a pay or allowance error is detected  or an event occurs that requires a change in the soldier\u2019s pay-related  personnel and pay records. For example, a change in dependent status,  such as marriage or divorce; a promotion; jump pay disqualification; or  being demobilized before the active duty tour end date shown on a soldier\u2019s  original mobilization order would necessitate manual input to  appropriately change or eliminate some of the pays and allowances a  soldier would be entitled to receive.",
      " All Army Reserve soldier pays and allowances are to be documented in the  Master Military Pay Account\u2014the central repository for soldier pay  records in DJMS-RC. All pay-related transactions that are entered into  DJMS-RC, primarily through the DMO input application, update the Master  Military Pay Account. DMO is the DJMS-RC pay input subsystem used by  the Reserve Pay Center, active Army finance offices, and military pay  offices\u2014including offices located at overseas locations throughout the  world\u2014to enter transactions to initiate and stop active duty pays to  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. DMO is used to manually enter  transactions to (1)",

In addition to DJMS-RC and DMO, the Army Reserve relies on four other  nonintegrated automated systems as a basis for authorizing active duty pay,  allowance, and related benefit entitlements to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers:  RLAS is operated at the Army Reserve\u2019s regional support locations and  contains multiple modules to support regional human resource,",
      "  resource management, and training operations for Army Reserve  soldiers. The personnel module within RLAS is used to process Army  Reserve personnel actions, including those that have an impact on pay,  such as promotions and discharges. Within the personnel module, there  is an order-writing sub-module used for writing and generating  mobilization orders for individual Army Reserve soldiers. Army Reserve  soldier data in the personnel module of RLAS is used by the RLAS order- writing sub-module to help create the individual orders for mobilized  soldiers. TAPDB-R is the central repository for Army Reserve-wide personnel  data. Selected pay-related personnel data,",
      " such as solders\u2019 initial  enrollment in the Army Reserve, contained in Army Reserve soldiers\u2019  pay records in DJMS-RC, are received through an automated interface  with TAPDB-R. The Tactical Personnel System is a stand-alone Army-wide personnel  system operated by Army personnel at overseas airports where Army  soldiers first enter or leave an overseas deployment location. Hard  copies of Tactical Personnel System-generated manifests showing  names and dates of soldiers\u2019 arrivals and departures are one source of  authorization for starting or stopping Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 location- based hostile fire pay, hardship duty pay, and combat zone tax exclusion  tax benefits.",
      " Arriving and departing soldiers can enter data, such as  name, rank, and Social Security number, into the Tactical Personnel  System from their common access cards using a barcode scanner  function. TRANSPROC is an Army-wide system used to track and support Army  soldier processing at mobilization and demobilization stations.  TRANSPROC is used to generate a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release  or Discharge from Active Duty, for Army Reserve soldiers completing  their active duty mobilization tours. Case Studies Illustrate  Pay Problems We identified significant pay problems at all eight of the Army Reserve case  study units we audited.",
      " Specifically, we identified 256 Army Reserve  soldiers who were overpaid their active duty pay and allowance  entitlements by about $247,000, 245 soldiers who received late pay and  allowance payments of about $77,000, and 294 soldiers who were  underpaid their pay and allowance entitlements by about $51,000. As  discussed in the following sections, we found that these pay problems were  associated with a series of processes, human capital issues, and automated  system deficiencies. The Army Reserve units we audited for our case studies had various  functions, including a Quartermaster (supply), dental services,",
      "  transportation, military police, and military intelligence unit. These units  were assigned a variety of combat support missions associated with the  global war on terrorism while mobilized on active duty in and around Iraq,  Afghanistan, Qatar, and Kuwait and in support of intelligence operations  here in the United States. The units we audited, their locations, and  information about their mobilizations are shown in table 2. Overall, 332 of the 348 soldiers (95 percent) in our eight case study units  that were mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the 18- month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at least one pay  problem associated with their mobilization to active duty.",
      " Many of the  soldiers had multiple pay problems associated with their active duty  mobilizations. Problems lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of  time. For example, for some soldiers, problems lingered through the entire  period of their active duty mobilization and for several months after their  active duty tours ended. Table 3 summarizes the number of Army Reserve  soldiers at each of our case study locations that had at least one problem  associated with their pays and allowances during each of the three phases  of their active duty mobilization. We counted soldiers\u2019 pay problems as a problem only in the phase in which  the problem first occurred, even if the problems persisted into subsequent  phases.",
      " In addition, many soldiers had more than one problem associated  with their entitled pays and allowances. Further, our case study audits  reflect only the problems we identified. However, because our audits were  only intended to provide more detailed perspective on the types and causes  of any pay problems experienced by mobilized Army Reserve soldiers,  rather than an exact calculation of what soldiers should have received, we  likely did not identify all of the active duty pay and allowance problems  related to our case study units. In addition to pay and allowance problems, while we did not attempt to  fully quantify the tax withholding and tax filing effects, we also identified  problems with timeliness and accuracy of combat zone tax exclusion  benefits for soldiers with the seven case study units we audited that were  deployed overseas in Kuwait,",
      " Afghanistan, Qatar, or Iraq. Specifically, while  soldiers in these units were eligible to receive their pays and allowances  tax free when they first arrived in-theater, almost all failed to receive this  benefit until at least a month after arrival. Over- and underpayment of  active duty pays and allowances for soldiers deployed in designated  combat zones adversely impacted the accuracy and timeliness of soldiers\u2019  combat zone tax exclusion benefits. Establishing the exact amount owed and collecting overpayments of active  duty pays and allowances erroneously provided to soldiers placed an  additional administrative burden on both the individual soldiers and DOD.  Soldiers were sometimes required to spend considerable time and were  frustrated in their efforts to determine the exact sums owed or to establish  a repayment plan.",
      " For example, it took one soldier over a year and about 20  phone calls, e-mails, and faxes to identify and resolve the active duty  overpayments and related tax benefits he received. In other instances, we  identified soldiers who received extensive improper active duty payments,  sometimes for over a year, but who may not have contacted anyone within  DOD to stop these erroneous overpayments. These soldiers received  significant overpayments, but did not acknowledge their receipt or set  aside sufficient funds to repay these erroneous overpayments. In these  instances, the soldiers may be subject to criminal prosecution. For  example, we identified a soldier who did not mobilize with his unit,",
      " yet  received over $36,000 in active duty pay and allowances for over a year.  When questioned, the soldier stated he was not aware that he had received  $36,000 in erroneous pay and could not immediately pay back all the  erroneous active duty overpayments he received. We referred this, and  other similar cases, to the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division for  further investigation into whether criminal prosecution of these soldiers  may be warranted for attempting to fraudulently convert government funds  to personal use. Further, these overpayment debts placed an additional labor-intensive  burden on the Army and DFAS. Determining the exact amounts soldiers  owed as a result of overpayments,",
      " particularly when the combat zone tax  exclusion benefits were involved, required labor-intensive efforts to gather  necessary supporting documentation (in some instances from multiple  locations) and compare these data with pay and tax withholdings,  sometimes spanning more than 1 year, to manually compute amounts owed  as a result of erroneous overpayments. In addition, DFAS was required to  track and monitor collections from soldiers against these debts. Collection  of these debts may become more difficult the longer they remain  outstanding. For example, Army auditors reported in 2003 that, to the  extent that soldiers leave the Army with outstanding debts, collection rates  are only about 40 percent.",
      " Examples of pay and allowance problems found through our audits of  soldiers\u2019 pay experiences at the eight case study units included the  following:  Forty-seven soldiers deployed overseas with the 824th Quartermaster  Company from North Carolina improperly received several months of  hardship duty pay, totaling about $30,000, for several months after they  left Kuwait. Nine soldiers of the 824th Quartermaster Company improperly received  family separation allowance payments totaling an estimated $6,250  while serving at Fort Bragg, their unit\u2019s home station. Forty-nine soldiers with the 824th Quartermaster Company did not  receive the hardship duty pay they were entitled to receive when they  arrived at their designated duty locations overseas until about 3 months  after their arrival.",
      " Subsequently, they continued to erroneously receive  hardship duty pay for 5 consecutive months after departure from their  overseas duty locations. Ten soldiers with the 443rd Military Police Company had problems with  their overseas housing allowance associated with their deployment in  Iraq, including five soldiers who were underpaid about $2,700 and seven  who did not receive their last allowance until more than 2 months after  their active duty tour ended. A soldier with the 443rd Military Police Company who demobilized from  an active duty deployment in August 2002, subsequently received  erroneous active duty payments of about $52,000 through May 2004.",
      "  These erroneous payments were not detected and stopped by DOD. The  soldier contacted us to ask for our assistance in resolving this matter. A soldier from the 965th Dental Company who received an emergency  evacuation from Kuwait as a result of an adverse reaction to anthrax  and antibiotic inoculations he received in preparing for his overseas  deployment, continued to receive about $2,900 in improper hostile fire  and hardship duty payments after his return from Kuwait. A soldier with the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment did not  receive an estimated $3,000 in family separation allowance payments  associated with his active duty mobilization.",
      " Further, seven of our eight units were deployed overseas during their  mobilization. Almost all the soldiers in these seven units had problems with  the timeliness of their combat zone tax exclusion benefits. All the soldiers  at our seven case study units who were deployed overseas experienced  problems with the late receipt of their combat zone tax benefits because  DJMS-RC could not simply stop withholding federal taxes, but instead had  to first withhold the taxes and then in the following month\u2019s pay  processing, reimburse the soldier the taxes previously withheld. As a  result, soldiers generally did not benefit from the tax exemption for at least  one month after their tax withholdings should have ceased.",
      " In addition to  this systemic issue, we identified other problems associated with these  benefits with respect to the soldiers at our case study units:  Twenty of the 20 soldiers with the 948th Forward Surgical Team waited  over 2 months after they arrived in Afghanistan to benefit from the  combat zone tax exclusion. It took nearly a year to identify and resolve a $1,100 overpayment  associated with one soldier\u2019s combat zone tax exclusion benefit. Several soldiers with Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company never  received the correct amount of reimbursement for taxes withheld,  which sometimes resulted in underwithholding taxes, and other times  resulted in overwithholding taxes.",
      " These pay mistakes were the source of many complaints, took  considerable time and effort to address, and were likely to have had an  adverse effect on soldier morale. In addition, soldiers at one of our case  study units told us that a delay in receiving their active duty pays and  allowances created financial hardship for them and their families.  Specifically, several of the unit\u2019s soldiers told us they could not pay their  bills when they were initially deployed overseas and were forced to borrow  money from friends and relatives in order to meet their financial  obligations. We provided data on the pay problems we identified to Army Reserve  officials. For the most part,",
      " they concurred with our analysis and reported  that they have taken action to address any identified over- and  underpayments and withholdings we identified. Appendixes II through IX  provide a more detailed description of the pay experiences of the soldiers  at each of the Army Reserve case study units we audited. Significant Weaknesses  Exist in Mobilized  Army Reserve Pay  Processes The pay problems we found were caused, at least in part, by design  weaknesses in the extensive, complex set of processes and procedures  relied on to provide active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits  to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. We identified issues with the  procedures in place for both determining eligibility and processing related  transactions of active duty pay to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers.",
      " These  process weaknesses involve not only the finance and military pay  component of the Army, Army Reserve, and DFAS, but the Army\u2019s  operational and personnel functions as well. Specifically, we found  deficiencies in processes for (1) tracking and maintaining accountability  over soldiers as they moved from location to location to carry out their  mobilization orders, (2) carrying out SRPs\u2014primarily at the mobilization  stations, (3) distributing and reconciling key pay and personnel reports  during mobilizations, and (4) determining eligibility for the family  separation allowance associated with active duty mobilizations. Flaws in Procedures for  Tracking and Maintaining  Accountability over Soldiers  throughout Mobilization Mobilization policies and procedures did not provide the Army with  effective accountability and visibility over soldiers\u2019 locations to provide  reasonable assurance of accurate and timely payments for Army Reserve  soldiers\u2019 active duty mobilizations.",
      " Accountability breakdowns can occur  as soldiers pass through four main transitions during the course of a typical  mobilization cycle, including transitions from (1) their home station to  their designated mobilization station, (2) the mobilization station to their  assigned deployment location, (3) the deployment location to their  demobilization station, and (4) the demobilization station back to their  home station. Soldiers\u2019 active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits are directly  tied to being able to account for soldiers\u2019 locations during these transitions.  For example, timely data on the dates soldiers arrive at and leave  designated locations are essential for accurate and timely hardship duty  pays,",
      " allowances, and related combat zone tax exclusion benefits. To  effectively account for soldiers\u2019 movements during these transitions, unit  commanders, unit administrators, as well as individuals assigned to  personnel and finance offices across the Army Reserves, Army  mobilization stations, and in-theater Army locations must work closely and  communicate extensively to have the necessary data to pay Army Reserve  soldiers accurately and on time throughout their active duty tours. However, we identified several critical flaws in the soldier accountability  procedures in place during the period of our audit. Specifically, we  identified flawed procedures for accountability over soldiers\u2019 actual  locations and associated pay entitlements in that (1)",
      " soldiers received  mobilization orders, but did not report for active duty and (2) dates of  soldiers\u2019 arrival at, and departure from, designated hardship duty  deployment locations were not reported. Such breakdowns in  accountability procedures resulted in erroneously starting, or delays in  starting, active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits, and  erroneously continuing these pays, allowances and benefits when soldiers  were no longer entitled to receive them. Mobilization Station  Accountability Effective procedures were not in place to monitor and validate the  propriety of active duty payments to mobilized reservists. We found that  preventive controls for initiating and stopping active duty payments for  Army Reserve soldiers were ineffective.",
      " In addition, the accountability  controls in place at Army stations responsible for unit mobilization and  demobilization processing were not effective in detecting any Army  Reserve soldiers assigned to units passing through those locations who  were not entitled to receive active duty pays and allowances. As a result of  these control design flaws, we found several soldiers who received up to a  year of active duty payments based on issued mobilization orders, even  though the soldiers never reported for active duty. Army officials have  acknowledged that active duty payments are increasingly vulnerable to  such overpayments as a result of the Army Reserve\u2019s November 2003 action  to extend Army Reserve soldiers on active duty at that time for another  year.",
      " When a unit is called to active duty, soldiers in the mobilized unit receive  individual mobilization orders. Processing procedures provide that these  orders be used as a basis for initiating active duty pays and allowances to  begin on the first day of active duty designated in the individual active duty  mobilization orders. The Reserve Pay Center, located at Fort McCoy, is  generally responsible for initiating active duty pays and allowances based  on the data shown on a hard copy of the individual orders. However, the  Reserve Pay Center did not receive the data necessary to identify, on a unit- by-unit basis, which soldiers reported to the active Army mobilization  stations so that this information could be compared with a list of soldiers  for that unit for whom the Reserve Pay Center started active duty pays and  allowances.",
      " In addition, Army mobilization station finance personnel did  not receive a list of soldiers in a unit who were receiving active duty pay to  compare with the names of unit soldiers who actually reported to the  mobilization station. At one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company, we found that this  process flaw resulted in tens of thousands of dollars in overpayments. Individual Case Illustration: Flawed Soldier Location  Accountability Procedures Result in $36,000 Erroneous Active  Duty Payments A soldier assigned to the 965th Dental Company received a mobilization  order, but based on a discussion with his commander about a medical  condition,",
      " was told he would be transferred to a unit that was not  mobilizing. However, the unit commander did not provide a list of the  unit\u2019s mobilizing soldiers to the Reserve Pay Center and did not provide  any information on this soldier indicating that he would not be reporting  to the unit\u2019s mobilization station. Consequently, neither the Reserve Pay  Center nor the mobilization station personnel had any means of detecting  that a soldier had not mobilized with his unit and therefore was  improperly receiving active duty payments. As a result, the soldier\u2019s pay  was started on February 11, 2003, and continued through February 29,",
      "  2004, resulting in more than $36,000 in overpayments. This improper  active duty pay was stopped only after we identified the error and  notified Army officials. In another instance, the Army\u2019s inability to determine that one soldier\u2019s  actual location did not match his \u201cpaper\u201d mobilization resulted in an  estimated $52,000 in erroneous payments. Individual Case Illustration:  Soldier Accountability Flaws Lead  to Estimated $52,000 in Erroneous Active Duty Payments   A soldier contacted GAO in March 2004 to inquire as to why he had been  receiving active duty pay for almost a year even though,",
      " according to the  soldier, he was not mobilized to active duty during that time.  Subsequent  inquiry determined that, at least on paper, the soldier was transferred  from Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company to Pennsylvania\u2019s 307th  Military Police Company in February 2003, and was mobilized to active  duty with that unit on March 3, 2003.  Applicable active duty pays and  allowances for the soldier were initiated based on these March 3, 2003,  orders.  After the 307th Military Police Company demobilized in February  2004, the soldier\u2019s mobilization order was revoked.",
      "  Nonetheless,  available pay documentation indicated the soldier continued receiving  erroneous active duty pay and allowances for basic pay, and allowances  for subsistence, housing, and family separation totaling an estimated  $52,000 through May of 2004. In addition, Army Reserve officials told us about similar cases at other  units not included in our case studies in which soldiers did not report for  active duty, but nonetheless received erroneous active duty pay for lengthy  periods. They told us they identified soldiers who received large improper  active duty payments, some of whom had received erroneous active duty  payments for over a year before they were identified and stopped,",
      " as the  following examples illustrate:  A soldier from an Army Reserve chemical unit in South Carolina  received an individual mobilization order in February 2003, but did not  mobilize with the unit. Nonetheless, her active duty pays and allowances  (a total of over $45,000) continued until they were stopped in April 2004. A soldier from a Louisiana Army Reserve unit received an individual  mobilization order in January 2003. However, the unit commander  determined the soldier should not be mobilized with the unit because he  had not yet completed required training. Nonetheless, the soldier  received active duty pays and allowances totaling over $25,",
      "000 until they  were stopped in March 2004. A soldier attached to a Puerto Rico Quartermaster Reserve unit was  mobilized in February 2003, but did not report for active duty. The  soldier continued to receive improper active duty pays and allowances  totaling about $36,000 until the payments were stopped in April 2004. A soldier assigned to an Illinois Reserve Military Police Company  received an individual mobilization order in December 2002. However,  she did not report to the mobilization station with her unit and her  mobilization order was revoked in January 2003. Nonetheless, the  soldier continued to receive active duty pay and allowances totaling  about $24,",
      "000 until the payments were stopped in April 2004. Army Reserve officials told us that these improper payments were not  identified through any systemic preventive accountability control process  associated with an active duty mobilization or demobilization, but rather as  a result of after the fact detective controls in place at the unit or the Army  Reserve pay center. For example, one soldier reported for a weekend drill  and the unit pay administrator attempted to enter a transaction to pay him  for weekend drill duties. However, the unit pay administrator discovered  the soldier\u2019s receipt of erroneous active duty payments when the weekend  drill pay transaction was rejected by DJMS-",
      "RC. Army Reserve officials told  us they have referred these improper payments to the Army\u2019s Criminal  Investigations Division to determine if criminal prosecution of the soldiers  involved may be warranted. Deployment Accountability Flaws in soldier accountability procedures associated with overseas  deployment locations resulted in late, under-, and overpayments of active  duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits associated with almost all the  soldiers in our case study units. Soldiers were generally paid late or  underpaid location-based incentives upon their initial arrival into  designated hardship duty and hostile fire locations. Subsequently, they  were often overpaid these same location-based entitlements because these  payments continued,",
      " sometimes for long periods of time, after soldiers left  designated overseas locations. These failures occurred because Army  procedures in place during our audit were ineffective in accounting for  when soldiers entered into and departed from designated hardship duty  and hostile fire locations. In addition, as discussed in a subsequent section  of this report, automated systems deficiencies also contributed to, and in  some cases exacerbated, location-based active duty pay problems. According to DFAS procedures, Army local area servicing finance locations  are to obtain documentation showing soldier and associated arrival and  departure date information to start and stop location-based pays,  allowances, and associated tax benefits. We were told that flight manifest  lists generated through the Army\u2019s Tactical Personnel System were the  primary source documents used as a basis for entering manual transactions  to start and stop location-based pays during most of our audit period.",
      " One of our case study units, the 443rd Military Police Company, relied on an  extraordinary, labor-intensive workaround to ensure that necessary  documentation supporting any changes in the location of the unit\u2019s  soldiers, as well as other pay-support documentation, was received by the  unit\u2019s area servicing finance office while the soldiers were deployed in Iraq. Individual Case Illustration: Biweekly Flights to Transmit Unit  Pay Documents While deployed to guard Iraqi prisoners at Camp Cropper in Iraq, the unit  commander of the 443rd Military Police Company assigned a sergeant to  help address myriad pay complaints. The sergeant was deployed to Iraq  as a cook,",
      " but was assigned to assist in pay administration for the unit  because he was knowledgeable in DJMS-RC procedures and pay-support  documentation requirements and was acquainted with one of the soldiers  assigned to the unit\u2019s servicing finance office in Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.  Every 2 weeks, for about 5 months, the sergeant gathered relevant pay- support documentation from the unit\u2019s soldiers, took a 1 hour and 15  minute flight to the Kuwait airport, and then drove an hour to the Army  finance office at Camp Arifjan. The day following the sergeant\u2019s biweekly  journey to Camp Arifjan, the sergeant worked with the Army finance  officials at Camp Arifjan to enter transactions into DMO,",
      " often for 8-12  hours, to get unit soldiers\u2019 pay entitlements started or corrected,  particularly hardship duty pay requiring manual input every month. However, despite diligent efforts by Army local area servicing finance  officials to develop and maintain accurate lists of soldiers at the designated  deployment locations, our analysis of payments to soldiers at our case  study units indicated that this information was often not timely or accurate.  Finance officials at the Army area servicing finance offices either did not  obtain manifests (documentation showing soldier arrival and departure  dates) at all, received the documentation late (often months after the unit\u2019s  actual arrival or departure dates), or obtained manifests listing soldiers  that should not have been included for pay purposes.",
      " For example, an  Army Reserve soldier assigned to support Air Force operations did not  process through, or have any access to, an Army location that could  provide a manifest showing his arrival date in-country to local Army area  servicing finance office officials so that they could start his location-based  pays. In this case, the soldier did not receive his location-based pays until  he returned to his demobilization station and insisted that personnel at that  location take the actions necessary to start this payment. Also, we were  told that soldiers departing from designated locations on emergency or rest  and recreation leave, who are still entitled to continue to receive  designated location-based pays while on such leave,",
      " were sometimes  erroneously included on departure manifests used as source documents to  stop active duty location-based pays. These flawed procedures, which were relied on to account for Army  Reserve soldiers\u2019 actual locations and their related pay entitlements while  deployed, resulted in pay problems in all seven of our case study units that  deployed soldiers overseas, as the following examples illustrate:   All 49 soldiers that deployed overseas with our 824th Quartermaster  Company case study unit were underpaid their hardship duty pay when  they first arrived in the country. Subsequently, almost all soldiers in the  unit were overpaid their hardship duty pay---most for up to 5 months-- after they left the designated location,",
      " and some continued to receive  these payments even after they were released from active duty. In total,  we identified about $30,000 in improper hardship duty payments  received by this unit\u2019s soldiers. Seventy-six soldiers with the 965th Dental Company received improper  hardship duty payments totaling almost $47,000 after they had left their  hardship duty location. Ten soldiers with the 431st Chemical Detachment received improper  hardship duty payments for 7 months after their return to their home  station. None of the 24 soldiers deployed with the 629th Transportation  Detachment received hardship duty pay for the months they arrived and  departed the hardship duty areas.",
      " In addition, they did not receive  hostile fire pay for almost 3 months after their arrival at their assigned  overseas deployment locations. The debts created by overpayment of these location-based payments  placed an additional administrative burden on both the soldiers and the  department to calculate, monitor, and collect the corrected amounts. Lack of Clear Pay Review  Procedures at Mobilization  Stations Some of the pay problems we found were associated with flawed  procedural requirements for the pay support review, which is part of the  SRP process carried out at Army mobilization stations. Procedures  followed by Army mobilization station finance officials during the SRP  were inconsistent with respect to what constitutes a \u201cthorough review\u201d of  soldiers\u2019 pay support documentation to determine if it is current and  complete and has been entered into the DJMS-",
      "RC pay system. Procedures followed for our 824th Quartermaster Company case study unit  at the Fort Bragg mobilization station provided that the pay support portion  of the SRP at that location consisted of finance representatives briefing the  entire unit on required pay support. Finance personnel did not meet  individually with each soldier to compare his or her pay support  documentation with on-line soldier pay data in DJMS-RC. As a result,  missing or outdated documentation required to support active duty pays  and allowances at the time of the 824th Quartermaster Company\u2019s SRP  contributed to some of the late payments we identified.",
      " For example, one  soldier with this unit who was certified as ready for mobilization as a result  of the SRP, did not receive entitled family separation allowance payments  because documentation necessary to start this allowance was not  submitted as part of the SRP process. Six months later, after the soldier  demobilized at Fort Bragg, the paperwork necessary to receive this  allowance was obtained and submitted for payment. This soldier received  about 6 months of back family separation allowance in September 2003  totaling $1,400. We also found indications that the pay support documentation review  carried out at the Army\u2019s Fort Lee mobilization station was less than  thorough.",
      " Personnel at the Fort Lee mobilization station did not carry out a  detailed review of Master Military Pay Account records, which would have  shown that soldiers with the unit would stop receiving their entitled  housing allowances and family separation allowances because there were  incorrect end dates for these payments entered into DJMS-RC. As a result,  several soldiers from the 443rd Military Police Company had their basic  allowance for housing switched to a rate less than the soldiers were  entitled to receive and had their family separation allowance stopped for a  period during their deployment because the Fort Lee mobilization station  finance personnel did not take action necessary to extend the end-of-",
      " eligibility dates for these two entitlements. In contrast, pay support documentation review procedures in place as part  of the SRP at the Army\u2019s mobilization stations at Fort McCoy and Fort  Eustis provided that, in addition to a unitwide finance briefing, finance  officials at those sites were to conduct one-on-one pay support  documentation reviews with each soldier. Members of the 948th Forward  Surgical Team, who mobilized through Fort McCoy, and the 629th  Transportation Detachment, who processed through Fort Eustis, had their  pay records reviewed and compared to DJMS-RC on-line records by  finance officials during the finance portion of their SRP.",
      " We found very few  problems with either the 948th or 629th units\u2019 active duty pay entitlements,  excluding in-theater entitlements, after these units passed through the one- on-one soldier pay documentation review as part of the SRP at Fort McCoy  and Fort Eustis. Inadequate Processes in  Place for Reconciling and  Distributing Key Pay and  Personnel Reconciliation  Reports Design flaws in the procedures in place to obtain and reconcile key pay and  personnel reports impaired the Army\u2019s ability to detect improper active  duty payments. As discussed previously, we identified several cases and the  Army has also identified a number of instances in which such improper  payments continued for over a year without detection.",
      " The reserve pay review and validation procedures for Army Reserve  soldiers were initially designed to service reservists as they perform  weekend drills, annual training, and short-term active duty mobilizations of  30 days or fewer. Correspondingly, pay and personnel reconciliation  processes in place during our audit were focused primarily on  requirements for unit commanders to reconcile data for reserve soldiers  while they are in an inactive (drilling reservist) status. However, as  illustrated by the pay problems discussed in this report, there is an equal or  even greater need to clearly establish required procedures for the review  and reconciliation of pay and related personnel data for Army Reserve  soldiers mobilized on extended active duty tours.",
      " Specifically, with respect to the monthly review and reconciliation of two  key reports, the Pay/Personnel Mismatch Report and the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report, current procedures contained in  USARC Pamphlet 37-1 provide that unit commanders are required to  review the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report for soldiers in their  units on weekend drill activities and for active duty mobilization planning  activities. However, these procedures do not clearly require unit  commanders to review this key report for Army Reserve soldiers in  subsequent phases of their active duty mobilization tours. Appendix I of  USARC Pamphlet 37-1 provides that unit pay data in the Unit Commander\u2019s  Pay Management Report should be reconciled with unit training and  attendance reports,",
      " but does not require reconciling pay data with related  data on mobilized soldiers. As a result, the unit commander at one of our  case study units, the 965th Dental Company, stated that he did not believe  that a review and reconciliation was needed. Instead, he stated he relied on  the unit\u2019s soldiers to identify any pay problems. In light of the extensive  manual entry, and nonintegrated systems currently relied on for mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 pay, the timely and complete reconciliation of  comparable pay and personnel data in these key reports can serve as an  important detective control to identify any pay errors shortly after they  have occurred.",
      " In addition, Army guidance does not specify how deployed units are to  receive these reports. Distribution of these reports is particularly  problematic for units deployed in remote locations overseas. As a matter of  practice, we found that for units in an inactive status, the unit\u2019s Regional  Readiness Command usually provides these reports. However, we also  found no procedural guidance in place to distribute the same reports to  unit commanders and administrators while their units are on active duty.  Unit commanders for several of our case study units stated they did not  receive these key reports while their units were deployed. Had those  reports been available and reconciled,",
      " they could have been used to  identify and correct improper active duty payments, such as the large,  erroneous active duty overpayments discussed previously. Procedures for Applying  Family Separation  Allowance Eligibility  Requirements Were Not  Clear The existing procedures for applying eligibility requirements for activated  Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 family separation allowance payments were not  clear. These flawed procedural requirements for paying the family  separation allowance led to varying interpretations and pay errors for Army  Reserve soldiers at the implementing Army home stations and mobilization  stations. DOD Financial Management Regulation (FMR) Volume 7A policy clearly  provides that soldiers are entitled to receive a family separation allowance  if their family does not reside near the duty station,",
      " which is generally  defined as within 50 miles. However, DOD procedures and the form  needed to implement this FMR policy were not clear. Implementing  guidance and DD Form 1561 (a document that must be completed to  receive the family separation allowance) do not provide for a  determination that a soldier\u2019s family does not live near the soldier\u2019s duty  station. Specifically, DD Form 1561 does not specifically require soldiers to  certify that the soldier is entitled to receive family separation allowance  benefits because (1) they live over 50 miles away from the unit\u2019s home  station and do not commute daily or (2)",
      " the soldier\u2019s commander has  certified that the soldier\u2019s required commute to the duty station is not  reasonable. We noted that in several of our case study units, soldiers began  receiving the family separation allowance while stationed in Army  installations less than 50 miles away from their residence and without any  documentation showing the unit commander\u2019s determination that the  soldier\u2019s commute, even though within 50 miles, was nonetheless,  unreasonable. For example, soldiers from the 824th Quartermaster  Company received family separation allowance payments while stationed  at their Fort Bragg home station, even though they lived within 50 miles of  the base and no documentation was available showing that the unit  commander authorized an exception.",
      " In contrast, 14 soldiers with  Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company who lived over 50 miles away  from their home station, including several soldiers from Puerto Rico, did  not receive a family separation allowance as of the date of their arrival at  their home station. Human Capital Issues  Affect Pay Accuracy  and Timeliness Human capital weaknesses also contributed to the pay problems mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers experienced in our eight case study units. Our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  effective human capital practices are critical to establishing and  maintaining a strong internal control environment, including actions to  ensure that an organization has the appropriate number of employees to  carry out assigned responsibilities.",
      " Even in an operational environment  supported by a well-designed set of policies and procedures and a world- class integrated set of automated pay and personnel systems, an effective  human capital strategy\u2014 directed at ensuring that sufficient numbers of  people, with the appropriate knowledge and skills, are assigned to carry  out the existing extensive, complex operational requirements\u2014is essential.  Such a human capital strategy supporting accurate and timely active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers must encompass potentially  hundreds of DOD components that are now involved in carrying out the  extensive coordination, manual intervention, and reconciliations required  to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Well-trained pay-support personnel throughout various DOD components  are particularly critical given the extensive,",
      " cumbersome, and labor- intensive process requirements that have evolved to provide active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. We encountered many  sincere and well-meaning Army, Army Reserve, and DFAS personnel  involved in authorizing and processing active duty payments to these  soldiers. The fact that mobilized Army Reserve soldiers received any of  their entitled active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits accurately and  on-time is largely due to the dedication and tireless efforts of many of these  pay-support personnel to do the right thing for these mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers. However, in conjunction with our case studies, we  observed human capital weaknesses related to (1)",
      " inadequate resources  provided to support unit-level pay management, (2) inadequate pay  management training across the spectrum of pay-support personnel, and  (3) customer service breakdowns. Inadequate Resourcing for  Critical Unit Administrator  Positions Vacancies and turnovers in key unit administrator positions, and the  deployment of unit administrators to fill other military requirements,  impaired a unit\u2019s ability to carry out critical pay administration tasks that  could have prevented or led to early detection of pay problems associated  with our case study units. In addition to pay administration responsibilities,  unit administrator duties include personnel and supply operations. We  were told that vacancies in unit administrator positions were difficult to fill  and often remained vacant for many months because Army policy requires  the individual filling the unit administrator position to have a dual status,",
      "  which means the individual must perform duties both in the capacity of an  Army Reserve military occupation specialty as well as unit administrator. For example, at the 948th Forward Surgical Team, the unit administrator  position was vacant prior to and during the unit\u2019s mobilization. We were  informed that the 948th Forward Surgical Team had difficulty filling the  vacancy because of its dual status. Specifically, the unit officials stated that  this position was difficult to fill because the individual must have a medical  background to meet the dual status requirement. That is, the person filling  the position must be able to meet the unit\u2019s mission requirements as well as  have knowledge and experience performing the personnel,",
      " payroll, and  supply tasks of a unit administrator. In the absence of a unit administrator,  the unit commander assigned a sergeant with limited knowledge of pay  entitlements and DJMS-RC processing requirements to help carry out some  of the unit administrator\u2019s pay management duties. The sergeant told us  that during a 2-week period during late April 2003, she spent about 100  hours attempting to resolve the unit\u2019s pay problems, while concurrently  carrying out her duties as a health specialist. Providing adequate resources to support the execution of critical pay  management responsibilities was particularly problematic for Army  Reserve soldiers that were cross-leveled (transferred)",
      " to other units and  mobilized to active duty with those units. For three of the four case study  units we audited where small groups of Army Reserve soldiers were  transferred and mobilized to active duty with another unit, we found that  these soldiers experienced pay problems that could be attributed, at least  in part, to inadequate resources to carry out critical unit-level pay  management responsibilities. For example, because he did not have any  unit-level support to assist in processing his active duty payments, a soldier  who was mobilized as a single-soldier unit did not receive any location- based active duty pays until he returned from Qatar.",
      " Inadequate Pay  Management Training In addition to concerns about the level of resources provided to support  critical unit administrator positions, we identified instances in which the  lack of adequate unit administrator and finance office personnel training on  pay management duties and responsibilities contributed to the soldiers\u2019 pay  problems we identified. In addition, we found that unit commanders did  not always support these important pay management duties. Our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that  management should establish and maintain a positive and supportive  attitude toward internal controls and conscientious management. Several of the individuals serving as unit administrators in our case study  units informed us that they had received limited or no formal training  covering unit administrator responsibilities and that the training they did  receive did not prepare them for mobilization issues associated with  supporting and processing active duty pays and allowances.",
      " Unit  administrators have responsibility for a variety of pay-related actions,  including working with the unit soldiers to obtain critical pay support  documentation, maintaining copies of pay support records, providing pay- transaction support documentation to the Reserve Pay Center, and  reviewing pay reports for errors. Without adequate training, unit  administrators may not be aware of these critical pay management  responsibilities. Few unit administrators at our case study units had completed all of the  required training on active duty pay and allowance eligibility and  processing requirements. While unit administrators are required to attend  two courses (each lasting 2 weeks), few of the unit administrators for our  case study units took the required training at or near the time they assumed  these important pay management and other key unit administrator duties.",
      "  For example, the unit administrator at one of our case study units, the 824th  Quartermaster Company, stated she had not attended any formal training  courses, but instead received on-the-job training. Our audit showed that  she did not always effectively carry out her pay management report review  responsibilities. For example, while our audit of unit pay reports showed  she reviewed the documents, we saw no indication she used this tool to  identify and stop an overpayment of $18,000 to one soldier in her unit. As a  result, the erroneous pay was allowed to continue for another 5 months. At other units,",
      " we identified instances in which available documentation  indicated that unit administrators did not take timely action to submit pay- support transactions. For example, several soldiers with the 965th Dental  Company did not receive promotion pay increases and other entitlements  for over 2 months because the unit administrator failed to process  necessary pay-support documentation, available at the time of the unit\u2019s  initial SRP, until the unit was already deployed on active duty. At the 443rd  Military Police Company, we found the unit\u2019s finance sergeant assigned  pay management responsibilities did not gather and submit current  documentation needed to support active duty pays and allowances,  including current documents showing soldiers\u2019 marital status and number  of dependents.",
      " As a result, soldiers from the 443rd Military Police Company  experienced over-, under-, and late payments associated with their housing  and cost of living allowances. In addition to inadequate unit administrator training, inadequate training of  military pay technicians at Army finance offices at mobilization stations,  area servicing finance offices (for deployed soldiers), and demobilization  stations adversely affected the accuracy and timeliness of payments to  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Few of the military finance personnel  responsible for processing pays and allowances at the mobilization and  demobilization stations and at the area servicing finance offices for  deployed units had formal training on DJMS-",
      "RC pay procedures. Instead,  several of the military pay technicians and supervisors we talked to at the  Army mobilization and demobilization stations told us they relied primarily  on on-the-job training to become knowledgeable in the pay eligibility and  pay transaction processing requirements for mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. For example, military pay personnel at the Defense Military Pay  Office at Fort Eustis informed us that they did not receive any formal  training on active duty pay entitlements or DJMS-RC pay processing before  assuming their assigned responsibilities for mobilization and  demobilization pay processing. Instead, they stated they became  knowledgeable in mobilization and demobilization pay processing  procedures by processing hundreds of soldiers within 2 to 3 weeks of being  assigned these responsibilities.",
      " They also said they contacted full-time  civilians in the finance office, as well as Reserve Pay Center and DFAS  officials, by telephone for assistance. Also, few of the Army finance personnel at overseas area servicing finance  offices were adequately trained in active duty pay entitlements and  processing procedures for mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Specifically,  these key personnel with responsibility for location-based active duty  payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers deployed in Kuwait and Iraq  and surrounding areas did not receive formal training on pay eligibility and  DJMS-RC processing requirements before assuming their duties. USARC  Pamphlet 37-1 provides that an Army in-theater servicing finance office has  primary responsibility for supporting active duty payments to mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers when a reserve unit is deployed overseas.",
      " Camp  Arifjan was the Army location assigned responsibility for processing active  duty payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers deployed in Kuwait and  Iraq during 2003. Officials from the 336th Command, the Army command  with oversight responsibility for Camp Arifjan, confirmed that while  finance personnel at Camp Arifjan received training in the pay eligibility  and pay processing procedures for active duty Army soldiers, they were not  adequately trained in pay eligibility issues of Army Reserve soldiers. We were told of instances in which Army finance personnel were unable to  help reserve soldiers resolve their pay problems. For example, the 948th  Forward Surgical Team contacted an Army finance unit located in  Kandahar,",
      " Afghanistan, to request its assistance in resolving the unit\u2019s pay  problems. However, the finance personnel at that location were unable to  help resolve the 948th Forward Surgical Team\u2019s pay problems because they  said they had not had training in this area and were not familiar with DJMS- RC processing requirements and procedures. All 20 soldiers with the 948th  Forward Surgical Team experienced pay problems associated with their  location-based payments related to their deployment in Afghanistan,  including hardship duty pay. These payments require manual entry every  month by the unit\u2019s area servicing finance office. Further, we saw little evidence that the unit commanders of our case study  units received any training for their role in supporting their unit  administrators in these important pay management responsibilities.",
      " For  example, at one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company, the unit  commander informed us that he did not support the review of pay  management reports because soldiers had the capability to review their pay  online and would use this capability to identify and report any pay  problems. However, as discussed previously, we identified a number of  instances in which soldiers did not identify or report that they received  thousands of dollars in improper active duty payments. Customer Service  Breakdowns Our audit work at eight case study units identified significant soldier  concerns with both the level and quality of customer service they received  related to their active duty pays,",
      " allowances, and tax benefits. The soldiers\u2019  concerns centered around three distinct areas: (1) the accessibility of  customer service, (2) the ability of customer service locations to help  soldiers, and (3) the treatment of soldiers requesting assistance. Servicing  soldiers and their families with pay inquiries and problems is particularly  critical in light of the error-prone processes and limited automated system  processing capabilities. Ultimately, pay accuracy is left largely to the  individual soldier. Although there are several sources that soldiers can turn to for pay issue  resolution, soldiers at our case study units experienced problems in  accessing these sources. Sources that soldiers can contact include their  home unit,",
      " the military pay section of the cognizant RRC, the  mobilization/demobilization station, the designated active Army area  servicing finance office in-theater, the online myPay system, and the 1-888- PAY-ARMY (729-2769) toll-free number. However, mission requirements  and the distance between deployment locations and field finance offices  often impaired the soldiers\u2019 ability to utilize the in-theater customer service  centers. Also, soldiers did not always have Internet and telephone access to  use the myPay system or to contact customer service sources such as 1- 888-PAY-",
      "ARMY, the home unit, or the cognizant RRC. The lack of Internet  access for deployed soldiers was particularly problematic because it  limited soldiers\u2019 access to pay, allowance, and tax benefit data reflected in  their leave and earnings statements. Lacking leave and earnings  statements, soldiers had no means to determine the propriety of their  active duty payments. For example, soldiers with the 948th Forward  Surgical Team told us that their inability to access the leave and earnings  statements adversely affected their overall morale. Even when mobilized reservists were able to contact customer service  sources, their pay issues often continued because the office they were  instructed to contact was unable to address their inquiry or correct their  problem.",
      " In some cases, customer service sources failed to help soldiers  because they lacked an understanding of what was needed to fix the  problems. When representatives of the 948th Forward Surgical Team  contacted their parent company for help in correcting pay problems,  personnel with the parent company informed them that they could not fix  the unit\u2019s pay problems because they (incorrectly) believed that the unit  was paid through the Army\u2019s active duty Army system. Soldiers at other  units were redirected from one source to another. Soldiers were not aware  of which sources could address which types of problems, and more  significantly, the customer service sources themselves often did not know  who should correct a specific problem.",
      " An Army Reserve major\u2019s experience illustrates the time and frustration  that was sometimes involved with soldiers\u2019 attempts to obtain customer  service for correcting errors in active duty pays, allowances, and related  tax benefits. Individual Case Illustration: Extensive, Time-consuming Action  Required to Resolve Pay Issue A soldier from Maryland was mobilized in March 2003 from the Army\u2019s  Individual Ready Reserve to active duty to serve as a liaison between the  Army and Air Force to help coordinate ground and air combat operations  in Iraq. After completing his 2-month active duty tour and returning to an  inactive reserve status in May 2003, he contacted Army officials to inform  them that he was continuing to receive active duty payments and  volunteered to immediately repay these erroneous overpayments.",
      " In July  2003, he wrote a check for $6,150.75 after receiving documentation  showing his debt computation. However, he continued to receive Leave  and Earnings Statements indicating that he had an outstanding debt. He  contacted his Army demobilization finance office to determine how to get  the erroneous outstanding debt removed from his pay records. After  being referred by officials at that location to various DFAS locations  (including once being told, \u201cThere is nothing more I can do for you.\u201d), he  contacted us for assistance. After DFAS recomputed the soldier\u2019s debt as  a result of our inquiry,",
      " the soldier was informed that he owed an  additional $1,140.54, because the original debt computation did not fully  consider the erroneous combat zone tax exclusion benefits he received.  Overall, he spent nearly a year after his 2-month active duty tour ended,  and about 20 phone calls, faxes, and letters in contacting at least seven  different DOD representatives at five different customer service centers  to correct active duty pay and allowance overpayments and associated  combat zone tax exclusion benefit problems. Finally, soldiers expressed concern about the treatment they sometimes  received while attempting to obtain customer service. Soldiers felt that  certain customer service representatives did not treat soldiers requesting  assistance with respect.",
      " For example, one soldier who attempted to make  corrections to his DD Form 214, Certificate of Discharge or Release from  Active Duty, informed us that mobilization station personnel told him that  the citations and dates of service he was trying to add \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d and  that he could fix them later. Additionally, some soldiers told us that while  they raised concerns about the quality of customer service they received  with respect to their pay inquiries and concerns, they were sometimes  ignored. For example, soldiers with Connecticut\u2019s 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment told us that while they contacted the local  Inspector General when they believed that finance personnel at their  deployment location had both actively tried to impair the payment of their  active duty entitlements and had tried to intimidate and discourage the  unit\u2019s soldiers from seeking help elsewhere,",
      " they were not aware of any  action taken as a result of their concerns. As a result, soldiers with the unit  told us they believed they had no recourse but to accept the poor treatment  they believed they received. Automated Systems  Deficiencies Constrain  Accurate and Timely  Payments Weaknesses in automated systems contributed significantly to the  underpayments, overpayments, and late payments we identified. These  weaknesses consisted of (1) nonintegrated systems with limited system  interfaces and (2) limited processing capabilities within the pay system.  The Army and DFAS rely on the same automated pay system to authorize  and process active duty payments for Army Reserve soldiers as they use for  Army National Guard soldiers.",
      " In addition, similar to the Army National  Guard, the Army Reserve\u2019s personnel and order-writing systems are not  integrated with the pay system. Consequently, many of the systems  problems experienced by mobilized Army Reserve soldiers were similar to  those that we identified in our report on pay issues associated with  mobilized Army National Guard soldiers. Because of the automated systems weaknesses, both Army Reserve and  active Army personnel must put forth significant manual effort to  accurately process pays and allowances for mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. Moreover, to compensate for the lack of automated controls over  the pay process, both DFAS and the Army place substantial reliance on the  review of pay reports to identify pay errors after the fact.",
      " Part of this  reliance includes the expectation that soldiers review their own leave and  earnings statements, even though these statements do not always provide  clear explanations of all payments made. Finally, because of DJMS-RC\u2019s  limitations, the system cannot simply stop withholding taxes for soldiers in  designated combat zone locations. Instead, for these soldiers, the system  withholds taxes and then reimburses the soldiers the amount that should  not have been withheld at least a month after the soldiers were first entitled  to receive this benefit. Automated Systems Are Not  Integrated and Have Limited  Interfaces The key pay and personnel systems involved in authorizing, entering,",
      "  processing, and paying mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are not integrated  and have only limited interfaces. Figure 2 provides an overview of the key  systems involved in authorizing, entering, processing, and making active  duty payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Lacking either an integrated or effectively interfaced set of personnel and  pay systems, DOD must rely on error-prone, manual data entry from the  same source documents into multiple systems. In an effectively integrated  system, changes to personnel records automatically update related payroll  records from a single source of data input. While not as efficient as an  integrated system, an automatic personnel-to-payroll system interface can  also reduce errors caused by repetitive manual data entry into more than  one system.",
      " Because of the lack of effective integration or interfaces among key  personnel and pay systems, pay-affecting data recorded in the personnel  system are not automatically updated in the pay system. Therefore, pay- affecting personnel changes recorded in the personnel system must be re- entered into the pay system from hard copies of documents, such as  soldiers\u2019 mobilization orders. We found numerous instances in which pay- affecting personnel information was not entered promptly into the pay  system, resulting in numerous pay errors. Individual Case Illustration: Overpayment due to Lack of  Integrated Personnel and Pay Systems A soldier assigned to an Illinois Military Police Company received a  mobilization order in December 2002 to report to Fort Dix,",
      " New Jersey.  Data from her individual mobilization order were entered into DJMS-RC  and she began receiving active duty pays and allowances based on the  active duty mobilization date shown in her mobilization order. However,  her mobilization order was revoked in early January 2003 after she was  found to be ineligible for mobilization. But, because of the lack of  integration or an effective interface between personnel and pay systems,  this order was not automatically processed in DJMS-RC to stop the  soldier\u2019s active duty pay. Consequently, the soldier was overpaid from  December 2002 through May 2004.",
      " Overpayments to the soldier totaled  over $24,000. We found several instances in which soldiers that were promoted while on  active duty did not receive their pay raises when they should have because  the promotion information was not promptly recorded in DJMS-RC. For  example, one Army Reserve soldier\u2019s promotion was effective on July 1,  2003. However, the soldier\u2019s promotion was not processed in the pay  system until October 2003, which delayed an increase in both his basic pay  and basic allowance for housing. The soldier finally received his promotion  pay, including back pay, in late October 2003,",
      " resulting in late payments  totaling over $2,700. Lacking an effective interface between pay and personnel systems, DOD  and the Army must rely on after-the-fact detective controls, such as pay and  personnel system data reconciliations, to identify and correct pay errors  occurring as a result of mismatches between personnel (TAPDB-R) and pay  system (DJMS-RC) data. In this regard, the Army Reserve has an automated  reconciliation tool\u2014the Participation Management and Reporting  Subsystem (PMARS)\u2014to help identify data inconsistencies between pay  and personnel systems. Specifically, the Army Reserve uses PMARS to  identify mismatches of soldiers accounted for in one system and not in the  other,",
      " and to compare the systems\u2019 information on individual soldiers, such  as their ranks and dates of service. However, this tool is not effective in  identifying soldiers that are being paid for active duty while in inactive  status because TAPDB-R currently does not capture and maintain this  information. Although TAPDB-R maintains a \u201cdeployability\u201d code, this code does not  necessarily indicate whether or not a soldier is on active duty. If TAPDB-R  included a code that specifically identified soldiers on active duty, then the  PMARS comparison of TAPDB-R data with DJMS-RC data could help  identify those soldiers improperly receiving active duty pay.",
      " Limited Automated  Processing Capabilities DJMS-RC was not designed to pay Army Reserve soldiers for active duty  tours longer than 30 days. According to DOD officials, requiring DJMS-RC  to process various types of pays and allowances for active duty tours that  exceed 30 days has stretched the system\u2019s automated processing  capabilities to the limit. Because of the system\u2019s limitations, the Army and  DFAS were required to make repetitive manual inputs for certain active  duty pays, such as hardship duty pay. We found many instances in which  these manual inputs resulted in payment errors. Moreover, because of the  way in which hardship duty pay was processed,",
      " mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers could not always determine whether they received all of their  entitled pays and allowances. In addition, under current processing  limitations, DJMS-RC does not process a required tax exclusion promptly  for soldiers in a combat zone, which has resulted in late payments of this  benefit for all entitled Army Reserve soldiers. Hardship Duty Pay During our audit period, we found numerous errors in hardship duty pay as  a result of a DJMS-RC processing limitation that required the use of a  miscellaneous payment code for processing this type of pay. Because of the  use of this miscellaneous code instead of a code specifically for hardship  duty pay,",
      " this pay could not be automatically generated on a monthly basis  once a soldier\u2019s eligibility was established. Therefore, hardship duty pay  had to be manually input every month for eligible soldiers. As previously  discussed, reliance on manual processing is more prone to payment errors  than automated processing. We found that nearly all soldiers in our case studies who were eligible for  hardship duty pay experienced problems with this pay, including late  payments, underpayments, and overpayments. For example, the 965th  Dental Company\u2019s soldiers at Seagoville, Texas, experienced both  underpayments and overpayments. Specifically, all 85 soldiers deployed to  Kuwait were underpaid a total of approximately $8,",
      "000 for hardship duty  pay they were entitled to receive during their deployment overseas.  Subsequently, 76 of the unit\u2019s soldiers were overpaid a total of almost  $47,000 because they continued to receive hardship duty payments for  more than 6 months after they had left the designated hardship duty  location. Both underpayments and overpayments, as well as late payments, of  hardship duty pay occurred largely because of the reliance on manual  processing of this pay every month. The errors often occurred because  local area servicing finance office personnel did not receive accurate or  timely documentation such as flight manifests or data from the Tactical  Personnel System indicating when soldiers arrived or left the designated  hardship duty location.",
      " As a result, finance personnel did not start these  payments on time, and did not stop these payments as of the end of the  soldiers\u2019 active duty tour date recorded in DJMS-RC. The DJMS-RC system processing limitation that led to using the systems\u2019  miscellaneous code to process hardship duty pay, also contributed to  overpayments of this active duty pay. That is, finance personnel mistakenly  continued to manually enter transactions to process hardship duty pay to  soldiers beyond soldiers\u2019 end of active tour dates because DFAS had no  way of implementing a system edit that could identify and stop erroneous  hardship duty pay while permitting other types of transactions processed  using this code to continue.",
      " Similarly, no edit was in place to prevent duplicate payments of hardship  duty pay. As a result, hardship duty pay could be entered more than once  for a soldier in a given month without detection. From our case studies, we  identified three soldiers who each received two hardship duty payments for  one month. None of these duplicate payments was identified or collected  until we submitted inquiries about these soldiers\u2019 payments to the Reserve  Pay Center. In addition, we were told that soldiers had difficulty  determining that they received duplicate hardship duty payments because  this type of payment was not clearly identified on their leave and earnings  statement. Use of the miscellaneous payment code also made it difficult for soldiers to  understand,",
      " and determine the propriety of, some of the payments  reflected on their leave and earnings statements. Hardship duty pay and  other payments that are processed using the miscellaneous payment code  are reported on leave and earnings statements as \u201cother credits.\u201d  Furthermore, the leave and earnings statements did not provide any  additional information about what the \u201cother credits\u201d were for unless pay  clerks entered additional explanations in the \u201cremarks\u201d section of the  statement, which they rarely did. As a result, soldiers often had no means  to determine if these types of payments were accurate. Unit commanders told us that they relied on soldiers to identify any pay  problems based on their review of their leave and earnings statements.",
      "  However, because leave and earnings statements do not always provide  adequate information or are not available to soldiers while they are  deployed, reliance on the soldiers to identify pay errors is not an effective  control. Combat Zone Tax Exclusion In addition to soldiers\u2019 pay problems that occurred primarily because of the  extensive use of manual processes, soldiers also experienced systematic  problems with automated payments related to their combat zone tax  exclusion, which resulted in late payments of this benefit for all soldiers in  the seven case study units that deployed overseas. Soldiers are entitled to  the combat zone tax exclusion for any month in which the soldier performs active service in a designated combat zone area.",
      " For any applicable  month, this benefit applies to the entire month, rather than being prorated  based on the number of days the soldier was in the combat zone. However, because DJMS-RC was designed as a pay system for inactive  Army Reserve soldiers, it does not have the processing capability to  suspend withholding of federal and state income taxes applicable to pay  that is ordinarily taxable. Instead, as a workaround procedure to  compensate for this limitation, the system first improperly withholds taxes  applicable to payments made while soldiers are in a combat zone, then  later reimburses soldiers for these withheld amounts in the following  month.",
      " For example, when an Army Reserve soldier is assigned to a  location where he is entitled to receive tax-free active duty pays, DJMS-RC  (improperly) withholds taxes from at least the soldier\u2019s first one or two  active duty payments. Subsequently, during the first pay cycle of the  following month, DJMS-RC reimburses the soldier for the amount of taxes  improperly withheld during the previous month. As a result of this  workaround process, all Army Reserve soldiers who served in a combat  zone received their combat zone tax exclusion benefit at least one month  late. DJMS-RC processing limitations cause further delays in soldiers\u2019 receipt of  entitled combat zone tax benefits when soldiers arrived in a combat zone  after the midmonth cutoff,",
      " which is approximately on the 7th day of each  month. In these cases, entitlement to the tax exclusion is not recognized  until the following month, which then delays the soldier\u2019s receipt of his  combat zone tax benefit until the next month\u2014the third month the soldier  is deployed in the combat zone. For example, members of the 824th  Quartermaster Company that deployed to Afghanistan arrived in country  on July 14, 2003, but did not receive their first combat zone tax exclusion  reimbursements until early October, almost 3 months after they became  eligible for the exclusion. Recent Actions Should  Result in  Improvements DOD and the Army have reported a number of relatively recent positive  actions with respect to processes,",
      " human capital practices, and automated  systems that, if implemented as reported, should improve the accuracy and  timeliness of active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits  provided to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. The accuracy and timeliness  of payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers rely on many of the same  processes and automated systems used for payments to mobilized Army  National Guard soldiers. Consequently, actions to improve the accuracy  and timeliness of Army Reserve soldier payments are closely tied to actions  taken in response to several of the recommendations in our November 2003  Army National Guard pay report. Because many of DOD\u2019s actions in this area were implemented in the fall of  2003 or later,",
      " they were not in place soon enough to have had a positive  impact on mobilized Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 payments as of the January  2004 cutoff for the soldier pay data we audited. However, if implemented as  reported to us, many of DOD\u2019s actions in response to our November 2003  report recommendations should help reduce the incidence of the types of  pay problems we identified for Army National Guard soldiers as well as  those identified in the Army Reserve case study units discussed in this  report. With respect to the process deficiencies and related recommendations,  DOD reported implementing additional procedural guidance intended to  help minimize the pay problems attributable to nonstandard or unclear  procedures.",
      " For example, in June 2004, the Army issued a comprehensive  \u201cFinance Mobilization and Demobilization Standing Operating Procedure.\u201d  This guidance clarified pay management responsibilities and transaction  processing requirements to be followed for all Army Reserve and Army  National Guard soldiers mobilized to active duty. One of the purposes of  this guidance is to eliminate any questions regarding which DOD entity is  responsible for resolving a soldier\u2019s pay issues or questions. Further, as of  January 2004, DOD reported establishing a new procedure under which  DFAS assumed responsibility (from the Army finance offices located in  various overseas locations) for all monthly manual entry of mobilized Army  Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers\u2019 location-based hardship duty  pay.",
      " DOD also reported completing several actions related to our previous  recommendations to improve the human capital practices related to  payments to mobilized Army soldiers. For example, the Army reported that  it had taken action to provide additional training for Army finance  personnel at overseas finance locations, mobilization and demobilization  stations, and for those Army finance personnel scheduled for deployment.  This training is directed at better ensuring that these personnel are  adequately trained on existing and new pay eligibility and pay processing  requirements for mobilized Army National Guard and Army Reserve  soldiers. DOD also reported establishing a new policy in January 2004  directed at more clearly affixing responsibility for addressing soldiers\u2019 pay  problems or inquiries.",
      " Under this new policy, the Army National Guard  established a pay ombudsman to serve as the single focal point for ensuring  coordinated, prompt customer service on all Army National Guard soldiers\u2019  pay problems. Thus far, DOD\u2019s reported actions have not yet addressed,  and consequently we are reiterating, our previous human capital  recommendations with respect to (1) requiring unit commanders to receive  training on the importance of adhering to requirements to carry out  monthly pay management responsibilities, and (2) modifying existing  training policies and procedures to require active Army pay and finance  personnel who are responsible for entering pay transactions for mobilized  reserve component soldiers to receive appropriate training upon assuming  such duties.",
      " With respect to automated systems, the Army and DFAS have  acknowledged serious deficiencies in the current automated systems used  to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers, and report that they have  implemented a number of significant improvements, particularly to reduce  an estimated 67,000 manual monthly entries for hardship duty pay. For  example, in response to our recommendations in the Army National Guard  report, DOD reported taking actions to (1) automate manual monthly  hardship duty pay in April 2004, (2) eliminate the use of the miscellaneous  code for processing hardship duty pay and instead process these payments  using a unique transaction code to facilitate implementing a system edit to  identify and stop erroneous payments,",
      " (3) compare active duty release  dates in the Army\u2019s system used to generate Release From Active Duty  orders with soldiers\u2019 end of active duty tour dates shown in DJMS-RC to  identify and stop any erroneous active duty pays, and (4) increase the  reliability and timeliness of documentation used to support soldiers\u2019 arrival  at and departure from designated overseas locations. However, DOD has not yet fully addressed, and consequently we are  reiterating two of our previous recommendations directed at interim  automated system improvements and one of our longer-term system  improvement recommendations. Specifically, we are reiterating previous  interim recommendations related to evaluating the feasibility of (1)",
      " using  the personnel-to-pay interface as a means to proactively alert pay  personnel of actions needed to start active duty pays and allowances and  (2) establishing an edit check and requiring approval before processing any  payments above a specified dollar amount. DOD has a major system enhancement effort under way in this area\u2014the  Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS). As an  interim measure, DOD is now pursuing Forward Compatible Payroll (FCP).  FCP is intended to replace payroll systems now used to pay Army military  personnel and help eliminate several of the labor-intensive, error-prone  workarounds necessitated by current DJMS-",
      "RC processing limitations. As  of May 2004, FCP was expected to be operational for all Army Reserve  soldiers by March 2005. We are also reiterating our previous longer term recommendation with  respect to taking action to ensure that DIMHRS and related efforts include  a complete reengineering of not only the related automated systems, but  the supporting processes and human capital practices used to pay  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers as well. Such fundamental reengineering  is necessary because, as discussed in the preceding sections, many of the  pay problems we found were associated with procedural and human  capital practice issues, as well as nonintegrated automated systems that  extend beyond existing pay system processing limitations.",
      " Conclusions The increased operating tempo for Army Reserve and Army National Guard  active duty mobilizations has stressed the current processes, human  capital, and automated systems relied on to pay these soldiers. The  significant number of problems we identified associated with active duty  pays, allowances, and related tax benefits provided to mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers at eight case study locations raises serious concerns about  whether current operations can be relied on to provide accurate and timely  payments. These pay problems caused considerable frustration, adversely  affected soldiers\u2019 morale, and placed an additional, unnecessary burden on  both the soldiers and their families. Further, if not effectively addressed,",
      "  these pay problems may ultimately have an adverse impact on Army  Reserve reenlistment and retention. Strengthening existing processes, human capital practices, and automated  systems is critical to preventing, or at minimum, promptly detecting and  correcting, the errors we identified. In this regard, DOD and the Army have  reported a number of relatively recent positive actions intended to improve  the accuracy and timeliness of active duty pays, allowances, and related tax  benefits provided to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. DOD\u2019s completed  and planned near-term actions, if implemented as reported, should reduce  the number of pay problems. However,",
      " mobilized Army Reserve soldiers  cannot be reasonably assured of accurate and timely active duty pays,  allowances, and related tax benefits until DOD completes a reengineering  of all the processes, human capital practices, and automated systems  supporting this critical area. Fully and effectively addressing Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 pay problems will  require priority attention and sustained, concerted, coordinated efforts by  DFAS, the Army, and the Army Reserve to build on actions taken and  planned. For these reasons, we are reaffirming two of our previous human  capital-related recommendations and three of our previous automated  systems-related recommendations from our November 2003 report on  payments to mobilized Army National Guard soldiers.",
      " However, we are also  offering 15 additional recommendations identified as a result of our audit  of mobilized Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 pay experiences. Recommendations for  Executive Action We recommend that the Secretary of the Army, in conjunction with the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), take the following 15 actions to  address the issues we found with respect to the existing processes,  personnel (human capital), and automated systems relied on to pay  activated Army Reserve soldiers. Establish procedures for unit commanders and unit administrators, or  other designated officials (for soldiers transferred between units), to  reconcile the names of Army Reserve soldiers receiving active duty pay  with the names of Army Reserve soldiers reporting for duty at  mobilization stations.",
      " Establish procedures for unit commanders and unit administrators, or  other designated officials, to provide the names and arrival dates for all  soldiers entering and exiting in-theater locations to a designated area  servicing finance office to facilitate accurate and timely payment of in- theater location-based active duty pays, allowances, and related tax  benefits. Establish procedures to provide demobilization stations with a list of  soldiers returning from overseas that are scheduled to arrive at the  demobilization station for outprocessing. Establish procedures to reconcile the names of Army Reserve soldiers  who recently demobilized with the names of Army Reserve soldiers still  receiving mobilization pay and take appropriate action to resolve any  identified pay issues.",
      " Clarify policy concerning \u201cthorough\u201d review of soldiers\u2019 pay records  upon initial mobilization to specify that finance personnel at Army  mobilization stations must conduct a one-on-one review of online pay  records for each mobilized soldier. Establish procedures to ensure unit commanders and unit  administrators, or other designated officials, have online access to pay  management reports, such as the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management  Report, particularly for mobilized units. Clarify DJMS-RC procedures to specifically require unit commanders,  unit administrators, or other designated officials to review and reconcile  key pay and personnel data every month, including personnel records,  with the monthly Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report,",
      " for all  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers. Clarify and simplify procedures and forms implementing the family  separation allowance entitlement policy, particularly with respect to the  30-day waiting period and commuting distance criteria. Take appropriate action to address the issues of inadequate resources  provided to carry out key unit administrator pay management  responsibilities identified at our case study units, particularly with  respect to (1) vacancies in unit administrator positions resulting from  the requirement for dual status unit administrators and (2) lack of pay  management support for Army Reserve soldiers transferred between  units. Determine whether issues of inadequate resources identified at our case  study units apply to other mobilized Army Reserve units and soldiers,",
      "  and if so, take appropriate action to address any deficiencies identified. Evaluate the feasibility of establishing an ombudsman to serve as the  single focal point and have overall coordination responsibility and  visibility to ensure that all Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 problems and  inquiries with respect to applicable active duty pays, allowances, and  related combat zone tax exclusion benefits are promptly and fully  resolved. Interim Improvements to Current Automated Systems  Evaluate the feasibility of modifying the deployability code or adding  a duty status code in TAPDB-R that can be compared with the pay  status code field in DJMS-RC to assist in identifying pay errors  resulting from discrepancies between the soldiers\u2019 duty status and  pay status.",
      " Evaluate the feasibility of modifying DJMS-RC to suspend  withholding taxes from soldiers when they serve in designated tax- exempt combat zones. Evaluate the feasibility of establishing a system edit to prevent DJMS- RC from generating payments for active duty service to soldiers after  their date of demobilization from active duty. Address the deficiencies noted in this report as part of the functional  requirements for the FCP and DIMHRS system development efforts  currently under way.

From the population of Army Reserve units mobilized and demobilized  between August 2002 and January 2004, we selected units from various  specialties that represented the wide variety of missions performed by the  Army Reserve during wartime. These case studies are presented to provide  a more detailed view of the types and causes of any pay problems  experienced by these units as well as the financial impact of pay problems  on individual soldiers and their families. We used mobilization data supplied by the Army Reserve Headquarters  Operations Center to assist us in selecting the eight units we used as our  case studies. We did not independently verify the reliability of the  Operations Center database.",
      " We used the data to select RRCs that had a  large number of activated Reserve units that had mobilized, deployed, and  returned from their tour of active duty in support of Operations Noble  Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. From the list of units  assigned to these Readiness Commands, we selected our eight case studies  that had a variety of deployment locations and missions, including both  overseas and continental U.S. deployments. In addition to our case studies,  during our visits to Army mobilization locations, we interviewed small  numbers of soldiers currently in the process of returning from active duty  to obtain their perspectives on their experiences with active duty pays,",
      "  allowances, and related tax benefits. We also obtained testimonial data from soldiers at several of our case study  units. We asked numerous soldiers at these units to discuss pay-related  experiences during their deployment. The information we obtained during  these interviews is presented to provide further insight into the pay  experiences of Army Reserve soldiers who were mobilized under current  military operations, but is not intended to be representative of the views of  all soldiers in their units nor of those of Army Reserve soldiers overall. We used DJMS-RC pay transaction extracts for the period from August 2002  through January 2004 to identify pay problems associated with our case  study units.",
      " However, we did not perform an exact calculation of the net  pay soldiers should have received in comparison with what DJMS-RC  records show they received. Rather, we used available documentation and  follow-up inquiries with cognizant personnel at the Army Reserve  Command, Regional Readiness Commands, and the Reserve Pay Center at  Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, to determine if (1) soldiers\u2019 entitled active duty pay  and allowances were received within 30 days of their initial mobilization  date, (2) soldiers were paid within 30 days of the date they became eligible  for active duty pay, allowances, and entitlements associated with their  deployment locations,",
      " and (3) soldiers stopped receiving active duty pay  and allowances as of the date of their demobilization from active duty. For  the pay problems we identified, we counted them as problems only in the  phase (mobilization, deployment, and demobilization) in which they first  occurred even if the problems persisted into other phases. For purposes of  characterizing pay and allowance problems for this report, we defined  overpayments and underpayments as those that were in excess of  (overpayment) or less than (underpayment) the entitled payment. We  considered as late payments any active duty pay or allowance paid to the  soldier over 30 days after the date on which the soldier was entitled to  receive such payments.",
      " As such, these payments were those that, although  late, addressed a previously unpaid entitlement. We used available data  through February 2004, as well as dollar amounts reported by Reserve Pay  Center officials, to determine collections against identified overpayments  through February 2004. In addition, while we did not attempt to calculate  the exact impact of any soldier\u2019s over-, under-, and late payments on their  combat zone tax exclusion benefits, we did examine readily available data  to determine the extent to which our case study unit soldiers\u2019 received their  entitled combat zone tax exclusion benefits. Our audit results only reflect problems we identified.",
      " Soldiers in our case  study units may have experienced additional pay problems that we did not  identify. Further, our work was not designed to identify, and we did not  identify, any fraudulent pay and allowances to any mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. However, to the extent we identified any problems with our case  study unit soldiers\u2019 active duty pays, allowances, tax benefits, and related  collections, we provided documentation showing the results of our analysis  to appropriate Army Reserve officials for a complete review of all soldier  pay records to determine whether, and take appropriate action if,  additional amounts are owed to the Army Reserve soldiers or to the  government.",
      " We briefed officials of the DOD Comptroller, Army Finance Command,  Army Reserve Command, Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands,  Army Forces Command, and DFAS-Indianapolis on the details of our audit,  including our findings and their implications. On July 9, 2004, we requested  comments on a draft of this report. We received comments on August 11,  2004, from the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and have  summarized those comments in the section of this report entitled \u201cAgency  Comments and Our Evaluation.\u201d DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix X.",
      " We conducted our audit from November 2003 through June  2004 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing  standards. 824th Quartermaster Company, Fort Bragg,  North Carolina Beginning on February 2, 2003, the 824th Quartermaster Company was  called to active duty for up to a year in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom. A total of 68 soldiers from the 824th Quartermaster Company  mobilized at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and went through in-processing at  Fort Bragg\u2019s mobilization station in the first few weeks of February.",
      " Over  the next several months, members of the unit performed their mission of  rigging parachutes for individual soldiers and large equipment drops at Fort  Bragg, in Afghanistan, and in and around Kuwait. On April 6, 2003, 44  members of the 824th Quartermaster Company deployed to Kuwait to assist  in parachute preparations. After completing their mission, the soldiers  returned to Fort Bragg 2 months later on June 19. Another 5 soldiers from  the unit deployed to Afghanistan on July 14 and performed similar  parachute rigging duties, returning to Fort Bragg on September 1,",
      " 2003. The  other 19 soldiers in the unit remained at Fort Bragg for the entire duration  of their tour of duty where they assisted in parachute rigging at the base.  Beginning on July 15, 2003, soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company  began to demobilize and return to their civilian jobs, and by the end of  September 2003, all but one soldier had been released from active duty. The  soldier that remained on active duty was receiving medical treatment for  injuries related to his military service. A time line of actions associated  with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is shown in figure 3.",
      " As summarized in table 4, at every stage of the unit\u2019s tour of active duty,  soldiers experienced a variety of pay problems. Fifty-eight of the 68  soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company experienced at least one pay  problem associated with their activation to, during, or deactivation from  active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, (1) we  found that 11 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late  payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 50 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active  duty at Fort Bragg,",
      " in Afghanistan, and in and around Kuwait, including in- theater incentives such as hostile fire pay; and (3) 13 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, and/or late payments associated with their  demobilization, with most of the problems relating to the continuation of  active duty pay after demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments, underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $60,000, $10,000, and  $3,000, respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $2,000 was  subsequently collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers. Almost $18,",
      "000 of the  overpayments we identified was associated with one soldier, who  continued to receive active duty pay for more than 5 months after his  discharge from the Army. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 5, we found that 11 soldiers from the 824th  Quartermaster Company experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments related to basic pay and associated entitlements when called  to active duty. For example, we identified several soldiers who received  their $250 per month family separation allowance even though they  performed their military duty at Fort Bragg, their home station, and were  not separated from their families as provided by the DOD FMR Volume 7A.",
      "  The soldiers were not informed by pay technicians at the unit or their  mobilization station that they were not entitled to the family separation  allowance if their home of record was within a reasonable commuting  distance, generally 50 miles, even though the soldiers were staying at Fort  Bragg. Prior to being mobilized, the soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company  attended a SRP at their unit\u2019s home station. The purpose of this review was  to ensure that all soldiers had all required administrative paperwork,  financial documents, and were physically fit for the ensuing mobilization.  Members of the 81st Regional Readiness Command and unit members of the  824th Quartermaster Company,",
      " who conducted the finance portion of the  SRP, were required to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial  documentation, and, if necessary, submit transactions with the necessary  supporting documentation to the Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy to  update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay Accounts to reflect their mobilized  status. After performing the SRP at the unit\u2019s home station, the 824th  Quartermaster Company reported to Fort Bragg, its active Army  mobilization station. Fort Bragg personnel conducted a second SRP that  was intended, in part, to verify each soldier\u2019s pay account with supporting  finance documents. However,",
      " instead of conducting the required review of  each soldier\u2019s pay record, Fort Bragg\u2019s finance personnel performed only a  perfunctory review of the soldiers\u2019 supporting documents. According to  finance personnel at Fort Bragg\u2019s mobilization station, the physical layout  of the in-processing station did not allow them to sit with each soldier \u201cone  on one\u201d to compare their pay account as shown in DJMS-RC with the  soldier\u2019s pay supporting documentation in real time. The perfunctory review and oversights during the SRPs at the home station  and mobilization station allowed several soldiers to receive FSA when they  were not entitled to receive it.",
      " A review by personnel at the SRP should  have identified that the soldiers were not separated from their families as  required, and therefore they would not have signed off as approvers of the  entitlement forms. A lack of adequately trained staff with enough time to  review the unit\u2019s pay forms may have caused this pay error. Missing or noncurrent documentation required to support active duty pays  and allowances at the time of the SRP contributed to some of the late pays  and allowance payments we identified. For example, one soldier did not  receive family separation allowance payments because documentation  necessary to start this allowance was not submitted as part of the SRP  process,",
      " although the soldier was certified as ready for mobilization as a  result of the SRP. It was 6 months later, when the soldiers were  demobilizing at Fort Bragg, that the paperwork necessary to receive this  allowance was submitted to the Fort Bragg finance office. This soldier  received about 6 months of back pay in September 2003. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 6, we identified a number of problems associated  with the unit\u2019s active duty pays and allowances. During the soldiers\u2019 deployment to Afghanistan and Kuwait, they  encountered pay problems related to payments for soldiers located in  designated hardship duty locations and hostile fire zones.",
      " Most soldiers did  not receive the full amount of hardship duty pay payments while deployed.  In addition, they continued to receive their hardship duty pay well after  they had returned to Fort Bragg and demobilized. All 49 soldiers deployed  overseas were incorrectly paid for either hardship duty or hostile fire pay. Army area servicing finance officials, who had responsibility for initiating  these entitlements, did not initiate the unit\u2019s hardship duty pay payments  until several months after the unit had arrived. The delay resulted in the  deployed soldiers being underpaid for most of their time in the hardship  duty location. Local active Army finance officials also did not terminate payments of  hardship duty pay until 5 months after the soldiers had left the hardship  duty pay location,",
      " in most cases. This erroneous continuation of hardship  duty payments may have been the result of pay clerks continuing to  manually process these payments each month using a roster of soldiers in  the country that did not properly reflect the unit\u2019s departure from the  overseas deployment location. In addition, the DJMS-RC system processing  procedures in place at the time required that hardship duty pay be  processed using a miscellaneous payment code that could be used for a  variety of payments. The use of this miscellaneous code for hardship duty  pay precluded the system from identifying the payments as active duty pay  and therefore allowed these payments to continue after the soldiers were  demobilized.",
      " The use of the miscellaneous payment code also led to soldier  confusion because the Leave and Earning Statement did not identify the  nature of the entitlement. In addition, soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan told us that in some  cases, they had trouble finding in-theater finance officers willing to help  them with their pay problems. The soldiers stated that when they arrived in  Afghanistan, the finance office on duty at the time was preparing to return  to the United States because its tour in the country was ending. Several  weeks passed before the transition of finance offices was complete, and in  that time the Reserve soldiers did not have any local support that would  assist them with finance problems.",
      " This gap in a functioning supporting  finance office for the deployed soldiers could only have added to their  frustration and confusion over in-theater pays. In addition to the problems soldiers experienced related to their pay and  entitlements, they also experienced systematic problems related to their  combat zone tax exclusion benefits. All 49 of the soldiers from the 824th  Quartermaster Company who deployed overseas were eligible for this tax  benefit and all of them experienced some type of problem with their  combat zone tax exclusion. Specifically, we found that all 49 soldiers  received their combat zone tax exclusion late, totaling about $20,000. Five  soldiers did not receive all of the combat zone tax exclusion benefits they  were due during their deployment.",
      " Moreover, the soldiers who deployed to  Afghanistan did not have the combat zone tax exclusion applied to their  pay until nearly 3 months after they arrived in the country, and never  received their combat zone tax exclusion benefit for September 2003. The  error for the month of September caused over $1,300 of extra taxes to be  collected from these soldiers while in a combat zone. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Soldiers of the 824th Quartermaster Company began to demobilize in July  2003. As summarized in table 7, during their demobilization and after their  release from active duty,",
      " soldiers continued to experience pay problems.  These problems were primarily overpayments associated with soldiers  receiving pay after their active duty demobilization dates. The largest pay problem related to the 824th Quartermaster Company\u2019s  demobilization involved a soldier who was put into a medical hold  company. The soldier initially mobilized with the unit in February, and was  in-processed by personnel at Fort Bragg. During the in-processing, it was  determined that the soldier had a medical condition that did not allow him  to mobilize with the unit and perform his duty. He was then transferred to a  medical holding company under the command of the Fort Bragg Garrison  Support Unit.",
      " In this unit, the soldier underwent treatment for his condition  and concluded that treatment in August 2003. On August 13, 2003, the  soldier was discharged entirely from the Army and his pay should have  stopped on that date. According to DFAS guidance, several locations can  initiate transactions to stop a soldier\u2019s pay. The primary location is the  demobilization station where the soldier receives his or her DD Form 214,  Certificate of Discharge or Release from Active Duty. As a secondary catch,  the Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy can also stop the soldier\u2019s pay on his  or her release date.",
      " Although the soldier did out-process through Fort Bragg and received his  DD Form 214, personnel at the demobilization station at Fort Bragg did not  amend the soldier\u2019s pay record to cut off pay on August 13. The unit also  did not take any action to stop the soldier\u2019s pay because the soldier should  have been off of its pay records and in the pay records of the medical hold  company. This had not been done and the result was that the medical hold  company could not view the soldier\u2019s pay records but knew he was  discharged. Meanwhile, the unit could view the pay records but, under  current procedures,",
      " did not receive a copy of the DD Form 214 showing the  soldier had been discharged. Ultimately, the soldier\u2019s pay and allowances  were stopped only as a result of actions we took. Specifically, in August  2003, the soldier contacted his old unit, the 824th Quartermaster Company,  and faxed them a copy of his DD Form 214. At this point the unit had all  necessary documentation to identify the overpayment to the soldier after  his discharge date of August 13, but did not review the pay records and  identify the problem. The soldier continued to get paid until the end of  January 2004 when we identified the error,",
      " which resulted in an  overpayment of almost $18,000. Finally, after we brought the error to the  unit\u2019s attention, the unit requested that the Reserve Pay Center at Fort  McCoy stop the soldier\u2019s pay and initiate collection. 965th Dental Company Seagoville, Texas On February 9, 2003, the 965th Dental Company was called to active duty in  support of Operation Enduring Freedom for an initial 1-year tour. The unit  mobilized at its home station, Seagoville, Texas, on February 11, 2003, and  reported for active duty at Fort Hood,",
      " Texas, on February 14, 2003. On  March 23, 2003, the 965th Dental Company deployed to Camp Arifjan,  Kuwait, to provide dental services to Army soldiers involved in military  operations in Iraq and surrounding areas. Upon completion of its mission,  the company redeployed from Kuwait to Fort Hood in two separate groups;  the first group returned on May 22, 2003, and the second on June 10, 2003.  Within a few days of returning to Fort Hood, soldiers were sent home and  following end-of-tour leave were discharged from active duty.",
      " By the end of  July 2003, all but three soldiers had been released from active duty. Two  soldiers remained on active duty because they were still receiving medical  treatment for injuries sustained during their deployment and one was still  deployed overseas at the time of our review. A time line of actions  associated with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is shown in figure 4. As summarized in table 8, soldiers of the 965th Dental Company  experienced various pay problems at every stage of the unit\u2019s tour of active  duty. Overall, 89 of 93 mobilized soldiers experienced some type of pay  problem associated with their activation to,",
      " during, or deactivation from,  active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, 25  soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late payments  associated with their initial mobilization; 86 experienced underpayments,  overpayments, or late payments during their deployment to areas in and  around Kuwait, including in-theater incentives such as hostile fire pay and  hardship duty pay; and 7 soldiers experienced underpayments or  overpayments associated with their demobilization, including problems  related to the continuation of active duty pay after demobilization. One  soldier received $36,000 of active duty pay even though he never mobilized  with the unit.",
      " Another soldier incorrectly received hostile fire pay, hardship  duty pay, the family separation allowance, and the combat zone tax  exclusion benefit following his return home to recuperate from injuries  sustained overseas. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments, underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $100,000, $16,000, and  $27,000, respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $400 was  subsequently collected from the soldiers prior to the time we started our  audit. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 9, we found that 25 soldiers from the 965th Dental  Company experienced underpayments,",
      " overpayments, or late payments  related to basic pay and associated entitlements during mobilization  processing. The unit administrator conducted a premobilization SRP review during  October 2002 at the unit\u2019s home station. However, according to the unit  administrator, about 30 to 40 soldiers did not attend the SRP session  because the soldiers would have had to travel from distant locations, such  as Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they typically attended Army Reserve  inactive duty training, or for other reasons. Thus, when these soldiers  arrived at the unit\u2019s home station prior to reporting to Fort Hood, the unit  administrator quickly performed the SRP process for them at that time.",
      "  However, instead of submitting necessary changes to soldiers\u2019 pay  accounts to the Reserve Pay Center, the unit administrator waited until the  unit arrived at the Fort Hood mobilization station to submit them.  According to documentation obtained from the Reserve Pay Center, some  soldiers\u2019 documentation was not submitted until March 22, 2003, a month  after the unit was mobilized. As a result, promotion pay increases and other  entitlements were paid over 2 months late. For 3 soldiers, correct  entitlements were not received until the soldiers returned from their  overseas tour. Delays in submitting required forms and documentation were the primary  causes for late pay and entitlements.",
      " Also, three soldiers were overpaid pay  and benefits because their active duty pay was started too early. These  minor overpayments were collected from the soldiers\u2019 pay during  demobilization out-processing. One soldier received double the amount of  basic allowance for housing, for an estimated overpayment of $6,600. In  addition, the process of paying soldiers their family separation allowance  was not consistently applied for the soldiers of the 965th Dental Company.  For example, a soldier from Gulfport, Mississippi, was paid family  separation allowance during his commute to the mobilization station;  however, a soldier from Claremore,",
      " Oklahoma, was not. The lack of accountability for deploying soldiers resulted in one unit  soldier being paid active duty pay even though the soldier never mobilized  with the unit. This soldier received orders to mobilize with the unit, but  because the soldier had a disability that prevented his serving on active  duty, the unit commander excused the soldier from mobilization. However,  although unit personnel transferred the soldier to another unit that was not  mobilizing, no one canceled the soldier\u2019s original mobilization order in the  Army Reserve personnel system, or notified the Reserve Pay Center to stop  the soldier\u2019s active duty pay. In addition,",
      " unit personnel did not notify the  Fort Hood mobilization station that this soldier had received a mobilization  order so the mobilization station could confirm that the order had been  revoked and stop pay for this soldier. Further, the soldier receiving the  unauthorized pay did not report the overpayments to the unit to which he  had been transferred. Thus, the soldier received approximately $36,000 of  active duty pay for which he was not entitled. These overpayments  continued for more than 12 months and were not identified until we  discovered them during our visit to the unit in January 2004. During our visit to the home station,",
      " we informed the unit commander  about the soldier\u2019s overpayment and he stated that this soldier should not  be held responsible for repaying the overpayment because he believed the  soldier did nothing wrong or illegal. He also stated that he did not review  the Unit Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report because the soldiers were  able to review their pay online. It is likely that the improper payments to  this soldier would have been identified if either the unit commander or unit  administrator had monitored the unit\u2019s pay reports. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 10, we identified extensive problems associated  with active duty pays and allowances applicable to the unit\u2019s overseas  deployment to Kuwait.",
      " In total, 86 soldiers experienced some type of pay  problem during the deployed phase, including one soldier who did not  deploy overseas, but received in-theatre incentives. During the unit\u2019s deployment to Kuwait, soldiers encountered pay  problems related to hardship duty pay, hostile fire pay, and the combat  zone tax exclusion, all of which are benefits eligible to soldiers when  serving in designated hardship duty locations and hostile fire zones. All 85  of the soldiers deployed overseas were incorrectly paid for either hardship  duty pay or hostile fire pay, most of which were overpayments. In total, 85 soldiers did not receive the full amount of their hardship duty  pay entitlement while deployed to Kuwait.",
      " These soldiers were underpaid a  total of about $8,000. In addition, 76 soldiers continued to receive hardship  duty pay payments following their return from Kuwait. Sixty-six of these  soldiers continued receiving the payments for 6 or more months following  their return home. Overpayments made to all 76 soldiers amounted to  approximately $46,500. This amount does not include the overpayments  made to soldiers involving a type of hardship duty pay that is no longer paid  to soldiers serving in Kuwait. In addition, we estimated that the combat zone tax exclusion benefit was  applied to 76 soldiers late or incorrectly.",
      " We estimated that approximately  75 soldiers received their combat zone tax relief benefits 2 to 3 months late,  which was after their deployment ended, totally $24,000. In addition, one  soldier did not receive all of the combat zone tax exclusion benefits she  was due during her deployment, resulting in an estimated $200  underpayment, while 2 other soldiers were overpaid for a combined  overpayment of about $300. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Soldiers of the 965th Dental Company returned to Fort Hood in two  different groups; the first group returned on May 22,",
      " 2003, and the second  group returned on June 10, 2003. As summarized in table 11, 7 of 93 soldiers  had problems associated with properly stopping their active duty pays and  allowances during their demobilization. Of the soldiers who experienced pay problems associated with this phase,  most had underpayments. One of the soldiers we reviewed had his active  duty pay stopped before his actual demobilization date and another  soldier\u2019s special medical pay was stopped a month early. Each soldier was  underpaid an estimated $1,200. Another soldier\u2019s active duty pay continued  past his demobilization date for an overpayment of approximately $1,",
      "400. In addition, one soldier returned home early from deployment in May 2003  due to a medical emergency. However, his pay and entitlements were not  adjusted correctly. As a result, during his convalescence, much of which  was at his home, the soldier continued to receive hardship duty pay, hostile  fire pay, the family separation allowance, and the combat zone tax  exclusion through April 2004 when we brought the overpayments to the  unit\u2019s attention. 948th Forward Surgical Team, Southfield,  Michigan On January 20, 2003, the 948th Medical Detachment Forward Surgical (948th  Forward Surgical Team)",
      " was mobilized to active duty in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom for a 1-year tour. A total of 20 soldiers from  the 948th Forward Surgical Team, including four surgeons, mobilized at its  home station in Southfield, Michigan, and went through in-processing at  the mobilization station at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin. On February 28, 2003,  the unit deployed to Afghanistan through Baghram Air Base, Afghanistan.  Most of the 20 soldiers remained in Kandahar for about 5 months. While  there, the unit provided emergency medical attention to wounded soldiers  and civilians in and around Kandahar and prepared them for evacuation to  a combat support hospital.",
      " Two surgeons from the team returned in June  2003 and a third soldier returned in July 2003 as a result of a medical  condition and was released from active duty on September 27, 2003.  Sixteen of the remaining 17 soldiers returned to Fort McCoy on August 5,  2003, for demobilization and were released from active duty by August 29,  2003. The 948th Forward Surgical Team\u2019s commander remained in  Afghanistan until August 8, 2003, when he returned to Fort McCoy for  demobilization and was released from active duty on September 4,",
      " 2003. A  time line of the unit\u2019s movements associated with its mobilization under  Operation Enduring Freedom is shown in figure 5. All 20 soldiers in the 948th Forward Surgical Team experienced one or more  pay problems associated with their 2003 mobilization to active duty. As  summarized in table 12, soldiers in the 948th Forward Surgical Team  experienced pay problems during all phases of their active duty  mobilization, with the majority of the problems encountered in the last two  phases. Specifically, we identified pay problems associated with (1) basic  active duty pay, special medical pays,",
      " or allowances for 5 soldiers during  the mobilization phase; (2) basic active duty pay, special medical pays,  allowances, combat zone tax exclusion, or an in-theater incentive pay  associated with the deployment phase for 20 soldiers; and (3) basic active  duty pay, special medical pays, or allowances associated with 18 soldiers\u2019  demobilization from active duty. In total, the pay problems we identified resulted in estimated overpayments  of about $20,700, underpayments of about $2,000, and late payments of  about $5,600. In addition, we identified about $15,",
      "300 and about $130 of  combat zone tax exclusions that were delayed or not refunded,  respectively. Available records showed that about $2,300 of the $20,700 in  identified overpayments were subsequently collected from the soldiers. We were informed of several instances in which the unit\u2019s pay problems  created financial hardships for the unit\u2019s soldiers and their families.  Specifically, several of the unit\u2019s soldiers could not pay their bills while they  were deployed and were forced to borrow money from friends and  relatives in order to meet their financial obligations. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 13, we found that five soldiers from the 948th  Forward Surgical Team experienced underpayments,",
      " overpayments, or late  payments related to their active duty pay and allowances associated with  their initial mobilization. Five soldiers experienced a variety of pay problems associated with their  mobilization to active duty. For example, one physician was underpaid the  special medical pay he was entitled to receive while on active duty. In  January 2003, the physician began receiving special medical payments at a  rate lower than he was entitled to receive. In March 2003, DFAS identified  and corrected this error by paying the physician the correct special medical  pay. However, DFAS did not retroactively pay the physician the correct  medical pay covering the first 39 days he was on active duty.",
      " Another soldier experienced a problem related to his basic pay. The soldier  had previously received a reduction in rank for not completing training  requirements. On February 12, 2003, the commanding officer signed an  order revoking the reduction in rank\u2014after the unit was mobilized to  active duty, but before it was deployed to Afghanistan. The Reserve Pay  Center received the revocation order on March 7, 2003, but did not process  this personnel action until April 4, 2003, resulting in late payments totaling  an estimated $520. Deployment Pay  Problems In late February 2003, the 948th Forward Surgical Team left Fort McCoy and  traveled to Afghanistan.",
      " While in Kandahar, the soldiers experienced  further pay problems related to hardship duty pay, hostile fire pay, and to a  lesser extent, active duty basic pay, basic allowance for housing, family  separation allowance, and special medical pays. They also experienced  problems with respect to their benefits associated with the combat zone  tax exclusion. Table 14 summarizes the pay, allowance, and tax benefit  problems that the 948th Forward Surgical Team encountered during its  deployment. We found that 19 of the 20 soldiers did not receive their initial hostile fire  pay of $150 for February until an average of 47 days after arriving in  Afghanistan.",
      " We also found that one soldier never received her initial  hostile fire pay for February and March totaling $300. She also never  received a retroactive hostile fire payment of $75 for February 2003. All 20 soldiers experienced problems with their hardship duty pay.  Nineteen of the 20 soldiers did not receive their hardship duty pay for  February 2003 until April 2003. For 13 of the 19 soldiers, their February  2003 hardship duty payment was not only late but contained an  overpayment because the payments covered a period when the soldiers  were still at Fort McCoy. Additionally, 19 soldiers continued to receive  hardship duty payments not only after they left the location for which they  were authorized to receive this pay,",
      " but for periods ranging from 1 to 5  months following demobilization. All 20 soldiers waited 67 days before receiving their February combat zone  tax exclusion benefit payment, which averaged $377. We also found that  one soldier was not refunded the total amount of taxes withheld while in  combat zone tax exclusion status. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Eighteen of 20 soldiers in the 948th Forward Surgical Team experienced pay  problems associated with their demobilization from active duty. Seventeen  of the unit\u2019s soldiers returned to Fort McCoy in August 2003 to begin their  demobilization process.",
      " The other 3 left Afghanistan and returned to Fort  McCoy in June and July 2003. As summarized in table 15, soldiers were  overpaid their active duty basic pay, certain allowances, and special  medical pays after their release from active duty, while others never  received (and were therefore underpaid) all of the family separation  allowance or special medical pays they were entitled to receive. We determined that 16 soldiers received 1 or more days worth of active  duty basic pay, special medical pays, or allowances after being released  from active duty. These pay problems occurred because the demobilization  station was late in entering transactions to stop pays and allowances as of  the date the soldiers were released from active duty.",
      " 443rd Military Police Company, Owings Mills,  Maryland The 443rd Military Police Company, headquartered in Owings Mills,  Maryland, has been called to active duty twice since September 11, 2001.  However, only the second mobilization fell within the time period of our  case study analysis. The first mobilization (October 6, 2001, to September  2002) activated 112 soldiers to perform \u201csecure and defend\u201d functions at  Fort Sam Houston in support of Operation Noble Eagle. On February 24,  2003, 121 soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company were mobilized with  the unit,",
      " including 76 who had returned from the deployment to Fort Sam  Houston 5 months prior to this mobilization and 25 soldiers who were  cross-leveled in from other units. These cross-leveled soldiers included 12  soldiers from Puerto Rico, 7 soldiers from Pennsylvania, 3 soldiers from  Maryland, and 1 soldier each from New Jersey, Virginia, and West Virginia. In support of Operation Enduring Freedom, soldiers from the 443rd Military  Police Company reported to the home station in Owings Mills for a SRP  designed to help prepare them for mobilization. They later reported to Fort  Lee, Virginia on February 27,",
      " 2003, for additional mobilization and in- processing procedures. After approximately 2.5 months at Fort Lee, 112  soldiers arrived in Iraq on May 15. Of the 9 remaining soldiers, 1 soldier  arrived in Iraq earlier, on May 14, 1 soldier arrived on September 16, and 7  were on medical hold at Fort Lee for the entire mobilization. While in- theater, the 443rd Military Police Company operated a prison, Camp  Cropper, located near the Baghdad airport. On December 6, 2003, 112 of the  114 soldiers who deployed to Iraq left the Middle East and returned to Fort  Lee.",
      " One of the 2 other soldiers left early\u2014on August 17\u2014and the other left  later\u2014on December 14. The soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company  began demobilizing and returning to their civilian jobs on December 15. By  January 15, 2004, all but 6 of the 121 soldiers had demobilized; the 6  soldiers remained on active duty to receive medical treatment at Fort Lee.  A time line of actions associated with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is  shown in figure 6. As summarized in table 16, soldiers experienced a range of pay problems at  every stage of the 443rd Military Police Company\u2019s tour of active duty.",
      "  Overall, 119 of 121 soldiers who mobilized experienced some type of pay  problem associated with their activation to, during, or deactivation from  federal service in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, we  found that (1) 70 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 114 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active  duty at Camp Cropper, Iraq; and (3) 17 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their  demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments,",
      " underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $25,000, $15,000 and  $20,000, respectively. In addition, soldiers received late payment of their  combat zone tax exclusion benefit totaling about $33,000. Of the  overpayments we identified, about $4,000 were subsequently collected  from the unit\u2019s soldiers. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 17, we found that 67 soldiers from the 443rd Military  Police Company experienced overpayments, underpayments, or late  payments related to basic pay and the associated entitlements when called  to active duty. Before arriving at the mobilization station,",
      " the 99th Regional Readiness  Command performed a SRP for the 443rd Military Police Company at their  home station. This review was designed to prepare soldiers for  mobilization by confirming that their financial documents and personnel  paperwork were in order, as well as verifying that the soldiers were  medically fit to mobilize. The finance portion of the SRP consisted of a  briefing that covered the different entitlements soldiers could expect to  receive and a review of how to read the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay  Accounts. Soldiers who found errors in their individual accounts were  supposed to notify the Regional Readiness Command\u2019s finance personnel  at the SRP,",
      " who would then process the corrections upon returning to their  headquarters and send the necessary documentation to Fort McCoy\u2019s  Reserve Pay Center. Upon reporting to Fort Lee, the 443rd Military Police Company\u2019s active  Army mobilization station, the unit underwent a second SRP, as required by  Army regulations. However, despite going through two SRPs, the soldiers  still experienced various pay problems related to their mobilization. For example, not all of the eligible soldiers in the 443rd Military Police  Company received the proper amount of family separation allowance.  Many of the unit\u2019s soldiers began receiving family separation allowance  earlier than they should have,",
      " resulting in small overpayments that totaled  approximately $550 for the unit. In addition, 15 soldiers received late family  separation allowance payments during mobilization. In addition, the soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company also had  difficulties in starting their basic allowance for housing entitlements and  active duty basic pay. Ten soldiers experienced overpayments and 6  soldiers experienced underpayments of their basic allowance for housing. The 12 soldiers cross-leveled into the 443rd Military Police Company from  Puerto Rico were not entitled to the basic allowance for housing type I  during their mobilization because they were classified as overseas soldiers.  Instead,",
      " these soldiers received basic allowance for housing type II, a cost  of living allowance and an overseas housing allowance. One soldier  received an overpayment of the cost of living allowance and 2 soldiers  received underpayments of their overseas housing allowance entitlements,  all of which occurred because these payments were based on incorrect  rates. Four members of the unit experienced problems starting their active duty  basic pay. Two soldiers received a delay in their promotions, resulting in  nearly $500 in late payments. The two other soldiers had received  demotions that were not promptly entered into DJMS-RC. The first soldier\u2019s  demotion had been effective at the start of the mobilization,",
      " but the soldier  continued to receive payments at the incorrect, higher rate until July 2003.  The resulting overpayments of active duty basic pay, totaling over $2,500,  were not identified by the Reserve Pay Center until we raised questions  about them. The second soldier, however, incurred almost $6,400 in collections when  his demotion was processed 16 months after it became effective, and  despite the fact that his higher rank was restored shortly thereafter. His  demotion occurred because he had been unable to attend training to  maintain his rank before being mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle in  October 2001.",
      " During this mobilization, in February 2002, Army personnel  at the 99th Regional Readiness Command generated a grade reduction  order, but the transaction was not entered into DJMS-RC until June 2003, 4  months after the soldier\u2019s mobilization for Operation Enduring Freedom  and after his deployment to Iraq. Although his previous grade was restored  in July 2003, the restoration was not retroactive, so the soldier still had to  pay back almost $6,400. One problem that occurred during the mobilization process did not have an  immediate effect on the soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company,",
      " but  rather later, during their deployment. In October 2003, 20 soldiers had their  basic allowance for housing switched from the regular entitlement to the  partial basic allowance for housing. In addition, another 16 soldiers had  their family separation allowance entitlements stopped. These changes  occurred because during the SRP process in February, finance personnel  failed to extend the dates of eligibility for the basic allowance for housing  and the family separation allowance to reflect the end date of the current  mobilization. Pay records showed that these 36 soldiers were entitled to  receive one of these entitlements through October 2003, exactly 2 years  after the date of the first mobilization.",
      " While the soldiers were paid for  active duty beyond the October end date of eligibility in the system, the  allowances were automatically turned off by the system. Most of these  problems were caught shortly after occurring and were corrected by the  end of the following month, resulting in about $5,750 of late payments.  However, 4 soldiers failed to have their entitlements turned back on,  resulting in total underpayments of $3,500. Soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company complained that finance  personnel at Fort Lee in March refused to help them and told soldiers that  they needed to contact their unit administrator to fix their problems.",
      " The  unit administrator, who did not mobilize with the unit, voluntarily went to  Fort Lee to help ensure that all of the Company\u2019s soldiers\u2019 pay issues were  addressed. However, finance personnel at Fort Lee asked him to leave after  he attempted to help resolve some of his unit\u2019s pay problems. Despite  spending over 2 months at Fort Lee, many of the pay problems that began  during mobilization were not corrected by the time the soldiers deployed to  Iraq. In fact, 52 of the 121 soldiers left the mobilization station with  unresolved pay-related problems. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 18,",
      " we identified a number of pay problems  associated with active duty pays and allowances during the 443rd Military  Police Company\u2019s deployment while on active duty. While deployed in Iraq, all of the soldiers experienced problems related to  the location-based payments\u2014specifically, problems with hardship duty  pay, hostile fire pay, and the combat zone tax exclusion. All of the 114  soldiers deployed to Iraq with the 443rd Military Police Company  experienced some sort of overpayment, underpayment, or late payment of  at least one of these three entitlements. Soldiers in the 443rd Military Police Company were entitled to $100 per  month for hardship duty pay for serving in Iraq.",
      " However, officials at the  Army area servicing finance office paid the first partial month\u2019s hardship  duty pay more than 2 months after it was due to 107 of the 114 soldiers  deployed to Iraq. Of the remaining 7 soldiers, 4 received hardship duty pay  on time and 3 never received the first partial month\u2019s hardship duty pay  during our audit period. Additionally, none of the 113 soldiers remaining in  Iraq during December 2003 received any hardship duty pay payments for  the partial month they spent in-theater. Soldiers in the unit also  experienced assorted individual problems relating to the payment of the  hardship duty pay entitlement.",
      " For example, 1 soldier who remained on  medical hold at Fort Lee received hardship duty pay payments, totaling  over $350, despite never deploying. Two soldiers each received two  hardship duty pay payments in a given month, resulting in over $150 in  overpayments. Finally, one soldier continued to receive over $300 in  hardship duty pay payments after leaving Iraq in August 2003. Of the 113 soldiers entitled to hostile fire pay during the deployment, 3  experienced some sort of problem with this pay. Two soldiers received  overpayments of hostile fire pay, including 1 soldier who continued to  receive hostile fire pay after he left the in-theater location and another  soldier who erroneously received $300 in hostile fire pay instead of the  correct $225 amount for 1 month.",
      " This second soldier also received part of  his May 2003 hostile fire pay 75 days after it was due. Finally, 1 other soldier  experienced a $450 underpayment of hostile fire pay because he stopped  receiving the entitlement before leaving Iraq. Of the 114 soldiers deployed to Iraq, 112 received their first month\u2019s combat  zone tax exclusion more than 30 days after they were entitled to it. This  resulted in late payments totaling over $33,000, more than the late  payments from all other sources combined. Additionally, 3 soldiers  experienced overpayments and underpayments related to the combat zone  tax exclusion.",
      " One of these soldiers erroneously received over $250 as a  combat zone tax exclusion repayment related to a bonus payment that was  taxable. Another soldier did not receive his combat zone tax exclusion  repayment for the last 2 months of his mobilization, creating an  overwithholding of over $400. We were unable to determine the extent to which one additional soldier in  the unit experienced problems with his combat zone tax exclusion,  hardship duty pay, and hostile fire pay during the mobilization. His DD  Form 214, Certificate of Release and Discharge from Active Duty, stated  that the soldier served with his unit in theater from May 15,",
      " 2003, to  December 6, 2003. However, the soldier did not receive any of these  location-based entitlements during his tour of duty. Pay personnel at Fort  McCoy stated that his records indicate he was on convalescent leave (leave  for soldiers returning to duty after illness or injury) from May 21 to July 16,  and therefore may not have been entitled to these allowances. Pay  personnel at Fort McCoy were continuing to research this case and could  not tell us anything further. Without additional information, we could not  determine whether this soldier was paid correctly. In addition, during this phase,",
      " some of the soldiers of the 443rd Military  Police Company also experienced various individual problems with active  duty basic pay, the basic allowance for housing, and the overseas housing  allowance. Because of delays in promotions, six soldiers experienced late  payments of active duty basic pay and four of these soldiers also  experienced late payments of basic allowance for housing. Other problems  included one soldier who received overpayments of the basic allowance for  housing throughout the mobilization, totaling over $850, because her  spouse was a service member who periodically went on and off duty. Two  other soldiers had their overseas housing allowance paid inconsistently  and at varying rates,",
      " creating net overpayments for both soldiers. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty The soldiers of the 443rd Military Police Company began to demobilize in  December 2003. As summarized in table 19, some soldiers continued to  experience pay problems throughout their demobilization and even after  release from active duty. These problems consisted primarily of differences  between the last dates for which soldiers were paid and the dates of release  from active duty as recorded on the DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or  Discharge from Active Duty. Of the 115 soldiers who demobilized by the end of our audit period,",
      "  including 2 who had been on medical hold, 6 soldiers were paid beyond  their date of demobilization and 2 soldiers had their pay stopped shortly  before demobilizing. The 6 soldiers paid beyond their date of  demobilization were overpaid for an average of 19 days and nearly $2,500  each. This includes 1 soldier who was overpaid for at least 68 days and  $10,500. This soldier, who demobilized in February 2004, stated that he  contacted his demobilization station, home unit, and the pay section of the  Regional Readiness Command by early April,",
      " but nevertheless continued to  be paid through April 2004. The 2 soldiers whose pays were stopped before  demobilizing were underpaid a total of almost $400. In addition to the problems associated with the date of release from active  duty, several soldiers experienced other problems related to their  demobilization. For example, the demobilization station processed  \u201chardship duty pay for certain places\u201d for 1 soldier from May 2003 to  December 2003. This type of hardship duty pay has not been authorized for  newly deployed soldiers since December 2001 and the soldier had received  his correct \u201chardship duty pay for designated areas\u201d while he was deployed  in Iraq.",
      " This erroneous transaction during the soldier\u2019s out-processing  created an overpayment of approximately $150 that went undetected.  Additionally, 7 of the 12 soldiers cross-leveled into the 443rd Military Police  Company from Puerto Rico experienced late payments of their last month\u2019s  overseas housing allowance entitlement, totaling almost $1,500. FORSCOM Support Unit, Finksburg, Maryland A major in the Army\u2019s Individual Ready Reserve, who lives in Maryland,  volunteered for active duty. He received orders mobilizing him to active  duty on March 6, 2003, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The major  was activated as a separate one-person unit.",
      " Because he was mobilized  from an inactive status, he did not have a home unit. He reported to Fort  McPherson, Georgia, on March 6, 2003, where he participated in an Army  SRP. On March 9, 2003, he reported to Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for  training. Because he was to serve as an Army liaison to the Air Force while  deployed, on March 17, 2003, he reported to Seymour Johnson Air Force  base in North Carolina, where he underwent an Air Force mobilization in- processing review with the Air Force\u2019s 4th Fighter Wing.",

He was assigned to serve as an Army Forces Command  (FORSCOM) Ground Liaison Officer attached to the Air Force\u2019s 379th  Expeditionary Force at the Air Force base at Doha, Qatar. As a Ground  Liaison Officer, he was responsible for a team of Army officers that briefed  Air Force pilots before every mission during the Iraqi offensive on the latest  information concerning the location of Army troops and enemy forces. He  was also responsible for providing briefings to the Air Force general in  charge of flight operations at Doha on the status and positions of coalition  ground forces.",
      " He served in this capacity until May 1, 2003, when he left  Qatar. On May 2, 2003, he underwent Air Force active duty outprocessing  with the Air Force\u2019s 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.  He arrived at Fort McPherson on May 4, 2003, for demobilization  processing. He was demobilized from active duty on May 15, 2003, and  returned to his home in an inactive status as a member of the Army\u2019s  Individual Ready Reserve.

      "  Key events associated with the major\u2019s active duty pays and allowances for  his 2003 mobilization are summarized in figure 7. As summarized in table 20, this one-soldier unit experienced various pay  problems associated with his location-based active duty pays and  allowances that continued until well after his demobilization to Individual  Ready Reserve status. Specifically, we found that this single-soldier unit (1)  did not have any underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during  initial mobilization; (2) experienced overpayments and late payments  associated with deployment location-based pays, allowances, and related  tax benefits;",
      " and (3) continued to experience problems with active duty  pays, allowances, and related tax benefits for months after his  demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with overpayments and late payments we  identified were about $8,000 and $300, respectively. Of the overpayments  we identified, all were subsequently collected from the soldier by May 31,  2004. Mobilization Pay  Problems Finance personnel at the soldier\u2019s mobilization station at Fort McPherson,  Georgia, started his active duty pay entitlements associated with his initial  mobilization. We did not identify any pay problems associated with the  soldier\u2019s initial mobilization to active duty.",
      " Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 21, we identified active duty pay and combat zone  tax benefit problems associated with the soldier\u2019s assigned deployment  location while on active duty. When the soldier arrived at his assigned  active duty deployment location in Qatar on March 25, 2003, he was entitled  to receive hardship duty pay and was entitled to exempt his pay from  federal taxes while assigned to that location. However, while the soldier  went through an Air Force in-processing procedure when he arrived in  Qatar, there were no procedures in place to provide flight manifest  documentation to an Army area servicing finance office notifying it of his  arrival.",
      " Such documentation is necessary to start the soldier\u2019s hostile fire  pay and related combat zone tax exclusion benefits. Because he was  assigned to support an Air Force operation, he did not process through, or  have any access to, an Army area servicing finance office to start his  location-based pays and related tax benefits. It was not until he left Qatar  and arrived at his demobilization station at Fort McPherson that finance  personnel at that location received supporting documentation from the  soldier and took the actions necessary to process transactions for him to  receive his pay and tax benefit entitlements. Consequently, he did not  receive any of his hostile fire pay until May 21,",

Army finance officials did not initiate the soldier\u2019s hostile fire pay and  combat zone tax exclusion benefit, which he was entitled to receive  beginning in March 2003, until officials at his demobilization station took  action to start this pay and tax benefit. The soldier was deployed to serve  as an Army liaison to an Air Force unit with an Air Force finance office; he  was unable to find anyone at or near his deployed location who could help  him get his entitled location-based pay and related tax benefits started.",
      " Air  Force finance personnel told the soldier to contact finance personnel back  in the United States at Fort McPherson to address his pay problems. The  soldier told us that while he was in Qatar he was able to contact DFAS by e- mail, but officials there told him there was little they could do to help him  get his location-based pays and tax benefits started. He said that telephone  calls to the United States were difficult because of time differences and his  limited access to phones to make an overseas call. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty The soldier left Qatar on May 1,",

Fort McPherson issued orders to demobilize him from  active duty to the Army\u2019s Individual Ready Reserve as of May 15, 2003. As  summarized in table 22, during his demobilization and after his release  from active duty, the soldier continued to experience pay problems. These  problems were overpayments associated with the soldier receiving active  duty pay after the date of his demobilization from active duty. The soldier out-processed through Fort McPherson and received his DD  Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty,",
      " with a  release from active duty date of May 15, 2003. However, finance personnel  at the Fort McPherson demobilization station did not take action to stop his  active duty pays and allowances as of that date. As a result, he continued to  receive active duty pays and allowances that he was not entitled to receive  for a month after his demobilization\u2014from May 16 through June 13, 2003.  In addition, he continued to receive his combat zone tax exclusion benefits  for the same period, May 16 through June 13, even though he had not only  left the combat zone,",
      " but had already demobilized from active duty and  returned home. The income tax withholdings for this period were refunded  directly to the soldier. His pay was not stopped at the end of his active duty  tour initially because finance personnel at Fort McPherson were waiting  for his hardship duty pays to \u201cclear,\u201d but they then forgot to stop all pays  related to active duty. This failure to stop the soldier\u2019s active duty pays and allowances on time  resulted in the soldier writing a $6,150.75 check to DFAS in an attempt to  resolve all overpayment issues associated with his mobilization. As  summarized in table 23,",
      " the soldier undertook a series of time-consuming  phone calls and faxes to Fort McPherson, DFAS-Indianapolis, DFAS- Denver, and DFAS-Cleveland over a 13-month period to finally get his pay  issues resolved. Ultimately, the soldier\u2019s pay issues related to his March and  April 2003 active duty deployment were only identified and resolved  through the relentless efforts of the soldier and our inquiries into the  matter. With the soldier\u2019s recent $1,140.54 check to DFAS, his pay issues  with his March and April 2003 mobilization were resolved\u2014over a year  after his deployment ended.",

Twenty-seven soldiers with the 629th Transportation  Detachment received orders to mobilize; but only 24 soldiers actually  deployed with the unit. The unit arrived at its home station, Fort Eustis,  Virginia, on March 15, 2003, where it began the SRP in-processing. On  March 18, 2003, the soldiers continued their mobilization processing at Fort  Eustis, Virginia,",

On May 22, 2003, the 629th  Transportation Detachment was deployed to Kuwait and was assigned  responsibility for tracking supplies in and out of Army field locations in and  around Kuwait. After completing its assigned mission, the unit left Kuwait  on December 5, 2003, to return to its demobilization station. By the end of  January 2004, all of the soldiers were released from active duty with the  exception of 1 soldier who was placed on medical hold.",
      " A time line of key  actions associated with the unit\u2019s mobilization under Operation Enduring  Freedom is shown in figure 8. As summarized in table 24, all 24 of the deployed soldiers experienced at  least one pay problem associated with their activation to, during, and  deactivation from, active duty service in support of Operation Enduring  Freedom. Specifically, we found that (1) 5 soldiers experienced  underpayments or late payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 24  soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late payments  during their tour of active duty in and around Kuwait, including in-theater  incentives such as hostile fire pay and hardship duty pay;",
      " and (3) 1 soldier  was underpaid entitled pays and allowances associated with his  demobilization. In total, we identified estimated overpayments of about $3,000,  underpayments of about $2,000, and late payments of about $14,000,  associated with the pay problems we identified. Specifically, we  determined the following:   More than half of the $3,000 in overpayments we identified was  associated with the majority of the unit\u2019s soldiers receiving an extra $75  payment of hostile fire pay during their tour of active duty in Kuwait. More than 70 percent of the soldiers deployed to Kuwait did not receive  hardship duty pay in the months of May and December 2003,",
      "  contributing to the underpayments of $2,000. An estimated $8,000 of the $14,000 in late payments we identified were  associated with two soldiers. Available pay records for one soldier show  he did not receive the correct amount of basic allowance for housing  during his active duty tour until 9 months after his mobilization date.  Another soldier did not receive the correct amount of basic pay and  basic allowance for housing until approximately 3 months after his  promotion had become effective. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 25, we identified several soldiers who experienced  underpayments or late payments related to basic pay and associated  entitlements associated with the mobilization phase.",
      " Most, if not all, of  these cases were likely the result of proper documentation not being  submitted promptly, resulting in some soldiers receiving delayed housing  allowances and promotions. For example, one soldier did not receive the  correct amount of basic pay and basic allowance for housing based on a  promotion that should have been effective in January 2003 but did not get  processed until 3 months later in mid-April. We found the personnel action  form was not signed until April 2003. Upon receipt of individual mobilization orders, the unit\u2019s soldiers reported  to their unit\u2019s home station in Fort Eustis, Virginia,",
      " where they attended a  SRP. The purpose of this SRP was to ensure that all soldiers had all  required administrative paperwork, financial documents, and were  physically fit for the ensuing mobilization. Personnel from the 99th Regional  Readiness Command sent a team who conducted the finance portion of the  SRP to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial documentation. If  necessary, the 99th Regional Readiness Command team submitted  transactions with the necessary supporting documentation to the Reserve  Pay Center at Fort McCoy to update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay  Accounts to correctly reflect their mobilized pay status. However, we  identified several soldiers who did not have appropriate supporting  documentation maintained in their files to justify basic allowance for  housing payments.",
      " For example, we identified 12 soldiers who received  basic allowance for housing payments for which we were unable to obtain  supporting documentation (i.e., DA Form 5960). Total basic allowance for  housing payments for those 12 soldiers amounted to over $110,000. Additionally, we identified inconsistencies with the determinations of  soldiers\u2019 entitlements to the family separation allowance made at the  mobilization station. According to the DOD FMR Volume 7A, soldiers  should be separated from their families by more than 50 miles in order to  receive the family separation allowance. We found 10 soldiers from the  629th Transportation Detachment,",
      " including the soldier who was placed on  medical hold, who received the family separation allowance while at their  home station and mobilization station even though that location was less  than 50 miles from their home. The soldiers were never informed by pay  technicians at the unit or at their mobilization station that they were not  entitled to the family separation allowance if they were staying at Fort  Eustis but their home of record was within 50 miles, and we did not see any  documentation showing that the unit commander had approved an  exception to the mileage restriction on family separation allowance  eligibility. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 26,",
      " we identified a number of pay problems with  five different types of active duty pays and allowances associated with the  unit\u2019s deployment while on active duty. During the soldiers\u2019 deployment to Kuwait, all 24 of the 629th  Transportation Detachment\u2019s soldiers encountered pay problems related to  hardship duty pay and hostile fire pay. Most soldiers did not receive any  hardship duty pay during the month they arrived in-theater and the month  that they left the theater. In addition, all of the soldiers received their  combat zone tax exclusion benefit at least one month late. Per DOD FMR Volume 7A, soldiers who perform duties in designated areas  for over 30 days are entitled to the hardship duty pay incentive.",
      " The  regulation specified the general area of Kuwait as a designated area and  provided $100 a month to all soldiers serving there. Per the same  regulation, soldiers serving in Kuwait are also entitled to hostile fire pay of  $225 per month. Both hardship duty pay and hostile fire pay should start at  the same time upon the soldier\u2019s arrival in Kuwait. In the case of the 629th  Transportation Detachment, the soldiers had their military identification  cards swiped into the Tactical Personnel System upon landing in Kuwait to  document their date of arrival. However, most of the soldiers never  received any payment for hardship duty pay in the month that they arrived  in Kuwait,",
      " nor did most receive any hardship duty pay payment in the  month that they left Kuwait. Officials at the local Army area servicing  finance office did not initiate the unit\u2019s hostile fire pay incentive until 1  month after the soldiers arrived in theater. Furthermore, the soldiers  incorrectly received a hostile fire pay payment of $300 during the month of  June (an overpayment of $75). One of the unit\u2019s soldiers left Kuwait earlier  than the rest of the unit, but the soldier\u2019s hardship duty pay continued for  another 6 months and his hostile fire pay continued for 1 extra month  before it was stopped. Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty Soldiers of the 629th Transportation Detachment returned to their  demobilization station at Fort Eustis,",
      " Virginia, around December 5, 2003,  and began the SRP out-processing. As summarized in table 27, we identified  one soldier who experienced pay problems associated with the  demobilization phase of his active duty tour. We identified one soldier who did not receive any family separation  allowance payments during the last 3 months of active duty. This soldier\u2019s  home of record was more than 50 miles from the demobilization station in  Fort Eustis, Virginia, and he was not commuting daily. Consequently, he  should have received family separation allowance for these 3 months. Ten  other soldiers in the unit who returned to Fort Eustis and lived within the  50-mile range of the demobilization station and did not have a commander\u2019s  exception on file received $250 per month in family separation allowance  payments until their release from active duty.",
      " By January 2004, all  mobilized soldiers, with the exception of the soldier who was on medical  hold, were released from active duty. 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment New  Haven, Connecticut The 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment was called to active duty in  support of Operation Noble Eagle on December 3, 2002. A total of 11  soldiers from the unit were mobilized to support operations at the  Intelligence and Security Command at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. The 3423rd  Military Intelligence Detachment does not have a unit administrator during  peacetime and had no dedicated unit administrator during the mobilization.",
      "  The unit was called to active duty and reported to its mobilization station,  Fort Lee, Virginia, where the soldiers went through in-processing during  December 2002. After this processing, the unit went to the Army\u2019s National  Ground Intelligence Center in Charlottesville, Virginia, for 1 week of  additional in-processing and was then transferred to Fort Belvoir. For the  next 11 months, the unit carried out its mission to gather and analyze  intelligence information in support of U.S. Army Intelligence and Security  Command operations at Fort Belvoir. In November 2003, the 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment began to demobilize at Fort Lee and by December  2,",
      " 2003, all but 1 soldier had been released from active duty. The unit  reported that the remaining soldier stayed on active duty at Fort Belvoir for  an additional year. A time line of key actions associated with the unit\u2019s  mobilization to active duty is shown in figure 9. As summarized in table 28, soldiers experienced a range of pay problems at  every stage of the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment\u2019s tour of active  duty. The unit did not have a dedicated unit administrator to carry out pay  support responsibilities during its active duty mobilization. Overall, all 11  soldiers in the unit experienced some type of pay problem associated with  their activation to,",

Specifically, we found that (1) 10 soldiers  experienced underpayments, overpayments or late payments during their  initial mobilization; (2) 9 soldiers experienced underpayments,  overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active duty at Fort  Belvoir; and (3) 9 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments during their demobilization. The dollar amounts associated with the overpayments, underpayments,  and late payments we identified were about $18,500, $4,000, and $5,",
      "000,  respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $2,000 were  subsequently collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers as of January 31, 2004. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 29, we found that 10 of the 11 soldiers from the  3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment experienced pay problems related  to basic pay and the associated entitlements when called to active duty. Before mobilization, the unit attended several SRPs put on by the 94th  Regional Readiness Command. Specifically, after September 11, 2001, the  unit received warnings that it might be called up and therefore began  attending SRPs to prepare for impending mobilization.",
      " The unit first  attended a program at the Reserve center in Waterbury, Connecticut, in  October 2001, along with several other units that were definitely  mobilizing. The soldiers attended a second SRP in November 2002. The  finance portion of the SRP consisted of a briefing that covered the different  entitlements soldiers could expect to receive and a review of the soldiers\u2019  Master Military Pay Accounts. Upon reporting to the active Army  mobilization station at Fort Lee, the unit underwent a third SRP. We found 10 of the 11 soldiers in the 3423rd Military Intelligence  Detachment were entitled to the continental U.S.",
      " cost of living allowance  during their mobilization at a rate based on their principal place of  residence at the time they were ordered to active duty. One of these 10  soldiers did not receive the entitlement during his mobilization, resulting in  a $500 underpayment. The 9 remaining soldiers erroneously began  receiving the overseas cost of living allowance rather than the continental  U.S. cost of living allowance at the beginning of the mobilization. In April  2003, all 9 soldiers began correctly receiving continental U.S. cost of living  allowance and the entitlement was paid retroactively in May to 8 of the soldiers for the period December 2002 through March 2003.",
      " The erroneous  payments of the overseas cost of living allowance were collected  immediately for 4 of the soldiers, while the erroneous payments for the  other 4 soldiers were only partially collected later in the mobilization. The  delay in collecting the overseas cost of living allowance for the 4 soldiers  resulted in overpayments of over $3,500 that were not collected in full by  the end of the mobilization. One soldier continued to receive the overseas  cost of living allowance and the continental U.S. cost of living allowance  concurrently through August 2003, totaling more than $2,500. DOD began  to recoup these amounts in October 2003.",
      " In addition to the overpayments  and underpayments associated with overseas cost of living allowance  payments, discrepancies between the overseas and continental U.S. cost of  living allowance rates for 8 of the 9 soldiers led to over $700 in late  payments. We also found that 9 of the 10 soldiers in the 3423rd Military Intelligence  Detachment received family separation allowance overpayments during  mobilization. Because of pay clerks\u2019 confusion regarding family separation  allowance entitlement rules, the 9 soldiers began receiving the family  separation allowance 1 to 3 days earlier than they should have, resulting in  small overpayments that totaled almost $200 for the unit.",
      " Additionally, one soldier in the unit experienced a problem related to his  basic allowance for housing pay during mobilization. Shortly after  mobilization, the soldier\u2019s basic allowance for housing entitlement  erroneously switched from the \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate to the \u201cwithout  dependents\u201d rate for half of December 2002 and for January through March  2003. In April 2003, the soldier was repaid basic allowance for housing at  the \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate for January through March 2003. These  switches resulted in $800 in payments more than 30 days after the soldier  was entitled and almost $200 in underpayments for the period in December  2002 when the soldier did not receive basic allowance for housing at the  \u201cwith dependents\u201d rate.",
      " Furthermore, even though the soldier was  deployed from his home in Connecticut to his active duty location at Fort  Belvior in Virginia, he did not received his family separation allowance for  the entire mobilization, creating an estimated $3,000 underpayment. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 30, we identified a number of pay problems  associated with active duty pays and allowances during the 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment\u2019s deployment while on active duty. Two soldiers experienced individual problems with active duty basic pay,  basic allowance for housing, and foreign language proficiency pay.  Additionally, during their deployment to Fort Belvoir,",
      " the unit\u2019s soldiers  experienced pay problems related to the basic allowance for subsistence  provided to enlisted soldiers. Ten of the 11 soldiers in the unit experienced  some sort of overpayment, underpayment, or late payment associated with  their deployment. Two soldiers experienced problems relating to various pay entitlements  during their deployment. One soldier received about $1,800 in active duty  basic pay and basic allowance for housing payments more than 30 days  after he was entitled to receive them because of a delay in processing his  promotion. Another soldier did not receive his foreign language proficiency  pay for 1 month of his deployment, creating a $100 underpayment.",
      " While we did not count any of the unit\u2019s basic allowance for subsistence  payments as pay problems because of incomplete documentation, seven  enlisted soldiers in the unit experienced significant confusion over whether  they received their correct basic allowance for subsistence payments. The  unit\u2019s enlisted soldiers initially received the regular basic allowance for  subsistence until April 2003. At that time, all basic allowance for  subsistence amounts paid to these soldiers were collected and a different  basic allowance for subsistence rate, called \u201crations in kind not available,\u201d  was retroactively paid to these soldiers. In 2003, rations-in-kind-not-",
      " available payments were about $20 more per month than the regular basic  allowance for subsistence. However, finance personnel at the Intelligence and Security Command (the  unit\u2019s servicing finance office while deployed at Fort Belvoir) determined  that even though the unit was issued orders stating that housing and mess  would not be provided, the soldiers actually could eat at the Fort Belvoir  mess. This resulted in (1) a collection in May of all of the previous rations- in-kind-not available payments to the unit\u2019s soldiers except for payments  for the initial mobilization time prior to arrival at Fort Belvoir, and (2) a  retroactive repayment of the regular basic allowance for subsistence.",
      "  Nevertheless, the enlisted soldiers continued to receive the rations-in-kind- not-available rate from mid-May through July 2003. In July 2003, Fort  McCoy again initiated transactions to collect the rations-in-kind-not- available payments and instead pay regular basic allowance for  subsistence. The regular basic allowance for subsistence then continued  for the rest of the unit\u2019s mobilization, despite the fact that in June 2003, a  committee of finance personnel at Fort Belvoir determined that it was not  feasible for the soldiers to continue to use the mess facilities at Fort Belvoir  because of mission requirements and transportation costs.",
      " Pay Problems  Associated with  Demobilization and  Release from Active  Duty The soldiers of the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment began to  demobilize in November 2003. As summarized in table 31, some soldiers  continued to experience pay problems throughout their demobilization and  release from active duty. Of the 10 soldiers who demobilized by the end of our audit period, 9  continued to receive their active duty pay and entitlements past the date of  separation from the Army. Two of the 9 overpaid soldiers continued to  receive their entitlements for 28 days past the date of demobilization,",
      " while  the remaining 7 soldiers were overpaid for 13 days. This resulted in $14,000  in overpayments of active duty basic pay, basic allowance for housing,  basic allowance for subsistence, and where applicable, the family  separation allowance and foreign language proficiency pay. When demobilizing through Fort Lee, the demobilization finance officials  failed to change the pay status code in DJMS-RC to stop active duty pay for  nine of the unit\u2019s soldiers. The timing of the unit\u2019s release from active duty  made it more difficult to catch and correct these concerns, as the soldiers  demobilized during the Thanksgiving holiday and a particularly severe  snowstorm.",
      " The problem was eventually caught and corrected by the 94th  Regional Readiness Command when personnel examined the Unit  Commander\u2019s Pay Management Report in January 2004. Finance personnel  at the 94th Regional Readiness Command reported that available pay  reports indicated most of the soldiers\u2019 overpayments have now been  collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers. 431st Chemical Detachment Johnstown,  Pennsylvania The 431st Chemical Detachment was called to active duty in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom on January 16, 2003, for a period not to  exceed 365 days. Ten soldiers who received orders to mobilize with the  431st Chemical Detachment reported to their home station in Johnstown,",
      "  Pennsylvania, on January 16, 2003. They underwent an initial SRP at their  Johnstown home station. On January 19, 2003, they arrived at their  designated mobilization station at Fort Dix, New Jersey, where they  remained for the next month undergoing additional in-processing and  training. Approximately 1 month later, around February 22, 2003, 8 of the 10  soldiers from the 431st Chemical Detachment were deployed to Kuwait.  Two soldiers from the unit left for Kuwait 1 month later, on March 20, 2003. The primary mission of the 431st Chemical Detachment while deployed in  and around Kuwait was to track and report nuclear,",
      " biological, or chemical  attacks so that soldiers in the area could take appropriate protective  actions. After completing their mission, all 10 soldiers in the detachment  left Kuwait on May 21, 2003. Upon returning to Fort Dix, the soldiers began  the demobilization process and stayed at Fort Dix until the end of June  2003. For the period of July 1 through July 15, 2003, all of the soldiers in the  431st Chemical Detachment were placed on transitional leave. By July 15,  2003, all of the soldiers had been released from active duty.",

As summarized in table 32, all 10 of the unit\u2019s soldiers experienced some  sort of pay problem, primarily associated with the overseas deployment  phase of their active duty mobilization. Pay problems included  overpayments, underpayments, and late payments of pay entitlements and  incentives, such as family separation allowance, hostile fire pay, and  hardship duty pay associated with their initial mobilization and deployment  to Kuwait. In total, we identified estimated overpayments of about $12,000,  underpayments of about $2,",
      "000, and late payments of about $1,000  associated with the pay problems we identified. Of the estimated $12,000 in  identified overpayments, we identified about $450 that was subsequently  collected. Specifically, we determined that   2 soldiers did not receive correct payments for up to 6 months after their   all 10 soldiers in the unit experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments associated with their tour of active duty deployment in  Kuwait, including problems with hostile fire pay and hardship duty pay. Mobilization Pay  Problems As summarized in table 33, we identified six soldiers with pay problems  related to overpayments of family separation allowance during the unit\u2019s  initial mobilization to active duty.",
      " Upon receipt of individual mobilization orders, the soldiers reported to  their unit\u2019s home station in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where they attended  a SRP. The purpose of this SRP was to ensure that all soldiers had all  required administrative paperwork, financial documents, and were  physically fit for the ensuing mobilization. SRP finance officials were  required to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial documentation and  submit transactions with the necessary supporting documentation to the  Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy to update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military  Pay Accounts to reflect their mobilized status. However, we identified several soldiers who did not have appropriate  supporting documentation maintained in their files to justify their basic  allowance for housing payments.",
      " One soldier appeared to be underpaid for  the basic allowance for housing during the period that he was called to  report to his home station for active duty. During the first pay period of his  mobilization, he was paid at a lower basic allowance for housing rate.  Subsequent payments for the basic allowance for housing throughout his  tour of duty were at a higher rate. We were not able to substantiate the  higher amount through supporting documentation. The total basic  allowance for housing payments to this soldier that could not be verified  amounted to approximately $3,500. Furthermore, we identified four other soldiers who received basic  allowance for housing payments for which we were unable to obtain  supporting documentation (i.e., DA Form 5960). Total basic allowance for  housing payments for those four soldiers amounted to approximately  $30,",
      "000. In addition, we identified six soldiers in the 431st Chemical Detachment  who received overpayments of the family separation allowance because  they began receiving this entitlement upon reporting to their home station,  even though that location was less than 50 miles from their homes and  there was no evidence that they had an unreasonable commuting distance,  as required by DOD FMR Volume 7A. Based on these criteria, the family  separation allowance payments should not have started until the soldiers  reached their mobilization station at Fort Dix, New Jersey. The family  separation allowance overpayments to these soldiers totaled $150. Pay Problems While  Deployed As summarized in table 34,",
      " we found that during the soldiers\u2019 deployment  to Kuwait, they experienced problems related to hardship duty pay and  hostile fire pay. In addition, all of the soldiers received their combat zone  tax exclusion benefit at least 1 month late. Most soldiers did not receive the full amount of their hardship duty pay  while deployed. Moreover, they continued to receive hardship duty pay  well after they had returned to Fort Dix and demobilized. In total, all 10  deployed soldiers were incorrectly paid for either hardship duty or hostile  fire pay. Soldiers of the 431st Chemical Detachment who deployed overseas had  their identification cards scanned into the Tactical Personnel System upon  landing at Kuwait International Airport.",
      " However, the unit\u2019s hostile fire  payments did not start until more than 2 months after the soldiers arrived  in theater. Moreover, it took approximately 3 months from the time that the  soldiers arrived to start receiving hardship duty payments. In fact, hardship  duty payments were not processed until May 21, 2003, the same day that  the soldiers left the designated hardship duty location. These delays resulted in the deployed soldiers being underpaid for most of  their time while serving in the hardship duty location. Furthermore,  hardship duty pay continued for another 7 months after the soldiers had  left Kuwait. As a result,",
      " the soldiers continued to receive payments of  hardship duty pay after their demobilization and release from active duty.  Also, local Army area servicing finance officials did not terminate  payments of hostile fire pay for the 2 months following the soldiers\u2019 return  to the United States. These two breakdowns in the process of paying the  correct in-theater incentives to soldiers in a timely manner resulted in  underpayments or late payments at the front end of the soldiers\u2019  deployment and overpayments after the soldiers had returned. In addition, the unit administrator, who also deployed with the unit, stated  that she had trouble finding anyone in the local Army area servicing finance  office in Kuwait to assist with getting the unit\u2019s hostile fire pay started.",
      "  Since the 431st Chemical Detachment was working for the Marine Corps  and was far away from the Army area servicing finance office, the unit was  given the number at Fort Doha as its supporting finance office in Kuwait.  The unit administrator made repeated telephone attempts to contact the  finance office at Fort Doha but could only reach a recording that told her to  call back later. This gap in a functioning supporting finance office for the  deployed soldiers added to their frustration and confusion over in-theater  pays. Upon the unit\u2019s return to the U.S. in May 2003, most of the soldiers noticed  that they continued to receive an additional $100 per month for 7 additional  months.",
      " However, because their Leave and Earnings Statements were not  clear as to what the payments represented, the soldiers contacted the unit  administrator for assistance. The unit administrator determined that the  payments represented erroneous hardship duty pay and tried to go through  the unit\u2019s chain of command to get the payments stopped, but received no  response. The unit administrator also accessed the pay hotline at 888-PAY- ARMY, but was placed on hold for such a long time that she gave up.

    "answer": "In light of GAO's November 2003 report highlighting significant pay problems experienced by Army National Guard soldiers mobilized to active duty in support of the global war on terrorism and homeland security, GAO was asked to determine if controls used to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers provided assurance that such payments are accurate and timely. GAO's audit used a case study approach to focus on controls over three key areas: processes, people (human capital), and automated systems. The processes and automated systems relied on to provide active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are so error-prone, cumbersome, and complex that neither DOD nor, more importantly, Army Reserve soldiers themselves, could be reasonably assured of timely and accurate payments. Weaknesses in these areas resulted in pay problems, including overpayments, and to a lesser extent, late and underpayments, of soldiers' active duty pays and allowances at eight Army Reserve case study units. Specifically, 332 of 348 soldiers (95 percent) we audited at eight case study units that were mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the 18-month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at least one pay problem. Many of the soldiers had multiple problems associated with their active duty pays and allowances. Some of these problems lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of time, some for over 1 year. Further, nearly all soldiers began receiving their tax exemption benefit at least 1 month late. These pay problems often had a profound adverse impact on individual soldiers and their families. For example, soldiers were required to spend considerable time, sometimes while deployed in remote, hostile environments overseas, seeking help on pay inquiries or in correcting errors in their active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits. The processes in place to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers, involving potentially hundreds of DOD, Army, and Army Reserve organizations and thousands of personnel, were deficient with respect to (1) tracking soldiers' pay status as they transition through their active duty tours, (2) carrying out soldier readiness reviews, (3) after-the-fact report reconciliation requirements, and (4) unclear procedures for applying certain pay entitlements. With respect to human capital, weaknesses identified at our case study units included (1) insufficient resources allocated to key unit-level pay administration responsibilities, (2) inadequate training related to existing policies and procedures, and (3) poor customer service. Several automated systems issues also contributed to the significant pay errors, including nonintegrated systems and limited processing capabilities.\n",
